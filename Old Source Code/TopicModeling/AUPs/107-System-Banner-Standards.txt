This standard is for system 
administrators and owners responsible for
 
the
 
implementation and maintenance of UCF systems.
 
The standard outlines different banners for end user
 
systems versus
 
systems that perform 
administrative

consents
 
under which th

regulations as well as state and national laws
.
 
Further, it indicates
 
thei
r consent
 
to monitoring of 
their usage. Finally, they outline possible consequences to 
violations
 
and other unacceptable use.
 
 
The UCF 
Information Security Office has developed the following statements to meet this need.
 
 
STANDARDS
:
 
1.

must
 
be placed such that users must read and agree before access to the
