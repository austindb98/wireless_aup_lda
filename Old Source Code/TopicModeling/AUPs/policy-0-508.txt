INTRODUCTION
 
(Purpose and Intent)
 
It is the policy of the 
University of South Florida System (University/USF) that all information 
utilized in the course of business, research, and education is considered an asset, and as such, 
administration, faculty, staff, and students are responsible and accountable for its v
iability and 

security and integrity of confidential information that is transmitted, stored or maintained using 
information technology resources through th
e appropriate legal, auditable controls that will protect 
the information from unauthorized access, intentional or accidental disclosure, modification, 
destruction, denial of service, or misappropriation of data or hardware.
 
The purpose of this policy is t
o define the overall information security structure which will insure 
the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of all critical University data and information systems.  
Components of that structure may be found by reference to individual University
 
organizational 
units.  Due to the continued proliferation and distribution of computing and information systems 
across the entire University, an effective structure must be distributed and a consistent program for 
addressing security is required.
 
This pol
icy establishes the organizational structure and processes applicable to the University of 
South Florida System to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding the 
security and confidentiality of information that is transmitted, store
d, maintained; or otherwise 
utilized information technology resources.
 
 

II. 
SCOPE
 
This policy will apply at all University of South Florida System locations and to information and 
systems when used remotely from University locations.
 
III. 
STATEMENT OF POLI
CY
  
 
 
A.
 
Information Security Manager (ISM)
 
The Information Security Manager is responsible for University
-
wide efforts related to data and 
information system security, such as development of USF data security policies, negotiation and 
evaluation of site 
licenses for security
-
related software, training, coordination of efforts to improve 
data security controls, and dissemination of security
-
related information and incidents, which could 
affect the availability, and integrity of computing resources on campu
s.
 
When security issues with a particular University computing resource arise in such manner that 
threaten the integrity and availability of the University computing infrastructure, the ISM, under 
advice of the other members of the Incident Response Team, 
has the authority and responsibility to 
isolate the offending computing resource until the issue has been resolved.
 
The ISM will maintain communications with the Information Security Officers and Administrators, 
regularly educating and updating them on inf
ormation security issues that may need to be addressed.
 
B.
 
Information Security Workgroup (ISW)
 
The Information Security Workgroup is the steering committee responsible for recommending 
policies and assisting in the overall coordination of the University i
nformation security program.  It 
will advise the Information Security Manager on the development and maintenance of standards and 
guidelines that will direct the Information Security Officers in their role.  The Information Security 
Workgroup will also ass
ist the Information Security Manager on evaluating risk analysis surveys 
completed by individual University units.
 
The ISW is responsible for incorporating methods for a systematic, University
-
wide, risk assessment 
framework through which appropriate chang
es in policy, standards, and guidelines will be 
implemented and enforced.  This framework will be continuously re
-
evaluated to respond to 
developing information security issues. The results of this risk assessment will be submitted to the 
Information Techn
ology Management Council (ITMC) with enough supporting information to 
allow the ITMC to make a decision on the acceptable level of risk for the University.
 

The Information Security Workgroup will be chaired by the Information Security Manager.  Its 
members
hip will be reviewed and updated as appropriate and published in the USF Security 
Website, 
http://www.usf.edu/it/services/data
-
security.aspx
.
 
C.
 
Incident Response Team (IRT)
 
The primary goal
 
of the Incident Response Team is to protect the overall computing infrastructure 
of the University.  The team is responsible for quickly identifying threats to the campus data 
infrastructure, assess the level of risk, and immediately take steps to mitigat
e the risks considered 
critical and harmful to the integrity of University information system resources. IRT members will 
notify local Information Security Officers and Administrators of any incident involving their 
resources.
 
Members of the Incident Respo
nse Team should be notified as soon as an incident is detected 
within the University.  After control is restored, a report must be presented to all members of the 
IRT and local administration, clearly outlining the extent of the breach, and the steps taken
 
to avoid 
future incidents.  These incidents will be reviewed by the ISM as part of the continuous risk 
assessment program.
 
Members of the IRT will perform localized vulnerability assessment as needed and report their 
findings to the appropriate local Info
rmation Security Officer and Information Security 
Administrator.  IRT members will also conduct University
-
wide vulnerability assessments during 
emergency situations, in order to protect the integrity and availability of the University 
infrastructure, and 
take actions as deemed appropriate.
 
The Incident Response Team (IRT) will be composed of the Information Security Manager and key 
members of the campus network administration and security staff.
 
D.
 
Information Security Officer (ISO)
 
It is the responsibilit
y of the head of each department, unit, and division of the University to appoint 
an Information Security Officer (ISO).  Each ISO will have oversight responsibly in their respective 
area for insuring that information security practices are followed.  Curr
ent personnel may be 
designated as an ISO, with the duties and responsibilities becoming an additional part of that 

 

The ISO must understand the importance of security, be capable of learning security basics, and 
most notably, have the authori
ty to carry out the responsibilities assigned.  Additional 
responsibilities include:
 
1.  Adherence to University policies and standards.
 
2.  Ensuring that information security requirements are met for their organizational area 
including the performance of 
continuous risk analysis and business resumption planning in the 
event of technology failure.
 
3.  Help to promote security awareness in their organizational area.
 
4.  Advising administration of security shortfalls.
 
E.
  
Information Security Administrator (I
SA)
 
Technical members of the local computer and network support personnel who also have security
-
related duties are designated Information Security Administrators (ISA).  The ISO may also hold the 
designation of ISA.  The ISAs are responsible for the estab
lishment and maintenance of security for 
computing systems and networks.  The ISO should identify the local Information Security 
Administrators and coordinate their roles and responsibilities with respect to information security.  
The Information Security 
Workgroup will provide assistance in educating the ISOs and ISAs with 
the standards and guidelines of the University.
