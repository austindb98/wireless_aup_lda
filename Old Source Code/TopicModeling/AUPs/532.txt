scholarships include both qualified and non
-qualified scholarship awards.

  Conflict
-of-Interest: 
An action by an individual reviewing and/or recommending a scholarship 
that results in a direct financial benefit to a person closely affiliated to the individual 
making the 
recommendation. Conflict of interest may also occur if an individual exerts influence to select a 
recipient without considering and documenting objective criteria for the scholarship.
  Financial Need
-Based Scholarships: 
Scholarships awarded base
d on financial need as defined 
by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA): 
The FAFSA is the basic student 
financial aid application form used by all two and four
-year colleges, universities, a
nd career 
schools for the awarding of federal student aid and most state and college aid. At USU, the 
Financial Aid Office administers Title IV aid, which is the aid available to students through 
filling out the FAFSA.
  Non
-Qualified Scholarship: 
Any porti
on of an award, scholarship, fellowship, or grant that 
does not directly pay for those items defined as a qualified scholarship. Non
-qualified 
scholarships are includible in the gross income of the recipient and are subject to withholding. 
For non
-degree n
onresident candidates and nonresident post
-doctoral research scholars, the 
entire award is non
-qualified.
  Qualified Scholarship: 
Under section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified 
scholarship is one that is used to pay "tuition and fees paid to e
nroll in, or to attend, an 
educational institution" or "fees, book, supplies, and equipment required for the courses at the 
educational institution." Only qualified scholarship payments made to nonresident aliens are 
neither subject to withholding or IRS r
eporting.
  Scholarship: 
A qualified or non
-qualified grant or payment made to support a student's 
education, awarded on the basis of need or academic or other achievement. Scholarships are not 
repaid. Scholarships may be referred to by various titles (e.g. award, grant, fellowshi
p, etc.).
 However, any titles that fall within the classification of non
-qualified or qualified scholarships 
are considered ﬁscholarshipsﬂ for purposes of this policy.

The Scholarship Office collaborates with scholarship
-awarding colle
ges on 
all scholarship processes and procedures, and provides guidance for maintaining appropriate 
internal controls.
  Scholarship

Any college within Utah State University that issues, 
evaluates, or oversees scholarships as outlined by th
