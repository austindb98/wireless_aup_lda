! - "#UNIVERSITY POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE USE OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
(A)Purpose. Access to modern information technology is essential to Kent state
university's mission of providing the students, faculty and sta
! with educationalservices of the highest quality. The pursuit of the missions of teaching, research
and public service is greatly enhanced by the use of computing systems and
software, access to the world wide web, and other technology resources that are
available to the entire campus community. The preservation of those resources for
the community requires that each faculty member, sta
! member, student or other
authorized user comply with institutional policies, applicable federal and state
laws and responsible use of technical resources.
(B)Operational procedure.
(#)Authorized users of campus computing and network resources shall be
faculty, sta
!, student and other a"liated individuals or organizations
authorized by the vice president for information services.
($)Notwithstanding the geographical location of the user, authorized use of
campus-owned or operated computing and network resources shall be
consistent with the teaching, research and public service mission of Kent
state university and consistent with this policy.
(%)Information technology provides important means for both public and
private communication. Users and systems administrators shall respect the
privacy of person-to-person communications in all forms includingtelephone, electronic mail and Þle transfers, graphics and television to the
fullest extent possible under applicable law and policy. The principle of
academic freedom shall apply to public communication in all these forms of
communication, as well as in the transmission of information in both the
physical and virtual classrooms, subject to the limitations set forth
hereinafter.
(&)Subject to requirements of network administration, Kent state university

shall not monitor or restrict the content of material posted on university-
owned computers, or transported across its networks. However, Kent state
university reserves the right to:
(a)Limit access to its networks; and(b)Remove or limit access to content or to material residing on or
transmitted on university-owned computers or networks when exigent
circumstances arise (i.e., evidence of a reported violation of applicable
university policies, contractual).
(')Determination of violations shall be made in accordance with established
applicable due process procedures (i.e., student code of conduct, collective
bargaining agreement, academic and administrative grievances and appeals
policies, as appropriate).
(()In the normal course of system maintenance, both preventative and
troubleshooting, sta
! members operating the computer systems may be
required to view Þles. Sta
! shall be required to maintain the conÞdentiality
and privacy of information in such Þles unless otherwise required by law or
university policy.
())Kent state university reserves the right, upon reasonable cause for
suspicion, to access all aspects of its computing systems and networks,including individual login sessions to determine if a user is violating thispolicy or state or federal laws.
(*)This policy may be supplemented with additional guidelines or regulations
developed by units and companies that operate their own computers or
networks, provided they are consistent with this policy.
(!)A university member who stores or distributes copyrighted material must
be the copyright holder or have the permission of the copyright holder asrequired under law. This includes duplication of audiotapes, videotapes,
photographs, illustrations, computer software, and all other information for
educational use or any other purpose.(#")No user may, under any circumstances, use Kent state university computing
equipment, software or networks to harass or defame any other person.

(#)Access. The university recognizes the private nature of electronic mail
communications. The university may access such Þles in the course of itsnormal supervision of the network or system (i.e., backing up of electronic
messaging material), or when exigent circumstances arise (i.e., evidence of
reported violations of policies or laws). Accordingly, the private nature of
electronic mail communications sent or received by users on any computer
system owned or operated by the university shall be maintained, subject to
the technology limitations of the university's electronic systems and in a
manner consistent with university polices, state and federal laws.
($)Public records request. From time to time the university may receive
requests pursuant to section 
$()
.
(' of the Revised Code (the Ohio PublicRecords Act). When such requests are for access to a user's e-mail Þles, the
university will make a good faith e
!ort to notify the a!ected user. A good faith
e!ort may include, though not be limited to, an e-mail message sent to the
a!ected user's university e-mail address or telephone notice, including a
message left on the university-based voice mail system.
(%)Security. Kent state university employs various measures to protect the
security of its computing resources and its users' accounts. Users should be
aware, however, that the university cannot guarantee the absolute security
and privacy of data stored on university computing facilities. Users should
therefore engage in safe computing practices including but not limited to
establishing appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding their
passwords, changing them regularly, and by backing up critical Þles when
appropriate.
