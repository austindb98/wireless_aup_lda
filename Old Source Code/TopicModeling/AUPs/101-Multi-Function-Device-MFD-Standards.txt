 5 ACCOUNTABILITY/APPLICABILITY:
 This standard applies to all 
multifunction devices and appliances owned by the University of 
Central Florida
 that are physically and logically capable of supporting the standard.  [ 
STANDARDS
 STATEMENT:
 All who have access to use a
 networked university 
Multi
-Function Devices (MFD) 
have the 
responsibility to ensure the overall security of the data and 
documents 
it processes.  [
Members of 
the university using or administering MFDs should comply 
with the Data Classification and 
Protection policy (4
-008) and the standards set forth in this document.  [ 
BACKGROUND:
 The University of Central Florida has a need to 
centralize
 network capable 
MFD
s throughout the 
campus as a way of reducing the need f
or multiple devices, 
realizing cost savings, 
ease of use, 
less
ening our impact on the environment, and improving 
efficiencies of process. MFDs provide 

great value to the university, but also raise security concerns when not properly configured. 

Securing networked devices is important for a number of reasons: 
Most are simply ﬁplugged
-inﬂ to the network using the minimal settings required to make
the device operate.
Once installed, they rarely receive recommended updates and patches.
Administration of MFDs 
takes place on the network; physical access to the device may

not be required.
Due to increased sophistication (built-
in ﬁintelligenceﬂ) and ever
-increasing storage
capacity, hackers use MFDs to launch attacks, store unauthorized data, retrieve scanned
and printed documents, and print 
unauthorized material.
This Information Security Office (ISO)
 sets the minimum acceptable security standards required 
for
 attaching
 and deploying any MFD to the 
UCF 
network while 
providing for maximum 
security, 
efficiency
, ava
ilability
, and risk reduction.

-Function Device Standards 2
 STANDARDS
: 
When using MFDs, UCF conforms to certain standards to protect documents and the information 
they contain.  [
Listed below are the responsibilities and requirements for 
all users
, departments, 
and administrators
. 
1.Passwords
Follow all user and server level password standards outlined in Standards Document 501
Password Standards
.2.Network
Ensure embedded management 
web interfaces use encryption (e.g.
, SSL with a self
-signed certificate, SSL with a certificate issued from a certificate authority)
.Change default SNMP community strings and use SNMPv3 if possible.
Ensure the 
device
 can only access the internal network and not the external internet
(place 
devices on a non-
NATed
 VLAN
.)To effectively synchronize the 
MFD™s 
time, set the NTP server to the following:
oUCF Time Servers:
time.ucf.edu (Primary)
ucf1.ucf.edu (Secondary)
ucf2.ucf.edu (Tertiary)
ucf3.ucf.edu (Quaternary)
Disable all unused wireless communication technologies (
e.g., 
Wi-Fi, Bluetoot
h, infrared,
etc.)
Transmit restricted data (refer to the Data Classification Policy
 4-008
) by usi
ng only
secure methods such as 
SMTP
s, 
TLS, SSL, SSH, etc. 
 No 
E-
mail
 (SMTP
), 
FTP, HTTP
,or T
elnet
.oUCF IT
 campus wide 
SMTP
 server information:
Enable SSL to 
accept
 all certificates without a Certificate Authority.
Use TLS.
SMTP Server Address:  [ucfsmtps1.mail.ucf.edu.
No 
authentication.
Port:  [25.
Device must use a 10.x.x.x address to utilize SMTPs.
Disable services, applications, and user accounts that are not being utilized.
3.Device Data Settings
Whenever possible, disable the ﬁsave documents, copies, or scans to local device driveﬂ
(sometimes called ﬁe
-fileﬂ) settings
 on the device.  [
NOTE:  [
Make e
very effort
 not to store
data on the local MFD regardless of the 
selected function.

101 Multi
-Function Device Standards 
3  [ Whenever possible, set device to delete documents, spooled files, images, and other 
temporary data using secure 
overwrite between jobs
.  [Whenever possible, set the device to mask the file
 names sent to it for processing.
  [Use encryption methods to protect data on the drive
.  [ When the MFD
 requires
 maintenance or the 
college and/or 
department 
intends to discard 
the uni
t, always cleanse
/degauss
 the magnetic media
. o Always e
rase and over write
 all documents
. o Always erase a
ny address books on the device
. o Use software to wipe the drive

the option to use the ﬁToshiba Data Overwrite Kit.ﬂ  [Contact UCF Business Services for

  [4. Logs
  [Enable 
detailed system logging.
  [Review
 audit
 logs on a regular basis
.  [All devices must follow the
 State of Florida Records Retention Schedule
. 5. Physical Security
  [MFD should be physically located in an access
-controlled environment.
  [Disable users
™ ability to modify
 any global configuration settings.
 6. Education
  [Alert employees and students to the risk of making copies
 off
-site 
and provide
 information 
regarding
 the 
university™s
 data policies
 (refer to the Data Classification 
Policy 4
-008)
.  [This is also an opportunity to reinforce the need to protect PII.
  [Encourage users and employees to follow proper cross
-shredding disposal procedures for
 all 
hard
-copy 
documents while adhering to the State of Florida Records Retention 
Schedule.
  [Notify the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) of any incidences
 that
 arise.
  [Contact 
information provided below.

 DEFINITIONS:
 Audit logs:
  [A 
registry that shows the identifier, date, and time that stored data is accessed.
 Cross shredding
:  [The process of using a shredder to cut paper both vertically and horizontally to 
provide more completely destroy
ed documents.  [
Data
:  [
Numerical or other information represented either in a physical form or in a form suitable 
for electronic processing or storage.
 Degaussing
:  [The process of completely removing information from electronic media so that 
retrieving the data is impossible.
 Employees:
  [Individuals acting on behalf of the university in processing, storing, and retrieving 
data.  [This includes any paid or volunteer acting on behalf of the university. 
Encrypted or truncated:  [Data converted to a code or shortened for security purposes. 
Information Security Office (ISO
):  [The mission of the Information Security Office is to provide 
a secure infrastructure that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of inf
ormation 
resources.  [To this end, the ISO develops security best practices, coordinates security issues, 
conducts investigations, and works with Information Technology (IT) and other campus 

departments to minimize security risks and assure compliance with 
security policies and 
procedures. 
Multi
-Function Device (MFD):  [A
n office machine that incorporates the functionality of multiple 
devices in one to provide centralized document management, distribution, or production in a 
office setting.  [A typical MFD
 may act as a combination of some or all of the following devices: 
printer, scanner, photocopier, email, or fax.  [
Network Address Translation (NAT
):  [The process of modifying network address information in 
datagram (IP) packet headers while in transit 
across a traffic routing device for the purpose of 
remapping one IP address space into another.  [Antonym:  [Non-NATed, for UCF™s purposes, only 

allows network traffic within the network.  [Non-NATed network traffic cannot be sent outside 
the UCF network because it is non-
routable.
 Network Time Protocol (NTP
):  [A protocol that allows other servers to download and 
synchronize to the official network time. 
Personal Restricted Data
:  [
(Also called Personally Identifiable Information or PII)  [P
ersonal 
Restri
cted Data includes personally identifiable information.  [This is any information from which 
an individual may be uniquely and reliably identified or contacted (e.g.,  [social security number, 
account relationships, account numbers, account balances, account histories, and passwords). 

101 Multi
-Function Device Standards 5
 Virtual LAN (VLAN
):
  [A group of hosts with a common set of requirements that communicate 
as if they were attached to the same broadcast domain, regardless of their physical location.  [A 
VLAN has the same attributes as a phy
sical LAN but reconfiguring the network is accomplished 
through software instead of physically relocating devices.
