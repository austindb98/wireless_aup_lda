URPOSE
 
All individuals and organizational units that use or access university data, technology, and user 
credentials must comply with state and federal laws, statutes, and regulations; must comply with 
all a
pplicable university policies, standards, and procedures; must have prior authorization for 
related activities based on job duties or other demonstrated need, and must not compromise the 
appropriate availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, or sec
urity of data, technology, and 
user credentials.
 
 
In order to successfully carry out its mission, USC will act to protect the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of data, technology, and user credentials. USC promotes responsible 
use and prohibits
 
unauthorized use of these university assets, including for personal or other non
-
university purposes. Such use may be grounds for investigation and disciplinary action.

EFINITIONS
 
AND 
A
CRONYMS
 
Constituents 
are persons and entities that have a 
relationship to any organizational unit of the 
university system, including but not limited to: students (prospective students, applicants for 
admission, enrolled students, campus residents, former students, and alumni), employees (faculty, 
staff, administ
rators, student employees, prospective employees, candidates for employment, 
former employees and retirees), and other affiliates (including but not limited to board members, 
consultants, contractors, donors, invited guests, recipients of goods and service
s, research subjects, 
and volunteers).
 
 
Consumable Software and Devices 
are items purchased by the university which would cost more 
to track, reclaim, or redistribute than the original purchase price.
 
 
Data and Information 
(Data) are, individually or 
collectively, the known values, content, media 
(audio, visual, multimedia), information, intellectual property, official reports, and work product 
which the university or its organizational units collect, issue, produce, process, purchase, transmit, 
mainta
in and/or store regarding university Constituents, business processes, events, operations, 
performance, and services. See also University Data (UNIV 1.51).
 
 
Personal Matters 
are individual or family concerns that are not related to the university, such as 
community activities and outside employment, including promotion, solicitation, services, or 
sales.
 
 

 
2
 
Personal Technology Assets 
are items that have been purchased, provided, or otherwise obtained 
by the User and are not considered university property. Exam
ples include smart phones, tablets, 
personal computers, home network, and third
-
party services such as email and cloud storage.
 
 
Principle of Least Privilege 
(POLP) holds that every user of an asset should be authorized to, and 
should use, only the least s
et of privileges, rights, and 
permissions necessary
 
to complete an 
assigned job or responsibility. In cases where assets, information systems, and services do not 
support strict controls, users are obligated to abide by POLP in their individual activities.
 
 
University Business 
describes processes, transactions, communications, and records produced or 
received by a USC employee or a party acting on behalf of the university, regarding actions, 
operations, services, and Constituents of the university or its un
its, as well as official university 
reports, requests, policies, and procedures; any matter subject to Freedom of Information Act (see 
UNIV 2.00) is considered University Business. Such data may include, but is not limited to, human 
resources, student reco
rds, alumni/development, and other administrative information; data 
classified as Restricted, Confidential, or Internal Use is most often included (see UNIV 1.51).
 
 
The term University Business excludes teaching and learning activities, as well as academic
 
research data, personal property, items that are public record, and intellectual property (see 
ACAF 1.33).
 
 
University Technology Assets 
are university owned hardware, devices, equipment, virtual 
desktop, software, information systems and services (whethe
r on premises or not), databases and 
data stores, datacenters, learning management systems, network (including wired, wireless, 
Internet, and Virtual Private Network), audio, video, communications and telephony, which the 
university purchases, provides, or
 
otherwise acquires.
 
 
User Credentials 
are accounts, email accounts, network username, other user names, identifiers 
and identity badges, digital identities (including those generated internally or under agreement 
with a third party or federated identity s
ervice), and the associated access rights, authorization, and 
services, which the university collects, requires, or issues in order to enable users to access data, 
information, communications, and/or technology, including for authentication.
 
 
User 
(or End 
User) refers to any person or system that accesses university assets including data 
and information systems.
