.$ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY ON ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SECURITY
(A)Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to enable the use of innovative technologyby members of the university community while utilizing available resources to
mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure. All computer systems either
accessing or storing institutional data or operating on the university network must
meet the information security standards as deÞned or otherwise referenced in this
rule.(B)DeÞnitions.(#)Application.  A set of one or more computer programs designed to permit
users to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities.
Examples of applications include but are not limited to: student support
systems, administrative support systems, databases, and other application
programs installed by the user or administrator on a device or server. For the
purpose of this rule, covered applications are limited to those applications
running or installed on university-owned information technology, on any
server and/or storage device used to hold or transmit institutional data, or
any cloud-based server and/or storage device.
(%)Physical server. A dedicated physical computer on a network that is capable
of accepting requests from multiple university clients and providing
responses accordingly.
(&)Virtual server. A server created through the use of software known as a
hypervisor that allows a single physical computer to be partitioned intomultiple server computing units.($)Storage device.  A device used for recording and storing information (i.e.
institutional data).(')Network attached storage device. A computer connected to a network that
provides only Þle-based data storage services to other devices on the
network.

(()Firewall.  A part of a computer system or network that is designed to block
unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.
())Institutional data. All data created, collected, maintained, recorded or
managed by the university, its sta
!, and agents working on its behalf. Itincludes data used for planning, managing, operating, controlling, auditing
and reporting on university functions. When appropriate, institutional data
may also include research data that contains personally identiÞable subject
information, or proprietary university information.
(C)Scope. This policy applies to all student employees, faculty, sta
!, (collectivelyÒuniversity stakeholdersÓ) and third parties acting on behalf of Kent state university
as well as any other university a"liate authorized to access or is in possession of
Kent state university institutional data and IT resources.  This policy applies but is
not limited to all computer systems (applications, physical servers, virtual servers,and storage devices) that process or store university information.  The policy
applies both to computer systems that are run locally at Kent state university
campuses and those that are hosted or maintained by outside vendors. 
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the vice president for information
services and formally documented.  Exceptions will be reviewed on a periodic
basis and may be withdrawn at the discretion of the vice president for information
services.(D)Procedures.
(#)The division of information services (ÒISÓ or Òinformation servicesÓ) isresponsible for documenting the required security standards, updating on a
periodic basis, and posting to the IS website at www.kent.edu/is/security
(/is/security)
.(a)Such security standards as adopted and maintained by the division of
information services are intended to ensure adherence to the
standards set forth by existing laws and regulations, such as but not
limited to: Sections #$%&
.
#& and #%&
.
%$ of the Ohio Revised Code; theFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act; and the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act.

(%)Existing computer systems (applications, servers, and storage devices) will
be audited against the current standards.
(&)All new requests for computer systems (applications, servers, and storage
devices) must be reviewed by information services to ensure the proposed
system meets the security standards.
($)University stakeholders must receive prior approval from the division of
information services before utilizing externally managed services,
applications, and servers.(a)Vendors of externally managed services and applications shall be
required to complete the vendor security checklist prior to
engagement of such resources or transmission of institutional data.
Such checklists must be reviewed by IS.
(b)Service agreements and terms of use shall be submitted by the
requesting university stakeholder for review by information services
and other university stakeholders as required under rule 
$$%'-(-)%.
# ofthe Administrative Code.
(c)Any storage of institutional data with external service providers
requires the prior approval of information services.
(')Servers and network-attached storage devices operating on the Kent state
university network shall be secured according to the risk they pose to
institutional data, to critical univeristy processes, or to the ongoing
compliance of the university to state, federa, or other regulations.
(a)Servers and network-attached storage devices will be located in the
data center if they:(i)Contain sensitive personal identiÞable information (PII);(ii)Fall under state, federal, or other regulatory compliance
obligations;(iii)Directly integrate with other servers located in the data center;
(iv)Provide mission-critical functions to departmental faculty, sta

(b)Access to the data center shall be controlled by IS operations sta
!.(c)All data center devices shall reside behind IS-managed Þrewalls.
(d)Remote access shall be approved and managed by IS o
"ce of securityand access management.
(()All applications are subject to vulnerability assessments by IS.  In the event
of the identiÞcation of a critical vulnerability, IS shall require remediation in
order for the user and/or server/storage device to remain on the network.
())The use or storage of sensitive institutional data (including but not limited
to personally identiÞable information, or other information protected from
unauthorized disclosure by law, regulations or policy) on any server or
storage device for any purpose must adhere to the processes, standards, and
requirements as directed by IS o
"ce of security and access management.
(*)Domain names other than kent.edu acquired by university stakeholders for
the operation of applications must be obtained and registered through
information services.(!)Violations of this policy may result in suspension or loss of the userÕs access
to computing, storage, or network resources, with respect to institutional
data and university-owned information technology.
