Principles

The following principles address the general philosophy of the University 
of North Texas on computer use and security. These principles apply to and
 
are 
binding on all users of University computer resources:
 
A.
 
Authorized Use
: The University of North Texas provides computer resources for 
the purpose of accomplishing tasks related to the University's mission.
 
It should be noted that the use of some of the
 
computers, networks, and software 
located on or off the University campus may be dedicated to specific research, 
teaching missions or purposes that limit their use or access.
 
Students, including registered students as well as incoming students who have 
pa
id their fees, shall be allowed to use the University's computer resources for 
school
-
related and personal purposes, subject to this policy and other applicable

University policies; state and federal law; and as long as personal use does not 
result in any 
additional costs to the University. Graduating students will have their 
computer accounts terminated after the next long semester. Non
-
enrolled 
continuing students may retain their computer account(s) for up to twelve 
months.
 
An employee of the University 
shall be allowed to use computer resources in 
accordance with this and other applicable University policies. Incidental personal 
use of computer resources by employees is permitted, subject to review and 
reasonable restrictions by the employee's supervisor
; adherence to applicable 
University policies and state and federal law; and as long as such usage does not 
interfere with the employee's accomplishment of his or her job duties and does 
not result in any additional costs to the University. New employees s
hall gain 
immediate access to university computing resources upon the presentation of 
employment verification by the appropriate school, college, or department 
official. When an employee terminates employment for any reason other than 
retirement, his or he
r access to the University's computer resources will be 
terminated immediately unless specifically authorized by the Associate Vice 
President for Computing and Chief Technology Officer. Retired employees may 
retain access to computing services.
