Authentication establishes identity, while access permissions define the set of resources available to an 
individual who has been authenticated.  [Authentication is generally provided by the campus 
Enterprise Di
rectory 
Authentication Service
 
(EDAS)
, while access permissions are controlled by local systems administrators.  [For 
example,
 
the local administrator 
of a sensitive financial 
records system
 
may remove this access from an 
employee upon their retirement; 
however,
 
the same employee might retain access to general services such as

must regularly (not less than
 
annually
) document a review the

A
UTHENTICATION 
S
YSTEMS
 
The primary authentication mechanis
m for all Ball State University information systems is the 
Enterprise 
Directory Authentication Service
 
(EDAS).  [All Ball State University employees and studen
ts are eligible to receive 
a Ball State
 
Computer username
 
and password for this service.
 
Generally,
 
students receive these credentials 
dur
ing the admission process.  [E
mployees obtain them by visiting the 
Unified Technology Services (
UTS
)
 
Information Desk at BL101.  [Additional authentication systems apart from the 
E
DAS 
other
 
permitted methods 
d
escribed below.
 
 
a.
 
BSU Computer Username and Password
:  [Where practical and approved, all information systems 
requiring authentication of employees or students will use EDAS.  [This system provides standards based 
LDAP, Kerberos, 
Shibboleth, ADFS and 
NTLM authentication services employing strong encryption. The 
system is also built on a distributed 
model, which
 
is highly available, secure, and interoperable with 
existing and emerging technologies and complies with Technical Password R
equirements as des
cribed 
below.
 
Contact the Office of Information Security Services (OISS) for additional information before 
attempting to integrate with this authentication system, which requires certain technical protocols be 
followed to ensure security is maintained. 
 
 
b.
 
O
ther Permitted Authentication Systems
:  [Methods of authentication other than 
what is 
described above
 
should be avoided, but are sometimes necessary due to systems incompatibility or other reasons.  [Such 
systems must be approved by OISS prior to acquisition
, development, and deployment.  [These systems 
must comply with the Technical Passwor
d Requirements described below.
 
Purchased, developed, and 
acquired systems must be evaluated to include proper support for integration with EDAS.

P
ROCEDURES
 
 
a.
 
Responsibility
:  [
Each person is individually responsible for compliance with these procedures, and for 
keeping passwords secure by not sharing or treating them in a way others may discover them.  [
Suspected disclosure or 
compromise of a password to any other person must be immediately reported 
to OISS and the password changed.
 
 
b.
 
Password Distribution Procedures
:  [Initial usernames and passwords must be distributed in a manner 
so as to limit the number of people having oppor
tunity
 
to learn the initial password.
 
Username/password 
combinations distributed on paper shall be either handed directly to the account owner immediately 
upon printing (walk
-
up stations) or delivered to the account owner via envelope sealed at the point o
f 
origin and del
ivered through a secure method.
 
Passwords shall not be saved or archived by the issuing 
office in a recoverable format for any reason.  [Contact OISS for additional information concerning 
password distribution procedures. 
 
 
c.
 
Password Reset Pr
ocedures
:  [Password resets performed through walk
-
up procedures require that the 
account owner to appear in
-
person and to present valid government or university issued picture 
identification. 
Under no circumstances may passwords be reset and released
 
to an
yone but the account 
owner without approval of the Director of Information Security
 
Services
. 
Passwords may never be given 
out over telephone for any reason.  [Automated resets such as by pre
-
registration of alternate trusted 
addresses are permissible, as a

 
traveling outside of Indiana.

Such special procedures 
have
 
been 
approved 
by the
 
OISS and are described in

d.
 
Use of Assigned Usernames and Passwords
:  [Assigned usernames and passwords are only to be used 
on offici
al university managed systems. 
Passwords used to access Ball State University information 
systems may not be
 
transmitted to any information system or service outside the university 
unless 
approved by the D
irector of Information Security Services.
 
Many
 
services external to the university rely 
on successful EDAS authentication (
using a
 
certain zero 
knowledge authe
ntication method which does 
not disclose the password to the external party)
,
 
however
,
 
approval 
is required from OISS before 
implementation. 
 
 
e.
 
Sharing of Passwords
:  [Passwords are issued to individuals and must not be shared or transferred to 
any other per
son including
 
employee
s
, friend
s
, family member
s
, vendor
s
 
or external provider.  [No EDAS 
accounts shall be used as shared
-
password accounts.  [Departmental EDAS accounts are not intended 
for shared
-
password access; proxy access may be granted to any EDAS ac
count, which will provide the 
same functionality without the need for sharing passwords.
  [
Contact the Helpdesk or the OISS for more 
information.
 
 
f.
 
Password 
Disclosure 
f
or Support Purposes
:  [
No university employee is authorized to ask or demand the 
disclosure of a password
 
in the course
 
of providing support services.
 
If you are asked for your password, 
do not disclose it and report the incident to OISS.

ECHNICAL 
P
ASSWORD 
R
EQUIREMENTS
 
Passwords provide an important layer of information security.  [Selecting a strong password and keeping it 
confidential is an important part of securing Ball State University information assets.  [Although servers and 
systems will be configured to enforce th
ese standards as closely as 
possible,
 
the ultimate responsibility for 
compliance with these requirements and for maintaining the secrecy of passwords remains with the individual.
 
a.
 
Length
:  [Passwords may be
 
no less than twelve
 
characters in length.  [Longer p
asswords are preferred, 
as are so
-

ms not 
supporting at least twelve
 
character passwords shall be secured by some additional approved method 
providing enhanced security.  [Generally, 
longer passwords increase security as they are hard to guess.
 
b.
 
Complexity
:  [Passwords must contain a combination of at least three of the 
following groups of 
characters:
 
(1) upper case letters (2) lower case letters (3) numbers (4) special characters such a
s 
punctuation or symbols.  [Passwords may not contain the username or the proper name of the individual, 
nor may they contain information specifically identifiable to the account owner such as the nam
e of a 
pet, sibling, or spouse.
 
Password complexity enhan
ces security by reducing vulnerability to dictionary 
and related attacks.
 
c.
 
Expiration
:
 
 
All EDAS 
user account 
passwords will expire on an annual basis, thus requiring the owner to 
change the password at least once every 12 months.
 
 
The EDAS system will 
prevent users from setting 
their password to the last four passwords used previously when a password change is required. When 
an employee or student becomes
 
ineligible to have an active EDA
S account because of separation from 
the university or o
ther loss o
f eligibility, the E
D
A
S account will be disabled and all logins to the account 
disallowed as defined by automated rules tied to the student or employee record. EDAS accounts will 
be removed from the system using a two
-
stage process, with the accounts first
 
disabled (

then finally deleted permanently.

d.
 
Change Before Use
:  [Upon account creation or password reset procedures described 
above
, the account 
password must be changed
 
by the account owner before unless this function is not supported by t
he 
system
.  [
Requiring a password change before use helps insure that the active password is only known 
to the account owner.
 
e.
 
Authentication Failure Lockout
:  [
EDAS performs 
a temporary lockout after a 
consecutive
 
number of login 
attempt failures. This control is designed to prevent brute
-
force password guessing which normally 
involves attempting thousands or millions of password combinations. Account lockout should occur at 
a low number (less than 75) but more tha
n 20 
to
 
help prevent denial of service by a 
trivial
 
amount
 
of 
simple guessing. 
Temporary lockouts increase security by helping to make password guessing attacks 
infeasible. 
 
f.
 
Reporting of Password Failures
:  [Repeated failures to an account should result in 
an automatic 
EDAS 
warning message being generated and set to the account holder as well as a local systems administrator 
as well as directly to OISS.
 
g.
 
Passwords Not Stored in Unencrypted Format
:  [Systems shall not store pas
swords in an unencrypted 
format, a
nd an encrypted format which is recoverable is not permitted without authorization of the OISS.  [
In all cases where technically possible to do so, 
only a one
-
way hash of the password 
may be stored.
 
In 
no event may any system other than the Enterprise Direc
tory Authentication store 
the 
BSU Computer 
Username Passwords
; each authentication must be accomplished by a separate call to the 
authentication system or by 
an
 
issued ticket issued through this system.

Factor Authentication: 
Ball State has implemented
 
a two

requires the use of a physical device (such as a cell phone) in addition to the password when accessing 
certain production systems. Two
