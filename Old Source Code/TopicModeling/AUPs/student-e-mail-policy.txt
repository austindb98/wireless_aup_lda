Appropriate Use of Student E-mail Communication  ______________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ Approved by J. Stockwell 10/21/05 1 Office of the Chancellor Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to provide a clear explanation of the guidelines for appropriate communication to students using the University assigned student email over the University™s network.  This policy establishes regulations for the use of the University™s network to email mass messages to students. This policy applies to all wired, wireless, cellular, and emerging network technologies.  This policy was reviewed by the Chancellor™s Cabinet and approved by the Chancellor, and will be reviewed and updated as needed.  Definitions  User: The term ﬁuserﬂ refers to any person accessing the University network, including but not limited to, students, faculty, staff, contractors, clients, consultants, invited guests, and others working at the University.  Systems and Equipment: The term ﬁsystems and equipmentﬂ is defined as workstations, servers, printers, telephones, switches, routers, wiring hubs, wireless and cellular components, personal digital assistants (PDA™s), and other devices and software components that access the University network.  User Account: The term ﬁuser accountﬂ refers to the user identification, logon/login identification, or other system-specific means granted to a user permitting access to the University network.  Mass Message: The term ﬁmass messageﬂ (often called SPAM) refers to a message or communication that is sent/directed to a mass audience (i.e. faculty and staff, students).    Policy Statement  Access to the University network is provided in support of University activities. The guidelines for appropriate use of mass messages to all students via the user™s account are as follows:  1.  Student-wide electronic messages by e-mail should be reserved for rare and/or truly urgent emergency notices, such as safety or security alerts.  Authority to use the ﬁall studentsﬂ distribution lists rests with the Chancellor, Executive Vice Chancellor, Vice Chancellor for Student & Diversity Affairs or their designees. All other official University communication directed towards ﬁall students ﬁshould be disseminated using appropriate University student-focused publications and services (i.e. E-Blast, the online master event calendar, and the future online bulletin board).  2. Unauthorized network use for mass messages is not permitted.  Examples of inappropriate use include but are not limited to:  
Appropriate Use of Student E-mail Communication  ______________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ Approved by J. Stockwell 10/21/05 2 Office of the Chancellor  Duplicate, follow-up or reminder messaging regarding campus or community events or activities that have already been posted in E-blast or any another official publication for this purpose  Campus or community event or activity announcements that did not meet the deadline for other official publications  Changes or corrections to University publications such as the class schedule  General advertisement postings (i.e. sale of personal items)   Announcements of a personal nature   Personal, political or religious statements or dialogue   Chain letters, jokes, thank you messages, trivia contests, etc.   Any other message via e-mail to a group of persons not requesting the message   3. Other vice chancellors, deans, department and division heads may approve the creation and use of large subsets of the master list within the areas of their administrative responsibility for segmented student e-mail distribution, on either a standing or ad hoc basis, in accord with this policy.  Definitions and examples of segmented student e-mail distributions Segmented student e-mail distributions, whether to groups extracted from the central student database or assembled manually, can be considered in three broad categories:  A. Communications to involuntary standing lists that comprise specific, identifiable groups, such as course members, committees, and student organizations.  Except in unusual circumstances, recipients may not remove their names from such lists.   B. Communications to voluntary standing lists to which individuals subscribe and from which they may remove their address at any time.  Interest groups, service providers to students, extra-curricular organizations, and other groups that prefer to compile and maintain ﬁclientﬂ lists beyond their own membership should do so on a voluntary subscription basis.   C. Involuntary ad hoc communications of two sorts:  1. Messages with individualized content sent at the same time to a large number of recipients who do not form a continuing group, such as holders of overdue library
