 OverviewThis policy provides guidance and establishes expectations for members of the university community as
they use Ohio university's information technology resources.
Access to computer systems and networks owned or operated by Ohio university imposes certain
responsibilities and obligations and is granted subject to university policies, and local, state, and federal
statutes.
Access to the university's computing facilities and resources is granted solely to Ohio university faculty,
staff, registered students, and individuals outside the university who are authorized to use services that
have been made available through Ohio university. 
The university reserves the right to limit, restrict, or
extend computing privileges and access to its resources.
A.
Computers and network resources can provide access to resources both on and off campus. 
Such open
access is a privilege, and requires that individual users act in a responsible and acceptable manner.
Acceptable use always is ethical, reflects academic honesty, and shows restraint in the consumption of
shared resources. 
Acceptable use demonstrates respect for intellectual property, truth in
communication, ownership of data, system security mechanisms, and individuals' right to privacy and
freedom of intimidation, harassment, and unwarranted annoyance. 
The university considers any
violation of acceptable use principles or guidelines to be a serious offense and reserves the right to test
and monitor security, and copy and examine any files or information resident on university systems
allegedly related to unacceptable use.
Those who do not abide by the policies and guidelines in this policy should expect at least suspension of
computer privileges and possible disciplinary action in accordance with university rules for misconduct
and existing judicial, disciplinary, or personnel processes. 
Offenders may also be subject to criminal
prosecution under federal or state laws, and should expect the university to pursue such action.
The office of information technology should be notified about violations of computer laws and policies,
as well as about potential loopholes in the security of its computer systems and network. 
The user
community is expected to cooperate with the office of information technology in their operation of
computer systems and networks as well as in the investigation of misuse or abuse.
Ohio university's computers, networks, and other information resources (i.e., web pages and other
information servers) may not be used in any manner prohibited by law or disallowed by licenses,
contracts, or university regulations. 
Organizations, faculty, staff, and individuals are accountable for the
information they publish across computing resources, and they must be aware of university policies
regarding confidential information, harassment, use of university computer, and intellectual property.
