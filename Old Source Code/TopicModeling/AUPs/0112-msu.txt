of faculty, students, staff, and others.  [This policy addresses the responsibilities of the University and of all users of these information technology (IT) resources. 
POLICY All users are required to use University IT resources in an effective, efficien
t, ethical, and lawful manner. Use of Mississippi State University's IT
 resources must be consistent with the mission 
of the University and all applicable laws and policies.

Each user is responsible for ma
intaining the security of electronically stored information, as 
specified in the University™s Information Security Policy, 
OP 01.10, and associated Information 
Security Program.  [Such responsibil
ities include, but are not limited to: 
 Accounts, passwords, and other types of authorization are assigned to individual users and must not be shared with others. 
 Each user should be aware of computer viru
ses and other malicious computer programs

Digital and Electronic C
opyright Infringement: 
The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 34 
CFR Section 668 requires universities which receive federal student aid funds to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material.  [MSU is committed to an 
aggressive plan of education, deterrence, and 
remediation to protect MSU students, faculty, an
d staff, as well as the rights of copyright holders.  [All users of University IT resources must understand that copying, using, downloading, 
uploading, sharing, or otherwise distributing copyrighted material (includi
ng, but not limited to, 
music, movies, books, articles, and computer so
ftware) without explicit permission of the 
copyright owner or agent or as allowed by OP 01.20 (Policy on Use of Copyrighted Works for 
Education and Research) is a violation of federal law and MSU policy.  [ ﬁIllegal downloadﬂ refers to the 
inappropriate electronic transfer of a copyrighted material from 
one computer to another across a network; ﬁPeer to
 Peer file sharingﬂ means using a particular 
type of software designed to share electronic files or resources between two or more computers 
across a network.  [Peer to Peer (P2P) software such as BitTorrent, LimeWire, and Kazaa is often 
used to facilitate illegal downloads and file sharing.  [The Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Associatio
n of America (MPAA), the Business Software 
Alliance (BSA), and other such groups aggressive
ly seek out potential copyright infringements 
perpetrated by users of P2P software, and they aggressively pursue violators.  [RIAA and MPAA both maintain lists of legal alternatives to
 illegal downloading on their web sites at http://www.riaa.com/
 and http://www.mpaa.org/
.  [MSU maintains additional information 
regarding legal download alternatives at 
http://filesharing.msstate.edu/

users Privacy 
OP 01.25 (Privacy of Electronic Information) defi
nes the balance between the University™s 
responsibilities and users™ expectations of privacy when using IT resources owned or provided by MSU.  [
Academic Freedom 
Free expression of ideas is central to the academic
 process. However, the 
University may remove 
any electronic information from its systems if it is determined that: 
a. The presence of the information involves i
llegality (e.g., copyrighted material shared 
inappropriately and software used in violation of a license agreement). 
b. The information in some way endangers IT re
sources or the information of other users 
(e.g., a computer worm, virus, or other destructive program). 
c. The information is inappropriate because it
 is inconsistent with the mission of the 
University or is otherwise not in complianc
e with the legal and ethical usage governed by Federal or State law or regulation or with University or Board of Trustees policies. d. The cost of maintaining the information 
is deemed prohibitive by the responsible 
administrative unit. 
e. The owner of the information is no longer authorized for access to University resources. Employee Personal Use 
Employees of the University are permitted incidental personal use of MSU IT resources, subject 
to review and reasonable restrictions by the employee™s supervisor; adherence to applicable University policies and state and federal law; and as long as such usage does not interfere with 
the employee™s accomplishment of his or her job 
duties and does not result in any additional costs to the University (See 
OP 01.19, Misuse of University Assets
).  [
Student Personal Use Students of the University are permitted personal use of MSU IT resources, subject to review and 
restrictions as defined by law and University policy including OP 91.100 (Code of Student Conduct). Sanctions and Appeals Under federal law first-time offenders who co
mmit copyright violations can face criminal 
penalties of as much as five years in prison 
and/or $250,000 in fines; they may also be sued by 
the copyright holder in civil court, potentially 
resulting in additional monetary damages and legal 
fees.  [Other illegal acts involving use of MSU™s IT resources by any person may also be subject 
to prosecution by state and federal officials.  [ 
Anyone found to be in violation of this policy may lose access privileges to the University™s IT environment, and MSU students, faculty, and staff 
are subject to University disciplinary policies 
and procedures, including:  [OP 01.10 Information Security Policy
