BACKGROUND:
 
 

 
inappropriate transfer, sale, or disposal of CMU
-
owned computers, computer
-
based equipment, and digital
 
media of any kind.  Without 
proper removal, s
ens
itive personal data as well as U
niversity licensed software packages may 
inadvertently 
remain on the hard drives or 
storage media
 
of computers and other equipment intended for transfer, sale, or disposal
.
 
 
A
t best, a
ccess to this sens
itive information and 
licensed U
niversity software by non
-
authorized 
personnel (internal or external to CMU)
 
is inappropriate. 
 
At worst
, the 
U
niversity could be 
held liable for the release of personal information and/or a
 
violat
ion of software licensing 
agreements. This
 
policy
 
guards against 
these 
possibilities
 
by requiring 
that all computers and other digital assets intended for transfer, sale, and disposal be managed 
through 
processes 
maintained by 
University Stores 
and 
the Off
ice of Information Technology
 
(OIT)
.
  
 
POLICY:
 
 
The Office of Information Technology and University Stores will jointly maintain procedures for the appropriate removal of CM
U data 
from all computers and other digital assets prior to their transfer to another department within CMU, public sale, or dispos
al.  The 
equipment covered under this policy is intended to be inclusive of a wide range of University
-
owned computers, computer
-
based 
equipment and 
storage media 
of all kinds, including both portable and
 
removable media
.  
 
 
PROCEDURE:
 
 
All computers and digital assets must be transferred to OIT or University Stores for erasure prior to transfer, sale, or disp
osal.  
Erasure 
of 
data must be confirmed as successful,
 
or the storage media will be
 
considered defective and must be destroyed (crushed, shredded, or 
rendered otherwise unusable) before 
the remaining equipment may be transferred, sold, or disposed of
.
 
 
If defective stor
age media cannot 
be separated from the device, the device must be destroyed before leaving the University.
 
 
University
-
owned computers and other digital assets known to have housed Restricted or otherwise regulated information (l
ike 
workstations or devices
 
used in clinical patient treatment areas, servers and server
-
storage with large repositories or databases of HIPAA, 
FERPA, or controlled resear
ch data on them) will be considered to be at high risk for inadvertent data loss and will have their storage 
med
ia removed and destroyed by OIT/University Stores prior to transfer, sale, or disposal of the equipment.
