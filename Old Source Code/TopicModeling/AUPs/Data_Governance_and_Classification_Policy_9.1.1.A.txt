 Data Classification 
and Data Types
   Data Classification and Data Types
  The university utilizes v
arious
 data 
types
. Data types with similar 
levels of 
risk 
sensitivity
 are grouped together
 into data classifications.
 Four 
data classifications
 are 
used by the university
: Export Controlled
, Restricted
, Controlled
 and 
Public
. The 
Data T
rustee is ultimately responsible for deciding how to classify their data 
(see 
Roles and Responsibilities
 for list of D
ata Truste
es and additional information
).   On a periodic basis, it is important to re
-evaluate the classification of university data 
to ensure the assigned classification is still appropriate based on changes to legal 
and contractual obligations as well as changes 
in the use of the data or its value to 
the uni
versity. This evaluation must 
be conducted by the appropriate Data Trustee.
 Conducting an evaluation on an annual basis is 
recommend
ed; 
however, the Data 
Trustee must
 determine 
the 
frequency
 that
 is most appropriate based on
 need.
 If a 
Data Trustee determines that the classification of a certain data set has changed, an 
anal
ysis of security controls must
 be performed to determine whether existing 
controls are consistent with the new classification
. If gaps are found in existin
g security controls, they must
 be corrected in a timely manner, commensurate with 
the level of risk presented by the gaps.
 If you have any questions related to 
classification of data, please contact the IT@UC Office of Informa
tion Security (OIS) 
at 
513-558-ISEC (4732)
 or 
 infosec@uc.edu
.  Data Types
  The University of Cincinnati has defined four 
Data Types and created a data 
classification for each university data: 
Export Controlled
, Restricted
, Controlled 
and 
Public
. The following sections will define these data and provide examples of 
each type:
  Export
 Control
led  As a means to promote national security, the U.S. Government controls export of 
sensitive 
data, 
equipment, software and technology. This data is labeled Export 
Controlled. Trustees, Stewards, Custodians and Users of Export Controlled data must 
follow
 all safeguards for Restricted data plus additional safeguards as directed by 
the 
Export Controls Office

identify appropriate additional
 safeguards.
  The following table contains examples of
 Export Controlled data.

a list of common examples and 
not an exhaustive listing.

controlled under the Atomic Energy Act and regulations therein.
   Ł Proprietary or 3rd Party information not in the

determination is complete.
  Restr
icted
   Data is classified as Restricted when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or 
destruction of that data could cause a 
significant level of risk to the university or its 
affiliates. Users of Restricted data must follow all safeguards for Controlled data 
plus additional safeguards identified for Restricted data. High levels of security 
safeguards must be applied to Restrict
ed data.
