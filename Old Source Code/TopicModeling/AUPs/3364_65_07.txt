All universityusers will adhere to this policy and associated standards where passwords are used.(1) Password standards will be based upon the results of risk assessments in accordancewith The University of Toledo's "Information Security Framework." The standardwill comprise a combination of password factors: length, composition, aging, lockoutand history. The combination of these factors affect the level of security associatedwith a password, Where feasible, the University's minimum password factors forsystems requiring secured access are as follows:(a) Password length: a minimum of eight characters
3364-65-07 Password security policy                                          2(b) Password composition: contains a combination of alpha, numeric, specialcharacters and case (upper/lower)(c) Password aging: a maximum password life of 180 days(d) Password history: a password cannot be reused within 10 iterations.Alternatively, a period of one year can be established before a password canbe reused.(e) Password lock-out: a security action is taken after five invalid passwordattemptsr-(2) System lockout reset. Commensurate with the risk assessment of the system assets,organizations shall establish a policy on the method of reinstating a user accountsubject to system lockout. For systems having higher risk assets, users with asuspended account shall be re-authenticated before access is reactivated. For systemshaving lower risk assets, a reset feature may be used before the account isautomatically reactivated, such as having a predetermined time lapse or prompting theuser to provide a piece of additional information that only he or she would know.(3)Uniqueness. When secured access is used, the combination of user ID and personalpassword shall authenticate a unique user. A user account for a university controlledsystem will be associated with a single individual and shall not be established for useby more than one person.(4)Storage. System password files shall be maintained and safeguarded in a manner toprevent unauthorized access. Password files will be backed up to facilitate recoveryfrom system failures, security breaches, disasters, accidents and like events with thepotential to affect systems. Passwords within those files shall be stored in a one-wayencrypted or hashed form and not in plain text.(5)Transmission. Electronic transmission of passwords from one destination to anothershall be protected fi'om unauthorized access at a level conv-nensurate with the riskassessment of the system asset. Encryption of these credentials is expected.(6)Deactivated accounts. Accounts of employees, contractors, temporary personnel andother agents of the university who have terminated or transfen'ed to other work unitsshall be deactivated. Accounts will be deactivated for such users no later than the endof business on the effective date. Accounts associated with involuntary terminationsshall be deactivated immediately upon notification. The user's account may bemaintained in the authentication database until all files owned by the user have beenhandled appropriately; at that time the user account should be deleted.(7)Compromised accounts. Accounts compromised maliciously or by accident shall bedeactivated immediately. All instances of maliciously compromised accounts shallbe reported immediately in accordance with the university's security incidentreporting procedures.c(8)Save password option. Organizations shall avoid system and applicationconfigurations that allow the use of save password options, except where pass-

If a system's "save password" feature cannot be disabled, users shallbe instructed not to use that option.(9) Administrative accounts(a) Services and systems using system accounts and passwords or user accounts(such as administrative accounts) that have elevated access to administrativelevel services shall be identified and procedures developed to restrict or logtheir activities. Organizations shall ensure that administrators of such systemsare both aware of the procedures and trained on the appropriate use of suchaccounts.(b)Administrator groups shall be established and only authorized personnel shallbe assigned to these groups. All other users shall be restricted from accessingadministrator accounts. Review of the membership of these groups will beconducted semi-annually at a minimum.(c)Only authorized personnel should be issued administrative accounts. Thosewith authorized administrative accounts shall use separate user accounts fornon-system administrator tasks.(12)(10)(11)Display. Passwords shall be hidden from display at all times.Password management. University organizations shall ensure that the managementof passwords maintains confidentiality, integrity and availability. Accounts shall bepermitted only for authorized users pursuant to The University of Toledo"Information Security Framework Policy."Education and awareness. Organizations shall establish password managementeducation and awareness efforts in accordance with university policy for "SecurityEducation and Awareness." At a minimum, organizations shall ensure the followingis addressed:(13)(a) Password protection is the responsibility of each user.(b) Personal information such as social security number, meaningful dates,niclcnames or other obvious information shall not constitute a password.(c) A review of university policies on password composition.Password testing. Information Technology Security personnel shall configuresystems to test password effectiveness regularly if that capability is available.Password testing should be conducted by authorized personnel only and shouldoccur at least annually. Password testing should be conducted more frequently ifdeemed necessary by the risk assessment defined in The University of Toledo's"Information Security Framework."
3364-65-07 Password security policy                                          4(14)Default passwords. Default application and system passwords shall be reset beforedeployment of any system or application. This requirement shall apply not only toconventional desktops, servers and notebook computers, but also to passwords forembedded systems, including network routers, switches and some networkableprinters.(15) Exceptions Approval. Any exceptions to these standards must be approved by theinfolÿnation security office in infolanation technology.(4)(6)(7)(8)(9)(5)(3)(E)Definitions:(1)  Password aging. The period of time after which a password is no longer consideredsecure. Typically, the older the password, the less secure it is.(2)  Password composition. The types of characters, such as upper and lower caseletters, numbers and special characters that comprise a password.Password history. Passwords shall have a re-use period commensurate with the riskassessment of the system assets being protected.Password length. The mlmber of characters in a password. The longer thepassword, the more secure it is.Risk assessment. A process concerned with identifying, analyzing and respondingto information teclmology security risks. Risk assessment attempts to maximize theresults of positive events and minimize the results of negative events. See theUniversity of Toledo "InfolTnation Security Framework" for assessment guidelines.Save password option. An option on some systems that, when enabled, allows theuser the choice of whether to have the user password memorized by the system sothat it will not need to be le-entered upon subsequent access.Source. An entity that can create or select a valid password.System assets. Information, hardware, software and services required to support thebusiness of the organization, and identified during the risk assessment process asassets that need to be protected in accordance with The University of Toledo"Information Security Framework."System_lockout. A maximum number of allowed password attempts commensuratewith the risk assessment of the system assets. Upon exceeding the prescribednumber of unsuccessful attempts, the user account or tern'final activity shall besuspended.
