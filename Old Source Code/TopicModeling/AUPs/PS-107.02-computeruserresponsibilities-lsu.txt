Eligibility
 
 
In
 
general,
 
access
 
to
 
computing
 
resources
 
is
 
provided
 
to
 
the
 
following groups:
 
 

 
Active
 
faculty,
 
staff,
 
and
 
students
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
University
 
operations
 
and
 
initiatives.
 
The
 
eligibility
 
of
 
these
 
individuals
 
to
 
access
 
computing
 
resources
 
may
 
be
 
tested
 
automatically
 
and
 
periodically
 
against
 
University
 
records.
 
Other
 
sources
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
where
 
these
 
databases
 
do
 
not
 
accurately
 
reflect 
an
 
ongoing 
affiliation.
 

 
Persons
 
not
 
affiliated
 
with
 
LSU
 
engaged
 
in
 
research
 
or
 
support
 
of
 
University
 
operations
 
or
 
University
 
supported
 
initiatives.
 
The
 
eligibility
 
of
 
these
 
individuals
 
to
 
access
 
computing
 
resources
 
and/or
 
data
 
requires
 
initial
 
and
 
periodic
 
verification
 
of
 
need
 
 
by 
 
a 
 
Dean,
 
 
Department
 
 
Head,
 
 
or
 
Director.
 
Requests
 
must
 
be
 
accompanied
 
by
 
the
 
reason
 
for
 
the
 
access,
 
the
 
name
 
and
 
contact
 
information
 
of
 
the
 
sponsoring
 
Dean,
 
Department
 
Head,
 
or 
Director,
 
and
 
the
 
length
 
of
 
time
 
for 
which
 
the
 
access
 
will
 
be 
required.
 

 
Access
 
to
 
computing
 
resources
 
by
 
retired
 
faculty
 
and
 
staff
 
is
 
a
 
recognized
 
benefit
 
to
 
the
 
University
 
community
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
providing
 
these
 
resources
 
is
 
economical
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
adversely
 
affect
 
the
 
 
operations
 
 
of
 
 
the
 
University.
 
This
 
statement
 
applies
 
primarily
 
to
 
electronic
 
mail
 
and
 
general
 
purpose
 
academic
 
or
 
research
 
systems.
 
In
 
the
 
event
 
that
 
resources
 
become
 
constrained,
 
this
 
practice
 
may
 
be
 
eliminated
 
or
 
restricted.
 
However,
 
the
 
University,
 
in
 
its
 
sole
 
discretion,
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
may
 
limit,
 
withdraw,
 
or
 
deny
 
access 
to
 
retired
 
faculty
 
and 
staff.
 
 
NOTE:
 
Colleges,
 
departments,
 
and
 
other
 
administrative
 
units
 
may
 
issue
 
local
 
technology
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures
 
that
 
support
 
their
 
organizational
 
missions
 
and
 
requirements.
 
Such
 
policies
 
may
 
be
 
more
 
restrictive
 
than
 
University
 
policy,
 
but
 
CAN
 
NOT
 
be
 
more
 
permissive.
 
All
 
local
