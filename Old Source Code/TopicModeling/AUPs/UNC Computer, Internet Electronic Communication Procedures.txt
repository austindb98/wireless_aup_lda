Privacy & Security

Users should not have an expectation of privacy for communications on the University
network. Con
#
dentiality of email, voicemail and other network transmissions cannot 
beassured. Therefore all users should exercise extreme caution when committing con
#
dential
information to electronic media.
Under the Colorado Open Records Act, electronic 
#
les are treated in much the same 
way aspaper 
#
les. Any o
"
cial university documents (as de
#
ned by law) in the 
#
les 
of employees of
the State of Colorado are considered to be public documents, and may 
be subject to
inspection through the Open Records Act. In such cases, the Legal Counsel 
to the Board of
Trustees should inspect the contents of the applicable 
#
les to determine 
which portions
may be exempt from disclosure. Any inspection of electronic 
#
les, 
and any action based
upon such inspection will be governed by all applicable U.S. 
and Colorado laws and by
university policy.
Certain central service and network activities from workstations connected to the 
network
are routinely logged and monitored. These activities include:
Use of passwords and accounts accessed
Time and duration of network activity
Access to web pages
Access to network software
Volume of data storage and transfers
Server space used for data and email
In case of suspected violations of UNC procedures, especially unauthorized access 
tocomputing systems, the system administrator may authorize detailed session logging. 
Thismay involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition the system
administrator may authorize limited searching of user 
#
les to gather evidence on 
asuspected violation.
Users must protect and backup critical data. UNC Information Technology is not obligated
to maintain backups of any 
#
le for any particular length of time. Individual users 
anddepartments should develop policies and practices to ensure regular backups of 
data and
implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current 
generations of
computing equipment and storage media and media readers.
All UNC department should implement policies to ensure that access to sensitive data 
isrestricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords
restricting access to information should be changed on a regular basis and systems 
should
be developed and implemented to assure password records are regularly updated 
by
appropriate supervisors
University owned computer and equipment might be examined to detect unauthorized
software 
use and to evaluate the security of the network
Default or issued passwords, such as those from a manufacturer, should be immediately
changed
