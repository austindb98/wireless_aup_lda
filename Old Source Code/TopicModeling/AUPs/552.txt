   POLICY MANUAL  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
  Number 552 Subject: Wireless Network Deployment & Access Effective Date: February 1, 2008
  552.1  PURPOSE Wireless network technologies play an increasingly important role at Utah State 
University. The purpose of this policy is to establish the intent, direction, and expectation with respect to the deployment (including 
installation, operation, and maintenance) of 
wireless technology at Utah State University. USU Informa
tion Technology (IT) is taking on the initiative to provide 100% wireless coverage for the institution. 552.2  POLICY Information Technology shall design, deploy, ma
nage, and coordinate a secure wireless networking service for the University. This 
wireless system will allow faculty, staff, 
students, and sponsored guests at USU ready-access to the internet and USU infrastructure, where authorized, 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, except when system 
maintenance is required. 
Wireless access points deployed by others which 
create radio frequency interference with 
this wireless service or duplicate existing wi
reless services will be disconnected from the 
network to avoid security breaches and other IT operation problems. Separate 
deployments for research evaluation or traini
ng needs should be coordinated with IT to avoid interference and duplication. IT shall have the sole charge and responsibility for the Un
iversityâ„¢s wireless networking system including establishing procedures
 for use at USU and adopting standards consistent with current 
industry best practices.
