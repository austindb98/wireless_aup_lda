  Number 554 Subject: Banner Identification Number Effective Date: February 1, 2008
  554.1  PURPOSE It is the intention of this policy to recognize that Banner 
identification (ID) numbers will 
be treated as public identifiers, rather than
 Social Security Numbers, with appropriate 
office practices which recognize the non-confidential status of the Banner ID number.  
554.2  POLICY Banner ID numbers are unique, public identif
iers for members of the Utah State 
University community to be used by the offi
cial system-of-record and for other purposes 
where it is important to distinguish among similarly named members of the USU 
community. Because of their public nature, Banner ID numbers do not constitute proof of 

identity.     BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
