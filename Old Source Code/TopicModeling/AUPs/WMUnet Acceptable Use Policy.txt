WMUnet Acceptable Use Policy
PURPOSEThis policy sets forth the regulations for the use of Western Michigan
University's network, known as WMUnet.
SCOPE
This policy applies to everyone using network services of Western Michigan
University, whether on campus, at regional sites, or remotely through other
internet service providers.
POLICY STATEMENTS
Network services and wiring may not be modified or extended beyond the
area of their intended use. This applies to all network wiring, hardware,
and jacks.
The network may not be used to provide Internet access to anyone outside
of the University community for any purposes. WMU-specific or
commercially obtained network resources may not be retransmitted
outside of the University community.
The network is a shared resource. Thus, network use or applications which
inhibit or interfere with the use of the network by others are not permitted.
(For example, using an IP address not registered to you, or applications
which use an unusually high portion of the bandwidth for extended periods
of time, thus inhibiting the use of the network by others, are not
permitted). Use of the network must comply with all University's policies.
Forgery or other misrepresentation of one's identity via electronic or any
other form of communication is a violation. Prosecution under State and
Federal laws may also apply.O!ice of Information Technology
