  Infrastructure as a 
Service,
 Platform as a Service 
and Software as a Service 
offer
 a number o

, and quick deliver

Infrastructure as a 
Service (I
aaS)
 refers to
 solutions that provide services such as 
storage, virtual server hosting, networking
, or other infrastructure components via 
the 
internet.
 IaaS offers 
many 
advantages, 
including
 scalability
 based on resource
 demand
s.  
Platform as a S
ervice
 (PaaS)
 allows customers to develop, run
, and manage 
applica
tions without 
building and 
maintaining 
infrastructure.
 PaaS provides 
methods
 to intera
ct with services like databases
 and file storage, withou
t having to deal with 
low
 level requirements.
  
Software as a Service 
(SaaS)
 is a software licensing and delivery model in which 
software is licensed to
 or on behalf of
 the university and is hosted by the vendor, 
typically the university accesses the application via a web browse

  This policy addresses the use of IaaS, PaaS
, and SaaS for university enterprise 
purposes where the service essentially becomes an extension of the university 
network.

strategy for disengaging from the vendor or service
, and integrating the service into 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The university must determine how 
data would be recovered from the vendor and/or transferred to a different vendor. 

The university must also work with the vendor to establis

sanitization from the vendor™s services.

Œ Appendix A
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as 
a Service (SaaS) 
all aim to shift the local hosting and management of IT 
Services 

from on
-site to the cloud. The combination of these services is known as the Cloud 
Services Stack, and each service fulfills its own role in replacing an on
-site solution 
with a cloud based o
ne.
  
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 refers to the fundamental building blocks of 
Cloud Services. IaaS offers an alternative to locally owned and hosted servers, and 

users of an IaaS service can build a ﬁvirtual datacenterﬂ that has access to many of 

the same resources as a traditional datac
enter without the large upfront investment 
and space constraints. IaaS is the ﬁlowest levelﬂ of the Cloud Services stack, and acts 
as the ﬁfoundationﬂ for all the other segments of cloud services. Examples of IaaS 
would include Amazon Web Services (AWS), M
icrosoft Azure, and Google Cloud 
Platform (GCP).
  Platform as a S
ervice (PaaS)
 is one level above IaaS in the Cloud Services stack. A 
PaaS solution would provide the environment for which the service or program will 
run, such as the operating system and al
l necessary software. PaaS is built on top of 
virtualization technology, which enables efficient hosting and on
-demand scaling. 
IaaS is strictly concerned with hardware and storage devices and PaaS consists of 
virtual machines that are already loaded with 
all necessary operating systems and 
supporting software. Some examples of PaaS include Cloud Foundry, Google App 
Engine, and Microsoft Azure.
  Software as a Service (SaaS)
 is the highest level of the Cloud Services stack and 
includes pre
-packaged software 
that the University licenses directly from a vendor. 
Typically
, the university accesses the application via a web browser.
 SaaS is the 
highest level of the Cloud Services stack, and moves the task of managing and 
deploying software to a third
-party service
. Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, 
Google Docs, and cloud storage portals like Box or Dropbox. Using SaaS means the 
customer is not responsible for hosting, updating, or troubleshooting the software, 

as it is supplied, ready
-for
-use, by the vendor.
