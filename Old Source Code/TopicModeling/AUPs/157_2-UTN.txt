Principles:
 
The University has chosen to adopt the policy principles established in the National 
Institute of Standards (NIST) 800 series of publicati
ons, and this policy is based on 
those guidelines.
 
The Chancellor or equivalent at each Campus must designate an individual or functional 
position responsible for information security at their Campus (Position of Authority 
and/or Campus Authority). The 
individual or position should be at a high enough 
organizational level to allow him/her to speak with authority on and for the Campus.
 
Each Campus must develop or adopt and adhere to a program which demonstrates 
compliance with this policy and related stan
dards. This program is the responsibility of 
the Position of Authority.
 
A Campus may apply more stringent requirements than those documented in this policy 
provided they do not conflict with or lower the standards or requirements established by 
this or any
 
other University policy.
 
Each User of University resources is required to be familiar and comply with University 
policies. Acceptance of this policy is assumed if a User accesses, uses, or handles 
University resources.
 
Policy:
 
1.
 
User Privacy 
 
a.
 
There should b
e no expectation of privacy on the part of the User.
 
b.
 
As required by state law, the University hereby notifies users that email

Tennessee Open Records Act, unless the email is covered by an 
exce
ption to the Act, such as personally identifiable student information, 
proprietary information, or trade secrets (See UT Information 
Classification Policy: IT 0115, sections two and three).
