followed:
 
 

 
Never arrange a meeting alone with someone you have made contact with on the internet
 

 
Never disclose any personal in
formation through the internet to unknown persons or 
organisations

Use of Portable data storage devices (memory sticks, etc.)
 
 
You 
are encou

storage such as your college OneDrive account instead. Portable storage devices regularly fail 
and can be lost and should only ever be used to backup files that you have stored 
elsewhere. If 
you insist on using portable storage devices then:
 
 

 
Do not store personal data (any data which would be convered by the data protection act).
 

 
You are responsible for the information and data held on your USB memory devices.
