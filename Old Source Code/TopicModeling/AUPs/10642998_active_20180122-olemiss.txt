!!!1!IT APPROPRIATE USE POLICY
 Summary/Purpose:
 This policy sets forth the privileges of and restrictions on students, faculty, 
staff, and other users with respect to the computing and telecommunications systems 
offered by
 the University of Mississippi
 (UM
). This 
is not limited to desktop/laptop 
system
s, hand
-held
/mobile
 computers, lab facilities, centralized servers, classroom technology, the wired and 
wireless campus networks, 
cloud
-based services, 
etc. This policy define
s and give
s examples of 
various sorts of activities which are detrimental to the welfare of the overall community and 
which are therefore prohibited. It also describes the process by which violators are identified, 
investigated, and disciplined. It should 
be noted that 
certain legal 
activities are in violation of this 
policy and are prohibited with respect to University computing and network systems. This policy 
is designed to protect the University community from illegal or damaging actions by individuals,
 either knowingly or unknowingly. Inappropriate use exposes the University to risks
, including 
virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services
, legal 
issues, and possible financial 
penalties
. This policy directly addresses copyright issues relate
d to illegal downloads
 and 
peer
-to-peer
 file sharing. 
 PLEDGE TO STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STAFF The University of Mississippi is committed to maintaining its leadership position in the use of 
computer and communication technolog
ies to facilitate learning. The University promises to 
provide, as rapidly and as economically as is feasible, the following: 
 ¥!to students,
 access to their information anywhere on campus. 
 ¥!to faculty,
 the resources necessary to enhance teaching, learning and 
research. 
 ¥!to staff,
 the tools necessary for a responsive service environment. 
 The University will normally respect privacy and attempt to safeguard information but cannot 
guarantee these privileges absolutely: 
the University can examine, at any time, any
thing that 
is stored on or transmitted by University
-owned equipment.
  [The University reserves the right to limit access to its networks when applicable university 
policies or codes, contractual obligations, or state or federal laws are violated but does n
ot 
monitor or generally restrict the content of material transported across those networks. 
 The University reserves the right to remove or limit access to material posted on 
university
-owned computers when applicable university policies or codes, contractual obligations, or state 
or federal laws are violated, but does not monitor the content of material posted on university
-owned computers. 
 RESPONSIBLE USE OF 
EMAIL
 AND OTHER E
LECTRONIC COLLABORATION 
MEDIUMS
  [UM recognizes the utilization of electronic communications as an efficient and necessary 
method of conducting business and advanc
ing its mission of creating and disseminating
 knowledge. 
 Electronic mail (
email) and electron
ic collaboration tool
s should be used with the 
same care and discretion as any other type of official university communication
.  [ 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!2!Principal Priorities of 
Email: 1.!Official 
UM email correspondence 
must originate from
 a UM email account
 on the UM 
Mail (
Office
 365) server
s or a registered, on
-campus
, or cloud based
 departmental
 email server.
  [Exceptions include email to support instructional activities, which may originate 
from UM Gmail, and extenuating circumstances where access to UM email a
ccounts is 
limited.  [ 2.!Official UM email correspondence must be concise, professional, and free of personal 
expressions inappropriate for a business or academic environment.
 3.!Email communications must not be unethical, fraudulent, harassing, obscene, or 
perceived to be a confl
ict of interest or contain sensitive/confidential information (i.e. 
credit card numbers, 
social security numbers, etc.) as defined by the IT Security Policy.
 4.!File attachments sent via email must be scanned using current anti
-virus software prior to 
sending
 the transmission. Any file attachment that is received must be scanned prior to 
opening the file.  [
 5.!Users must not allow anyone else to send email using their accounts.
  [UNIVERSITY
-OWNED
 computer and network resources, including Internet connections and 
bandwidth, exist to advance the mission of the University. The University will manage these 
resources accordingly. Technologies such as Internet2 are provided for specific purposes. The 
primary goals of Internet2 are to create a 
leading
-edge
 network capability for the national 
research community, to enable revolutionary Internet applications, and to ensure the rapid 
transfer of new network services and applications to the broader Internet co
mmunity (see 
internet2.edu). The University authorizes the IT
 department
 to create and enforce appropriate 
management policies that are supportive of the goals of these technologies.
 Examples
: The University reserves the right to send official notices to a
ll student/faculty/staff email accounts. Campus webmasters should use discretion when 
linking to non
-University websites. You may not install software on University
-owned 
computers that interferes with day
-to-day work or hinders the professional operation 
of University computers or networks. You may not set up a networked server on campus 
that results in the monopolization of network bandwidth or interferes with access to 
online academic resources. 
 University resources include technology provided to the un
iversity and owned/operated by a 
third 
party
 (cellphones, cellular hotspots, etc.) the use
rs of which must adhere to university 
policies.
  [Technology provided to you by the University is for completing work efficiently and effectively 
and should not be shar
ed except for university
-related purposes.
  [ Any personal use, intentional 
or unintentional, that incurs a cost to the University must be reimbursed. 
 Visitors to the university may use wired and wireless networks and technology configured for 
public access as long as they follow this IT Appropriate Use Policy.
  [ University employees may 
authorize their guests to use the wireless network.
  [In these insta
nces, the employee who 
authorizes the access is responsible for the actions of the guest. 
 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!3!Individual departments may place additional restrictions on personal use of the resources by their 
employees.
 YOU MAY NOT
 use personal email accounts 
to conduct 
official UM
 business. 
 Examples
: Personal email accounts include, but are not limited to, accounts such as 
username@gmail.com, 
username@hotmail.
com
, username@yahoo.com
, etc. The University recognizes that there may be extenuating circumstances where 
communication is 
required but access to UM email accounts is limited, e.g., emergencies.  [In these cases, 
employees are encouraged to be resourceful in accomplishing
 their work and
 always
 mindful of 
related security issues. 
 PROVISIONS You are entitled onl
y to one person's fair share of University resources unless written permission 
to the contrary has been granted by the Chief Information Officer (CIO). See 
http://www.
olemiss.edu/depts/it/policy/
 for oth
er technology
-related policies.
 The 
following list includes
 examples of prohibited 
activities
, and is
 not 
inclusive of
 everything
 that is a violation:
 YOU MAY NOT
 use
 the University computing or telecommunications systems to violate 
copyright law.  [Copyright law limits the right of a user to copy, download, distribute, edit, or 
transmit electronically another's intellectual property, including written materials, images
, videos, software, games, sounds, music, and performances, even in an educational context 
without permission. Violations of copyright law may include giving others unauthorized access 
to copyrighted materials by posting that material on social networking 
sites, downloading from 
Internet websites or through peer
-to-peer (P2P) file sharing any material owned by another 
without the ownerÕs permission, or sharing files that include copyrighted material with others 
through peer
-to-peer software or networks.  [Pe
er-to-peer is a method of file sharing that allows 
normal users ("peers") to connect directly to other users to share files. This can be contrasted 
with a server
-based distribution method, where users connect to a server (such as a web server 
via 
their b
rowser) to download files. If you have P2P file
-sharing applications installed on your 
computer, you may be sharing copyrighted works without even realizing it. Even if you do not 
intend to engage in infringing activity, installing P2P software on a computer
 can easily result in 
you unintentionally sharing files (copyrighted music or even sensitive documents) with other 
P2P users, and you may then be personally responsible for the le
gal and financial consequences.
 Examples
: You use a file
-sharing program or c
lient, like BitTorrent, Gnutella, and 
LimeWire, Kazaa, BearShare, or others, to download or distribute movies, songs, games 
or software without authorization from the copyright owner. RIAA (Recording Industry 
of America) and MPAA (Motion Picture Associatio
n of America) can and do 
aggressively look for these violations. Alternatively, if you join iTunes and purchase 
several songs to play on your iPod, this is not a violation of copyright law. 
 In addition to the penalties outlined elsewhere in this policy, i
nfringement of copyrighted work, 
including unauthorized P2P file sharing, may also involve civil lawsuits by the copyright owner.  [
Possible penalties include actual damages and profits or statutory damages of up to $30,000
 or 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!4!more
 for each wo
rk infringed (
or up to $150,000 
or more
 for each willful infringement), court 
costs, attorney fees, and other civil damages.  [Criminal penalties for willful infringement may 
include, depending upon the value of the work(s) infringed, fines and imprisonment for up to 3 
years
 or more
 as provided in 18 USC 2319.
  [Please be aware that there are many legal alternatives for downloading media such as iTunes, 
Pandora, NetFlix, and Amazon MP3.  [A list of popular, legal, fee
-based and free alternatives is 
available to you at: 
 http://www.educause.edu/legalcontent
.  [See the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) 
(http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html
) and related federa
l regulations at 34 
C.F.R. ¤¤ 668.14 (b)(30) & 668.43(a)(10) for other copyright
-related requirements for US 
colleges and universities. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 steal, forge, lie or cheat with; snoop on; tamper with; misuse, damage, harass 
with; threaten with; hoard o
r monopolize; interfere with; violate the confidentiality of; 
masquerade with; or destroy any information, resource, equipment or software. This includes 
using your 
personal 
computing device
 for these
 activities against other users or against their 
informa
tion resources.
 Examples
: You must not access the account of another; you must not generate activities 
which consume more than your share of either system time or network bandwidth 
(including chain letters); you must not fraudulently log into any computer,
 etc. 
(Reference:
 http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode
/ (97/045
) You must not upload, 
post, or transmit content that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, libelous, invasive of 
another's privacy. This includes but is not limited to social networking sites, blogs, 
email or other electronic correspondence. You must not
 forge 
email headers or manipulate 
other identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any system or network activity.
  [YOU MAY NOT
 possess any software, resource, or equipment whose purpose is to effect one 
of the violations listed in the 
previous
 Provis
ion
 nor may you attempt to violate the previous 
Provision. Any such attempt will be considered to be the same as a violation.
  [Example
: You must not have in your account on any University
-owned system or on your 
personal computer programs 
that
 attempt to determine the passwords of others or obtain 
privileges on any computer to which you are not entitled.
  [If you attempt to obtain system 
privileges to which you are not entitled, you are as guilty as if you had succeeded. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 possess, wi
llingly receive, or distribute obscene material.
  [Examples
: Child pornography is absolutely against the law. It is a violation of Federal 
law to transmit this material across state lines, even electronically, and certain obscene 
materials are in violation 
of the Mississippi Code. (References:
 http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode/
 (97/005/0029)
 and 
http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode/
 (97/029/0101
)  [YOU MAY NOT
 violate the 
IT Appropriate Use Policy off
-campus anywhere in the world 
using University resources.
  [
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!5!Example
: An attempt to gain unauthorized entry to any computer off the University 
campus is as if you attempted to gain access to a computer here. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 use any University facility for non
-University commercial business or 
advertising, including unsolicited commercial 
email without written permission from the Provost 
and the CIO. Th
is includes partisan political activities; however, any officially sanctioned 
University student 
group may maintain an official W
eb page which presents objective 
information about the group itself. Commercial sponsorship of academic projects, e.g., the 
inclusion of banner ads on project web sites, is allowed in certain cases. These requests must be 
approved by the CIO.
  [Examples
: You may not use the statistics software on the academic shared systems to do 
work for off
- campus entities for which you are p
aid. The Young Democrats/Republicans 
may have a page 
that
 presents information about their activities and goals; they may not 
attempt to influence voters
Õ choices through that page. The sending of unsolicited bulk 
email (spamming) is not allowed when it is
 unrelated to the UniversityÕs mission.
  [YOU MUST
 connect all equipment and install all software in a manner that meets the technical, 
security
 and fair use standards set by 
the Office of 
Information Te
chnology
 (IT)
.  [Examples
: All IP addresses and domain names are owned and assigned by the 
IT as specified in the 
UM Policy for Domain Name Registration
 . World Wide Web, ftp, and 
other network services that interfere with f
air network use by others may be restricted by 
IT. You must follow proper use guidelines when using classroom technology, e.g.,
 powering down projectors according to vendor specifications. Improperly secured and 
patched systems are vulnerable to attack fro
m outside entities and may be used as 
platforms to propagate spam, computer virus and wormÕs to other hosts both on the 
campus and abroad resulting in loss of bandwidth and possible restrictions to other 
computer systems; accordingly, compromised systems w
ill be disconnected from the 
campus network as soon as they are detected.
  [YOU MUST TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU PUBLISH, TRANSMIT, OR 
POSSESS. PENALTIES 
 If you are suspected of violating this Policy, the University may impound any equipment, device, 
software, documents, or data that is involved. A search warrant will be obtained before 
impounding items not owned by the University. 
 If you have violated the
 Policy, you will incur the same types of disciplinary measures as 
violations of other University policies. Violation of state or federal free/statutes may lead to 
criminal or civil prosecution. 
 Students:
 Campus disciplinary measures may include, but are 
not limited to, failure in a class, 
permanent or temporary loss of information technology privileges, suspension or expulsion from 
the University, and restitution of expenses as well as charges for damages. 
  [

!!!6!Faculty and Staff:
 Campus disciplinary measures
 may include, but are not limited to, 
reassignment of duties, transfer, censure, suspension, termination, and restitution of expenses as 
well as charges for damages. 
 Off
-campus Users:
 The University may revoke the privileges of users who are found to be i
n violation and may report any serious violation to the users home campus authorities and to 
appropriate law enforcement officials. 
 INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
 Violations are most likely to be observed in two ways: 
 ¥!A system administrator detec
ts an anomaly and, in determining the cause of the problem, 
finds evidence of a violation. 
  [Caution:
 In exceptional cases, a system or network administrator may detect evidence of 
a violation while performing his or her duties operating or maintaining a s
ystem. In these 
instances the priorities of protecting the University against seriously damaging 
consequences and/or safeguarding the integrity of computers, networks, and data either at 
the University or elsewhere, may make it imperative that the systems 
administrator take 
temporary restrictive action immediately. In these instances, all restrictive actions taken 
must be documented and justified in accordance with this policy. The Complaint 
Committee and/or 
IT Security Coordinator
 must be immediately conta
cted so the 
complaint can be further investigated and processed.
 ¥!An individual observes what is perceived to be a violation. The office to be notified is 
determined by the status of the suspected violator: 
 o!Students: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Dean of Students. 
 o!Faculty: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Provost.  [
 o!Staff: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Vice Chancellor for 
Administration and Finance.  [[Minor 
infractions by any account holder may be 
reported directly to the Complaints Committee (
complaint@olemiss.edu)
.]  [The Complaints Committee accepts reports of minor infractions (anything which is not serious 
and
 which should be correctable by pointing out the infraction to the offender, e.g., a business 
card on a web page) and attempts to resolve them within 
seven 
business
 days
.  [If not resolved, 
the violator 
is reported through the 
IT Security Coordinator
 to 
his
 or her 
administrative office for 
stronger action. The systems administrator of a compromised system is free at any time to take 
immediate action to safeguard the University's infrastructure, including working with campus 
security to obtain a search warran
t at the first sign of suspicious activity. 
 IT personnel will also 
document the actions taken from the point of discovery and will prepare a non
-technical 
narrative for the use of the University. The CIO or designee may authorize monitoring of 
systems to 
gather information on any activity that is using University
-owned equipment or 
services. These activities will be logged by the systems administrator when undertaken and will 
be conducted in an appropriate manner approved by the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and the CIO.
  [
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!7!Incidents will be reported by the systems administrator to the 
IT Security Coordinator
, possibly 
the Complaints Committee, and, in addition, to the appropriate disciplinary office(s) (Dean of 
Students, Provost, or Vice Chancellor of Finance 
& Administration). These units will authorize 
such additional steps as may be necessary to collect evidence, including the execution of a search 
warrant, and setting the scope and duration of the investigation. The Complaints Committee and 
the 
IT Security 
Coordinator
 will work with the disciplinary office to decide when to notify the 
individuals involved that they are under investigation. If non
-University service providers are 
involved, they will consult with the University Attorney and the CIO to notify t
hem as soon as it 
is prudent to do so.
  [The collected evidence and the documents that record the actions of the systems administrator, 
IT staff, and the Complaints Committee will be forwarded to the disciplinary office for 
adjudication together with a reco
mmendation on any loss of privileges with respect to computing 
and telecommunications systems. The disciplinary office will report the outcome of the case to 
the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and to the CIO. In the case of suspected criminal violations, the 
Univ
ersity Police will be involved.
  [The accused has the right to petition the disciplinary office for the release of impounded material 
and the restoration of privileges. That decision may or may not precede the disposition of the 
case. In any event, any such
 decision must be communicated to the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and 
the systems administrator. Faculty and staff members against whom disciplinary action is taken 
may follow the prescribed methods for the resolution of work
-related conflicts, including the 
filing of a grievance.
