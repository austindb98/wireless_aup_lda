SCOPE
 
 
 
This policy applies to all MUS students using MUS
-
owned or managed computing and information 
resources for student purposes. In this policy "user" refers to student user, as distinct from any role the 
individual may also have as an employee (Policy
 
1303.1) or patron (Policy 1305.1).

g 
of those resources. Users and system administrators must guard against abuses that disrupt or threaten 
the viability of all systems, including those connected to the MUS telecommunication network, the State 
telecommunication network, and other telecommun
ication networks to which MUS systems are 
connected.
 
 
 
Each user is responsible for having knowledge of MUS policies concerning security, privacy, and 
acceptable computing practices.
 
 
Each user of MUS computing and information resources must act 
responsibl
y. Each user is responsible for the integrity of these resources. Each user of MUS
-
owned or 
managed computing systems must be knowledgeable of and adhere to MUS policies, respect the rights 
of other users by minimizing unnecessary network traffic that migh
t interfere with the ability of others to 
make effective use of shared resources, respect the integrity of the physical facilities and controls, and 
obey all pertinent federal, state, county, and local laws and ordinances. Each user must abide by these 
pol
icies, laws, and contractual obligations, and adhere to appropriate ethical standards.
 
 

Students should never, without explicit permission, modify or ins
tall software on MUS computers; attach 
unauthorized hardware or otherwise modify the MUS network in any manner; modify, delete, or in any 

prohibited by loc
al campus policies.
 
 
In that regard, each campus must clearly identify what MUS information technology resources are 
available for use by its students, and clearly identify those activities that are and are not appropriate for 
each resource. This includes 
but is not limited to use of resources such as e
-
mail systems, internal and 
external network facilities, student
-
accessible computer labs, and accounts on MUS
-
owned or operated 
computer systems.  [If a campus provides special services to residents of its un
iversity
-
provided housing, 
it must clearly identify what special services are provided and what activities are and are not appropriate 
in the use of those services by residents.
 
 
B.  [
ENSURING COMPLIANCE
 
 
It is the responsibility of the Student Affairs Offic
e on each campus to ensure that all students are aware 
of MUS policies and procedures concerning the use of MUS computing and information technology 
resources, understand them, and comply with them. In the case of special services provided to residents 
of 
university
-
provided housing, it is the responsibility of the campus housing operation unit to ensure that 
residents are aware of and comply with separate policies that govern the use of special services available 
only to housing residents.
