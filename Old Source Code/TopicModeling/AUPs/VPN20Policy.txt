I. Purpose The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidelines for Remote Access 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections to the UNCA trusted 
administrative network. 
II. Scope This Policy applies to all UNCA empl
oyees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers includ
ing all personnel aff
iliated with third parties utilizing VPNs to access the UNCA network. This Policy applies to 
implementations of all VPN that 
are directed through any type VPN Concentrator. III. Policy 
Approved UNCA employees and author
ized third parties (customers, 
vendors, etc.) may utilize the benefits of VPNs, which are a "user 
managed" service. This means that the 
user is responsible for selecting an Internet Service Provider (ISP), coordinating installation, installing any required software, and paying associated fees. Further details may be 
found in the Remote Access Policy. 
Additionally, 1) It is the responsibility of employees
 with VPN privileges to ensure 
that unauthorized users are not 
allowed access to UNCA internal 
networks via their VPN.  
2) VPN use is to be controlled using password authentication. When actively connected to the admini
strative network, VPNs will force all traffic to and from the PC ove
r the VPN tunnel: all other traffic will be dropped. 
 3) Dual (split) tunneling is NOT permitted; only one network 
connection is allowed. 4) VPN gateways will be set up and managed by the UNCA ITS office. 
5) All computers connected to UNCA internal networks via VPN or 
any other technology must use the most up-to-date anti-virus software that is the administrati
ve standard. Information on this 
software can be obtained from UN
CA User Support, this includes personal computers.  6) All computers connected to UNCA in
ternal networks via VPN must 
have the latest operating system security patches applied. 
Information on these patches can 
be obtained from UNCA User Support or your college computer consultant.  
7) Users of computers that are not UNCA-owned equipment must 
configure the equipment to comp
ly with UNCA Usage (#72) and  Network Security (#78) Policies.  8) Only ITS approved VPN clients may be used.  
9) By using VPN technology with personal equipment, users must 
understand that their machines are 
a de facto extension of UNCA's 
network, and as such are subject to the same rules and regulations 
that apply to UNCA-owned equipment, i.e., their machines must be 
configured to comply with all UNCA Usage (#72) and Network 
Security (#78) Policies.  
10) Peer-to-peer software is
 not allowed over VPN.  11) Computer with multiple user acc
ounts (ie true multiuser hosts) are 
not allowed to create VPN connectio
ns to the trusted network for the entire host and its users. Note: At this time we know of no way to 
allow single user VPN connections on multiuser computers.  

IV Procedures 1) To request VPN access, the employee mu
st complete the VPN access request 
agreement form and forward it to their supervisor.   The agreement is available at
