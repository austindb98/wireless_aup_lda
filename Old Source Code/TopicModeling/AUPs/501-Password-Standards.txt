ACCOUNTABILITY/APPLICABILITY:
 
 
This standard applies to all 
technology
 
and systems that are technically
 
and logically capable of 
supporting the standard.
  
This includes but is not limited to:  university owned desktop 
computers,
 
laptops, cel
l phones with UCF provisioned e
mail accounts, smal
l factor computing 
devices, UCF

s
 
electronic services, systems, and servers.  The standard covers all university 
resources
.
  
 
 
STANDARDS
 
STATEMENT:
 
 
Passwords are the most frequently utilized form of authentication for accessing a computing 
resource.  Due to the use of weak passwords, the proliferation o
f automated password
-
cracking 
programs, and the activity of malicious hackers and spammers, they are very often also the 
weakest link in securing data.  Greater risks require a h
eightened level of protection.  
Passwords 
must therefore follow the 
standards 
listed below.
  
 
 
Consult with the UCF Information Security Office if questions arise regarding the compliance of 
a system
 
with regard
 
to any of the following standards.
 
 
STANDARDS
:
 
General 
Account 
Password 
Standards
 
 
1.
 
All passwords (e.g.
, NID, 
email, web, desktop computer, etc.) should be strong 
passwords
.  
Privileged accounts have stricter password requirements.  In general, a

2.
 
All passwords
 
should meet the following 
standards
: 
 
a.
 
Be
 
at least 
eight
 
(
8
) alphanumeric characters long
 
(longer passwords are 
encouraged 
because they are 
often harder to guess or crack
)
.
 
b.
 
Use all of the following character types
 
at least once
:
 
i.
 
Uppercase 
letter
 
(A/a through Z/z)
 
ii.
 
Lowercase letter (A/a through Z/z)
 
iii.
 
Number (0
-
9)
 
iv.
 
Special character (e.g.
,
 
!,$,#,%)
 
c.
 
Passwords should not 
be word
s from any 
dictionary, 
in any 
language,
 
slang, 
dialect, jargon, based on 
easily guessed personal information,
 
(e.g.,
 
name
s of 
family members,
 
friends, 
pets, etc.
)
, 
birthdates
,
 
or other personal information such 
as 
an 
address 
or telephone 
number.
 
d.
 
Passwords should also not contain
 
three or more consecutive characters from 
an 

username (e.g., Joe Smith with use
rname jo123456 cannot 
include joe, oes, esm, smi, mit, ith, o12, or 456 in his password). 
 
e.
 
Blank passwords should not be used and 
are
 
not 
permitted
.
 
 
3.
 
Passwords
 
must be encrypted both
 
in storag
e
 
and in transit
.
 
a.
 
Passwords in 
storage
, including those stored in password management tools,
 
should be encrypted
 
using at least 256
-
bit industry accepted encryption (e.g., 
Advanced Encryption Standard [AES], Blowfish)
 
b.
 
Passwords in transit should be encrypted via TLS
 
protocol
.
 
 
4.
 
The same password should not be used for access 
that is
 
external to UCF (e.g., online 
banking, 
personal email accounts, personal desktop and/or laptop computers
, etc.)
 
 
5.
 
Systems
 
should 
observe these 
password 
age and history standards
 
via technical controls:
 
 
a.
 
Maximum password age should be no more than 60 days.
 
b.
 
Activate p
assword history and 
store at least the last 
24
 
passwords
.
 
 
6.
 
A
ttempts to guess a password should be limited to 
ten
 
(
1
0) incorrect guesses. 
Any 
attempts over 
ten (
10
)
 
guesses 
within 15 minutes (lockout counter reset
 
time period
) 
should 
automatically disable
/lock
 
the account
. Account 
should 
remain
 
locked
 
(lock
out
 
time
)
 
for 
15
 
minutes before 
a password
 
can be attempted again.
 
 
7.
 
UCF user account p
asswords should not be shared with anyone, including administrative 
assistants or IT administrators
.
 
 
8.
 
If a 
password is suspected to have been compromised, it should be changed immediately 
and the
 
security
 
incident reported to the IT manager, 
and the Security Incident Response 
Team (SIRT
.
)
 
SIRT contact information:  sirt@ucf.edu
.
 
 
9.
 
Audit l
og
 
or log
 
files 
must
 
never contain password information
.

passwords, default
 
SNMP strings).

Password Standards
 
In addition to the general 
password
 
standards
 
listed above
, the following
 
standards
 
appl
y
 
to 
any
 
administrative
 
account 
passwords
 
(su
ch as those that
 
maintain the access of other accounts
, 
or 
provide access to a security infrastructure
)
: 
 
 
1.
 
A
ll 
privileged
 
accounts must 
be protected using 
multi
-
factor authentication
 
where 
technically feasible.
 
 
2.
 
A
ttempts to guess a password should be limited to 
three (3
) incorrect guesses. Any 
attempts over 
three (3)
 
guesses within 15 minutes (lockout counter reset time period) 
should automatically disable/lock the account. The account 
should 
remain
 
locked
 
(lockout
 
time)
 
for 
15
 
minutes before a password can be attempted again.
 
 
3.
 
A
ll passwords 
shou
ld
 
b
e at least 
fifteen
 
(
1
5
) alphanumeric characters long
 
(lon
ger 
passwords are encouraged 
because
 
they are often harder to guess or crack
)
.
 
 
4.
 
Privileged account passwords should 
be configured to
 
not
 
expire, provided the other 
more stringent standards described in this section are implemented.
 
 
5.
 
Failed attempts should be logged, unless such action results in the display of a failed 
password
. 
I
t is recommended that these logs be retained for a minimum of 30 days
.  
Administrators should regularly inspect these logs and 
immediately report 
any 
irregularities or compromises
 
to SIRT.

c standing in the community), adversely affect a partner
