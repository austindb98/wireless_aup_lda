Safeguards
   Background
  The various units and departments at the university have a multitude of types of 
documents and data.
 To the extent particular documents or data types are not 
explicitly
 addressed within this document, 
it is the responsibility of the Data Trustee 
to classify
 data by considering the potential for harm to individuals o
r the university 
in the event of
 unintended disclosure, mod
ification
 or loss.
 Departments 
must
 be 
particularly mindful to protect sensitive
 personal information, such as social security 
numbers, Driver
™s license numbers and financial account numbers
; the
 disclosure of 
which may create ri
sk of identity theft.
