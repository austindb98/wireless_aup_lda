Introduction 
 
 
 
New 
Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
was founded in 1888 as Las Cruces College
. 
The Territorial Legislature of 1889 
established the land
-
grant Agricultural College and Experiment Station, which officially opened on January 21, 
1890
. 
During its first full academic year,
 
the college became known as the New Mexico College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts, the first degree granting institution in the Territory
. 
Under the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862 
and subsequent federal legislation, the special mission of land
-
gr
ant institutions has been to provide a liberal and 
practical education for students and to sustain programs of research, extension education, and public ser
vice
.
 
 
In 1960, New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts became New Mexico State 
U
niversi
ty
. 
Since that 
time, while sustaining excellence in those programs traditionally associated with land
-
grant institutions, New 
Mexico State has become a comprehensive doctoral level 
university
 
offering a wide variety of programs through the 
Graduate School 
and the colleges:  Agriculture and Home Economics, Arts and Sciences, Business Administration 
and Economics, Education, Engineering, and Health and Social Ser
vice
s.
 
 
New Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
is the state

s land
-
grant 
university
, serving the educational 
needs of New Mexico

s 
diverse population through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, and public ser
vice
.
 
 
The New Mexico Constitution 
establishes New Mexico State University as 

educational
 
i
nstitution
s
, and 
requires the legislature to provide for the control and management of the institution 
through a five member 
Board of Regents
, which serves as the 
g
overning 
b
ody 
for both 
New Mexico State University 
as well as for th
e 
N
ew Mexico Department 
of Agriculture.

2.
 
Principles of 
B
oard
 
Operation:
  
The 
Board of Regents
 
exercises its control over the institution 
through 
its policies as administered by the administration. Decisions of the 
Board of Regents
 
shall be made by the 
board
 
acting as a body in a duly constituted meeting; individual 
members of the 
b
oard may, however, discuss the affairs of the 
university
 
and obtain 
information pertaining thereto from any other members of the 
board
 
and from any employee 
or student of the 
university
. Policies of the 
b
oard shall be maintained in written form, but 
failure to do so shall not affect their validity. A member of the 
b
oard sh
all not be interested 
pecuniarily, either directly or indirectly, in any contract for building or improvement of the 
university
, or for the furnishing of supplies, ser
vice
s or materials to said institution. 
Contributions to the 
university
, in any form, by 
a member of the 
b
oard are not in violation of 
these bylaws. No one member should enter into correspondence as a member of the 
b
oard. 
This is a group operation and not an individual one; therefore, it is undesirable to have a 
letterhead specifically for the
 
b
oard.  Any change in organization or structure of any 
subdivision of this 
university
 
from the level of dean and higher and any other organizational 
change which the administration deems of sufficient importance shall be approved by the 
b
oard before it is
 
implemented.

may be changed by department head or 
other 
appropriate 
supervisor during an emergency, if needed.
 
 
2.
 
Reasonable Flexibility
:
  
In an emergency, both employer and employee should be as 
flexible as possible to enable employees to work, including facilitating working from 
home and other remote locations (telecommuting); allowing full
-
time employees to work 
part
-
time; using flexible work schedules; and other appropriate solutions.
 
 
3.
 
Extensio
n of Deadlines:  All probationary periods and other 
such 
deadlines will be

Responsibilit
ies
 
of Essential
, Alternate Essential and Standby Personnel
:  Essential 
personnel shall report for wor
k unless specifically directed by supervisor or authorities 
not to report for health and safety reasons.  Alternate essential personnel whose 
designations are changed to essential shall report for work upon notification of changed 
designation.  Standby per
sonnel, not designated as essential or alternate to essential, shall 
not report to work during a university State of Emergency and may only work if pre
-
approved by the NMSU Entity.
 
 
5.
 
Work Outside
 
Normal Scope of Employment Duties. Employees may be required 
to 
work outside their normal scope of responsibility as deemed necessary by appropriate 
NMSU administrator.  This includes employees with the necessary skills that are needed 
to work outside their colleges/vp units.  Base compensation will be at the indivi

regular base pay for their primary job unless other arrangements are approved by HR 
Services.  
 
 
6.

Exempt/salaried employees will receive regular base pay for time worked and be eligible 
for a hardship differential if excessive overtime is required.  Employees not able to work 
at any location or not needed to work will not receive regular 
pay but may be granted 
paid or unpaid leave consistent with university policies.

aberrations in the market by trading securities of comparable quality to further improve the overall 
rate of return on the portfolio. It is the policy to trade only if both an improvement in yield (pick
-
up in bas
is points) and an increase in net monetary return will be realized by the 
university
 
over 
the life of the 
original investment
. Three basic trading techniques are used to accomplish this goal:
 
 
1.
 
The Substitution Swap: this technique involves trading in owned
 
security of a certain class 
i.e
., U.S. Treasury Notes, for a comparable security of equal quality, i.e., U.S. Treasury Bills 
(or other Notes), for a net pick
-
up yield. The new security is a perfect 
substitute
 
for the old 
security in terms of quality, matu
rity, and marketability.
 
 
2.
 
The Intermarket Spread Swap: this technique takes advantage of the spreads in yield, which 
exist from, time
-
to
-
time between different sectors of the market, i.e., Treasuries vs. Agencies. 
(An example would be to sell Treasury Bill
s or Notes and purchase FHLB Discount Notes or 
debentures of comparable maturity when the spread becomes wider than is considered normal 
under prevailing market conditions.)
 
 
3.
 
The Maturity Extension Swap: this technique involves lengthening the maturity of 
owned 
securities when a normal 
up sloping
 
yield curve exists to take advantage of higher returns at 
longer maturities. (In the case of an extreme inverted yield curve, maturities can sometimes be 
shortened to achieve a net gain.) A yield pickup may be achi
eved by rolling out the curve 
within the same class of securities or by intermarket extensions which must be evaluated not 
only on the relative maturity extension, but also on the relative intermarket spread. Maturity 
extension swaps are subject to restric
tions imposed by cash disbursement requirements.
 
 
The investment manager will 
not
 
engage in any other Trading Techniques unless prior written 
approval is obtained from the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
administration and finance
.
 
 
The following criteria are es
tablished for evaluating a swap in the 

 
marketable 
securities portfolio:
 
 
1. 
 
On maturities of one year or more, the gain per transaction must be at least $1,000.00 per 

NMSU Policy Manual 
                                                 
                                                                                                             
Chapter 2 Page

of

2
 
 
million dollars (GPM) invested.
 
 
2.
 
On maturities of 90 days to one year, the 
gain per transaction must be at least $500.00 per 
million dollars invested.
 
 
3.
 
On maturities of less than 90 days, trade will be made at the discretion of the 

 
investment manager.
 
 
In many yield pickup transactions (particularly when interest rat
es are rising), a book loss must be 
recorded at the time of the sale of the owned investment. It is the policy of the 
university
 
to charge 
the loss against the interest income account, recognizing that this loss will be fully recovered, and 
an incremental 
gain will be earned, over the life of the original investment.
 
 
L.
 
Safekeeping and Collateralization:
 
All investment securities other than local financial institution 
Certificates of Deposit purchased by the 
university
 
will be held in the 

 
name
 
by a 
third
-
party custodian approved by 
university
 
administration. All transactions will be evidenced by 
safekeeping receipts.
 
 
Deposit
-
type securities will be collateralized in accordance with the State 
board
 
of Finance 
collateral policy.
 
 
M.
 
Authorized F
inancial Dealers and Institutions:
 
 
The 
d
irector
 
of 
t
reasury 
s
er
vice
s will maintain a 
list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment ser
vice
s. No deposit shall be made 
except in a qualified depository as established by the 
Board of Regents
. In addition, a list will be 
maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by credit
-
worthiness. These may include 
primary dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities & Exchange Commission Rule 
15C3
-
1 (uniform, net capital rule).
 
 
An annual review of the financial condition and registrations of qualified dealers and institutions 
will be conducted by the 
d
irector
 
of 
t
reasury 
s
er
vice
s. A current audited financial statement is 
required to be on file for each financial institution and b
roker/dealer with which the 
university
 
deposits and invests monies.
 
 
The 
university
 
will give first preference
 
to investment with local dealers and institutions within the 
guidelines of this policy. Investment with out
-
of
-
state dealers and institutions wil
l require prior 
approval of the 
s
enior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
a
dministration and 
f
inance
 
or 
and
 
designees.
 
 
N.
 
Case Pools and Interest Allocation:
 
Except as noted below, the investments of the
 
university
 
(including amounts held in interest
-
bearing demand and t
ime deposits) are pooled in order to 
determine a weighted average monthly interest earnings rate. In order to compute this rate, all such 
investment earnings are accrued monthly, including amortizing premiums and crediting discounts 
on short and long
-
term 
investments.
 
 
The monthly earning on these pooled invest
ments are allocated to various 
university
 
accounts in 
accordance with externally mandated requirements (
i.e
.
,
 
bond resolutions) and other internal 
designations. Nothing herein shall prohibit separatio
n of bond proceeds, reserve funds, or other 
non
-
discretionary funds from the pooled investment fund. The 
s
enior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
a
dministration and 
f
inance
 
approves all such internal designations. The allocation is based upon 
the average monthly cash bal
ance in each of these 
university
 
accounts, with the remaining balance 
of the pooled earnings being allocated to unrestricted current funds.
 
 
Under this m
ethod, all of these designated 
university
 
accounts (other than current unrestricted 
funds) will be pres
umed to have 100% of their cash balances invested in the pooled investment 
account, unless the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
administration and
 
finance 
determines that lesser 
percentage is to be utilized for a given account(s).
 
 
At the discretion of the 
s
enior
 
vice
 
president
 
for 
a
dministration and 
f
inance
 
separate investment 
accounts may be set up at external institutions and utilized to adequately monitor the earning of 
certain 
university
 
accounts. These separate accounts are also restricted to investments tha
t are 
considered relatively safe, as determined by the 
Board of Regents
.

A.
 
Purpose/General Policies regarding Naming
:  The primary purpose of this policy is to ensure 

endow
ment funds will generate sufficient fund distributions for their designated purposes. This 
policy
 
provides donors the opportunity to 
link their philanthropic interests with enduring 
recognition for either themselves or others, and allows the university to 
present donors with 
quantifiable funding opportunities.  University namings will undergo a high level of consideration 

some instances, honorific naming may be
 
appropriate for those occasions when an individual has 
provided exemplary, meritorious, or philanthropic support or service to the university.  To ensure 
good donor relations, written agreements will be signed by the university and the donor(s) 
outlining 
the terms of naming arrangements.  To enhance communication with all university 
constituents regarding naming policies, th
is policy and the 
minimum endowment thresholds

B.
 
Scope
: This policy applies to the naming of universit
y property and academic units throughout the 
NMSU system, including developed and undeveloped real property, capital assets, facilities and 
other space, as well as academic units. 
 
 
C.
 
Policy Administrator
: The Office of University Advancement, on behalf of t
he NMSU President 
and the Board of Regents, administers this policy to support, coordinate and manage university 
naming as outlined in this policy. The Naming Committee, chaired by the 
v
ice 
p
resident of 
u
niversity 
a
dvancement, is recognized as an advisory 
body that will review and render 
recommendations
, typically through the University Administrative Council,
 
to the NMSU 
President: 
 
 
1.
 
Authority of

Definitions
:
 
 
1.
 
Academic Unit:  An academic unit is an NMSU college, department, school, program, center 
or other academic organizational unit, or part thereof.
 
 
2.
 
Endowment:  
An endowment (also referred to as endow
ed gift funds) refers to a permanent 
funding gift held and managed by the NMSU Foundation Inc. on behalf of NMSU to provide 
income in perpetuity. The principal is invested and a portion of the annual earnings is used for 
purposes designated by the donor. 
 
 
3.
 
Facility:  NMSU facilities include but are not limited to buildings, rooms or structures; streets 
or malls; interior spaces and landscapes; and whether existing or yet to be constructed.  
 
 
E.
 
Endowment Guidelines
:  This policy addresses the naming, via endo
wment, of colleges, 
departments, major organizational units, including programs as well as lectureships, chairs 
/professorships, and fellowships/scholarships. 
 
 
1.
 
Out of respect for the donor, every effort should be made for all references to a named 
endowme
nt, including but not limited to:  publications, internal and external communication, 

NMSU Policy Manual

to reflect the recognition name.
 
 
2.
 
Normall
y the donor will have a maximum of five (5) years to meet the minimum funding 
level requirement, absent rare special circumstance
s. 
 
 
3.
 
In the case of deferred gifts, the gift must normally be irrevocable in nature before being 
eligible for naming.
 
 
4.
 
Academic and Major University Units.  The funding required for naming academic or other 
major university units should be of a level that 
will transform the very nature of the unit 
involved, enabling that unit to reach a level of excellence that would have been impossible 
using university funds alone.
 
 
a.
 
The gift should be in the form of an endowment, with income from the endowment used 
to pro
vide a margin of excellence for the unit involved.  
 
b.
 
The gift income derived from endowment earnings should not replace university funds 
previously made available to that unit. 
 
c.
 
Endowment levels will vary by school based upon its specific mission and scope
 
that 
determines needs and programs.  Certain units may require a higher minimum than those 
suggested. 
 
 
5.
 
Faculty Positions.  Naming opportunities for endowed faculty positions are available 
throughout the university.  Naming will be independent of all appo
intment and curriculum 
decisions which the university will continue to make in keeping with its policies, established 
practices and academic mission.  Distributed earnings may be used to provide partial salary 

 
specific teaching and research requirements, 
including laboratory equipment, support staff, graduate assistants, research materials and 
technology. 
 
 
6.
 
Chair.  An endowed
 
chair is a select faculty position filled by an outstanding scholar and 
teacher, as ju
dged by rigorous nationally accepted standards.  Some colleges, schools or 
departments may require a higher amount of funding, which is often market driven.
 
 
7.
 
Professorship.  An endowed professorship is typically held by a faculty member whose 
accomplishmen
ts indicate potential for national and international leadership and distinction in 
their field, and whose current efforts are focused on honing teaching skills and/or establishing 
a superior record of research or other scholarly activity. Distributed earni
ngs may be used to 

research needs.
 
 
8.
 
Lecture Series.  An endowed lecture series play an important role in the academic life of the 
campus.  They allow faculty, sta
ff, students, and the larger NMSU community to interact with 
distinguished leaders who influence disciplines, society, the nation or the world.  Because of 
the intensive planning and implementation required for lecture series, these should be 
determined in
 
consultation between the Office of University Advancement, departmental 
administration and the donor.  In some instances, it is beneficial to structure biennial lectures 
and/or link a gift to an existing lecture series.  The endowment provides the resourc
es to cover 
the expenses of bringing renowned speakers to the campus, such as honoraria, publicity, and 
the expenses of the host faculty members. A named lecture series may be established within a 
unit or may be campus
-
wide in nature.
 
 
9.
 
Fellowships and Assi
stantships.  Fellowship awards may include a research or teaching 
assignment if deemed appropriate.  Assistantships require students to work in exchange for 
this support. 
 
 
a.
 
Graduate Fellowships and Assistantships.  Graduate Fellowships and Assistantships 
p
rovide a vital means of bringing the best and brightest graduate students to New Mexico 
State. Students are working toward an advanced degree in any graduate program.  
 
b.
 
Postdoctoral Fellowships.  Recent Ph.D. graduates continue their research agenda for a 
one to two
-
year period in a focused environment bringing innovative research to the 
campus.

Scholarships.  Scholarships funded through an endowment may be awarded to an 
undergraduate student, graduate or a professional student on the basis of need, acade
mic merit 
or a combination of factors.
 
 
11.
 
Other Named Endowment Opportunities.  Examples of other endowed funds which may be 
negotiated on a case by case basis include, but are not limited to:
 
 
a.
 
Excellence Funds support a college, school, department, academic
 
discipline, 
building/ground maintenance or other university program of interest to the donor.  
Typically, distributed earnings enhance the selected program by supporting enrichment 
activities above and beyond budgeted expenditures.
 
b.
 
Teaching, Research or S
taff Funds allow the university to recognize outstanding 
teaching, service, research, special programs, and staff members.  Distributed earnings 
may be used as an award and/or to provide enrichment activities above and beyond 
budgeted expenditures.
 
 
F.
 
Facili
ties Naming Guidelines
:  This policy applies to the naming of facilities including buildings 
and structures, interior spaces, and landscapes. 
 
 
1.
 
Out of respect for the donor, every effort should be made for all references to a named 
facility, including but 
not limited to facilities signage, directional signage, publications, 
internal and external communications, to reflect the recognition name.
 
 
2.
 
Because of the relative permanence of decisions to name buildings, areas, or spaces, it is 
prudent to allow reason
able time for consideration at each stage of the process.
 
 
3.
 
New Facilities.  Naming opportunities involving new facilities must be approved by the 
NMSU President and the Board of Regents, after consideration of the recommendation from 
the Naming Committee. 
 
 
a.
 
Naming opportunities offered to donors as part of a capital campaign are to be 
coordinated through the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement.
 
b.
 
Private fundraising goals will be determined by construction costs, and may include a 
required
 
endowment for maintenance of the facility.  
 
c.
 
Endowment raised will be distributed proportionately among donors of the various 
naming opportunities.
 
d.
 
Naming opportunities for facilities must be defined and approved prior to the launch of 
the fundraising eff
ort.  The most significant gifts will normally be solicited at the outset 
of the fundraising campaign, and clarity and consistency with lead donors on the 
opportunities and policies is essential.  
 
e.
 
An initial list of the proposed naming opportunities for a
ny new facility project is to be 
coordinated through the Office of University Advancement.  This list may be revised as 
planning proceeds and the fundraising plan is developed.  
 
f.
 
This initial list of proposed naming opportunities is to include a descriptio
n of the size 
and function of all spaces proposed for naming as well as a plan for the display or 
physical presentation of the names.
 
g.
 
For gifts involving the naming of benches, fountains, display space, or other outdoor 
structures or areas, the gift must c
over the entire cost of the structure or installation and if 
ongoing operations and maintenance cost will be incurred, an endowment sufficient to 
cover these costs may also be required.  
 
 
4.
 
Existing Facilities: Existing facilities as yet unnamed are availab
le to be named for a donor 
under each of the following situations:
 
 
a.
 
In cases of major renovations which extend throughout an existing building:
 
 
i.
 

 
renovation and mainten
ance. 
 
ii.
 
what constitutes a major renovation is a matter determined in individual cases by the 
Vice President for the Office of University Advancement in collaboration with the 

NMSU Policy Manual

appropriate college/department administrator. 
 
 
b.
 
In cases where substantial gifts 
are made by donors to endow programs carried on within 
 
those buildings:  
 
 
i.
 
the guideline for endowment would be equal to half the replacement cost of the facility;
 
ii.
 
this matter may be determined  in individual cases by the Vice President for the Office 
of 
University Advancement in collaboration with the appropriate college/department 
administrator.
 
 
5.
 
Portion of a Facility or External Spaces:  Naming a portion of a building or external spaces of 
the university must be approved by the NMSU President, after con
sideration of the 
recommendation
s
 
from the Naming Committee
 
and/or University Administrative Council
.  
 
 
a.
 
To name rooms, laboratories, centers, or areas within new or renovated facilities, or 
external spaces such as entryways or gardens, donors must provide
 
the minimum 
specified level of gifts including endowment as determined by the Office of University 
Advancement in collaboration with the appropriate college/department administrator.  
 
b.
 
The naming opportunities and levels would be based upon the size, use,
 
and priority of 
the space.  
 
c.
 
Private fundraising goals will be determined by construction costs, and may include an 
endowment for maintenance of the facility.  Endowment will be distributed 
proportionately among donors of the various naming opportunities.
 
6.
 
Donor Initiated Projects:  From time to time, a prospective donor will propose a gift to fund a 
project or activity no specifically addressed in this policy, in which case, the following will 
apply: 
 
 
 
a.
 
If ongoing operations and maintenance costs will be i
ncurred, an endowment sufficient to 
cover these costs may also be required.
 
b.
 
Such donor initiated gifts are subject to the approval from the NMSU President and 
the 
Board of Regents, after consideration of the recommendation from the Naming 
Committee.
 
 
G.
 
Durat
ion of Naming
:  As the university grows, so do the space and academic needs of the campus.  
In order to successfully meet these changing needs, it may become necessary from time to time to 
relocate, remove or eliminate named facilities or academic units.  
Should a named property be 
affected by such changes, the Naming Committee will be convened to discuss and review each 
issue on a case by case basis.

United Way
 
 
The 
university
 
participates in the annual community United Way Fund drive.  Personnel are appointed 
by the 
president
 
to contact 
university
 
employees to support this endeavor.  The purpose of this program

All gifts of money, securities, and other funds can be invested to the greatest advantage of the

if said gifts are made to th
e NMSU Foundation, Inc. for the sole use and benefit of the 
university.
  
Therefore, to the fullest extent permitted by law and by any controlling documents, all gifts 
and donations to the

should be managed, invested, reinvested, and distributed 
by and 
through the 
NMSU

desiring to make gifts or donations for the benefit of the 
university
 
and its respective campuses that 
such gifts or donations 
are
 
made to NMSU Foundation, 
Inc.  The return address furnished to donors 
and on all printed materials must be that of the NMSU Foundation, Inc., the Development Office, or 
the Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement.  All gifts received by the 
university,
 
including gi
fts to any college, department or division, should be reported directly and immediately to 
the Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement.  Gifts in kind (noncash contributions) 
may be reported by memorandum or letter; gifts of cash or securit
ies should be delivered promptly to 
the Development Office for receipting and deposit.  The Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement will be responsible for providing an official receipt to the donor, for appropriate 
acknowledgment, and for 
informing the appropriate campus personnel. However, departments 
awarding restricted gifts for student aid are entirely responsible for ensuring that all donor criteria, 
financial and otherwise, have been met.  The 
board
 
prefers that real estate and gifts
-
in
-
kind be given 
free of restrictions which would reduce the full range of educational benefits which could be realized 
from the gift.  If restrictions are imposed upon the gift
,
 
or if the gift is such as to require costs of care, 
maintenance or upkeep, su
ch gift must be first approved by the 
board
 
or 
its
 
designees before 
acceptance by the 
board
.  Gifts of real estate may be given through the
 
NMSU 
Foundation, but are 
subject to the policies and the procedures of the 
NMSU 
Foundation.
 
 
A.
 
Gift Income Spending Po
licy
: The 
university
 
recognizes the importance of private gift income in 
providing its colleges and departments the flexibility needed to achieve 
its
 
goals and objectives.  
The 
university
 
also recognizes that different colleges and departments will have va
rying needs and 
priorities for the use of the private gift income as they continue to develop and maintain quality 
programs.  This policy is designed to provide those areas receiving private gifts the maximum 
amount of latitude to address these differing g
oals and objectives while at the same time 
maintaining the fiduciary responsibility inherent in the acceptance of these funds.  Gift income 
received by the 
university
 
from any external source, including the 
NMSU 
Foundation, will be 
expended in compliance w
ith this policy.  In all cases, exceptions may be made if these types of 
expenditures are sanctioned by 
the Offices of the 
P
resident
 
or 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
and 
P
r
ovost
 
for college or 
university
-
wide functions.  All expenditures must be for the enhance
ment or 
benefit of the 
university,
 
in recognition of the 

 
official mission statement.  In general, 
gift funds will be recorded in the current restricted fund, as they are externally restricted to 
purpose, even if internally unrestricted as to n
ature of expenditure.  Only those gift funds which 
are received by the 
university
 
for any related 
university
 
purpose, without restriction of any type, 
are to be recorded in the current unrestricted fund.  Within this policy, restricted fund income will 
be 
subdivided into restricted and unrestricted gifts based only on the level of donor specification 
attached to the gift, as explained below.
 
 
B.
 
Restricted Gift Income
:  For the purpose of this policy, restricted gift income is defined as all gift 
income on whi
ch the donor has placed specific restrictions beyond the general purpose for which 
the income is to be used.  Thus, income designated for a specific college or department's general 
use will be classified as unrestricted gift income, as long as that college
 
or department is given full 
authority to decide how the funds are to be best spent in compliance with the general guidelines 
detailed above.  Any gift income which must be spent for a specific purpose, such as scholarships 
or travel reimbursement, or unde
r any specific conditions, such as following a certain event or 
date, will be classified as restricted.  All restricted gift income, if accepted and expended, will be 
expended according to the written restrictions of the donor, without exception.  The Offi
ce of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement will be responsible for accepting these restrictions 
before the gift is accepted on behalf of the 
university.
  
Following this approval, the documented 
restrictions will take precedence over the guidelines
 
for disbursement of funds outlined below.
 
 
C.
 
Unrestricted Gift Income
:  For the purpose of this policy, unrestricted gift income is defined as all 
gift income received by the 
university
 
and not classified as restricted gift income.  Expenditures 
allowable f
rom this category of gift income will be limited by applicable laws, statutes, and 
regulations, and by this policy.  It will be the responsibility of the Business Office to identify gifts 
as unrestricted, and to verify that donor's intent related to the de
partment within the 
university
 
in 
which the funds are to be spent is honored.
 
 
D.
 
Authorization Structure
:  The standard approval structure in place for expenditure of non
-
gift 
funds will be followed for gift funds.  All non
-
payroll expenditures are to be app
roved by the 
d
epartment 
d
ead (where applicable), 
d
ean or 
d
irector, and Office of the Senior 
V
ice
 
P

.
 
 
E.
 
Cash 
Disbursement Controls
:  All existing 
university
 
internal controls will apply to disbursements 
made from gift funds.  All requests for expenditure will be submitted on the appropriate form; 
separate vouchers exist for requesting disbursements directly from 
the 
university
 
and the 
NMSU 
Foundation.  All vouchers will be accompanied by invoice or receipt support, or the attestation of 
the individual claiming reimbursement if other documentation is not applicable.
 
 
F.
 
Guidelines for Disbursements of Funds
:  All gift
 
income funds will be used by or for the benefit of 
the 
university
 
in fulfilling its mission of teaching, research, and public ser
vice
, including expenses 
sanctioned for the improvement of employee morale.  All types of expenditures falling under these 
gui
delines will be allowable, with the following exceptions:
 
 
1.
 
Any payment in conflict with existing law, statute, or regulation applicable to private gift 
funds.
 
 
2.
 
Charitable contributions made to entities or individuals external to the 
university.
  
Where 
appr
opriate, expenses incurred by separate nonprofit organizations which could have 
legitimately been considered 
university
 
expenses, such as those incurred by a separate student 
organization engaged in a 
university
 
-
related function, may be transferred with t
he approval of 
the Office of 
Senior 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
Administration
 
and Finance 
to the 
university.
 
 
3.
 
Any duplicate payment for goods and ser
vice
s, or reimbursement of employee expense.  
Duplicate payments include the reimbursement of actual travel expense
 
to employees who 
have already received per diem payment through other sources.
 
 
4.
 
Payment for 
university
 
employee ser
vice
s outside the payroll system.
 
 
5.
 
Gifts made to 
university
 
personnel except as recognition of ser
vice
 
to the 
university.
 
 
6.
 
Loans to any indi
vidual, unless the gift was made for the specific purpose of establishing a 
loan fund.
 
 
7.
 
Payment of fines imposed for violations of local, state, or federal law, unless resulting from 
university
 
negligence.
 
 
8.
 
Memberships in organizations, country clubs, or o
ther expenditures for any individual, where 
it cannot be demonstrated that the expenditure is for the enhancement or benefit of the 
university.
 
 
G.
 
Endowment Trust
:  The 
Board of Regents
 
approved the revocable Endowment Trust Agreement to 
cover the establi
shment of endowments, making it possible to take money that has been privately 
contributed to the 
NMSU 
Foundation for endowed chairs, professorships, or lectureships and 
match it with monies from the State of New Mexico.  The monies may be placed together 
into a 
trust, managed by the 
NMSU 
Foundation in such a way that the 
NMSU 
Foundation retains title to 
the private money and the 
board
 
retains title to the state money in a revocable trust.  The 
board
 
may designate a change in trustee at 
its
 
discretion at an
y time or may dissolve the agreement if 
it
 
desire
s
.  The assignment may allow the 
NMSU 
Foundation its usual management fee as trustee. It 
must, however, contain provisions (1) for termination of the placement of all or part of these 
endowments in the trust
 
at any time at the 
board

s sole discretion; (2) for annual accountings; and 
(3) for absolute authority on the part of the 
board
 
for the disposition of each of the endowments 
(consistent with the terms of each particular endowment).

Affiliated Organizations
:  Numerous organizations have been established to support 
the 
Board of Regents
 
in a variety of ways and are separate, not
-
for
-
profit entities.  The focus of the 
following policy statement is on those or
ganizations whose primary functions are to solicit, 
manage, and distribute funds and other assets that are given to these organizations for the support 
of the 
university
 
in general or specific colleges or other program areas of the 
university.
  
The 
univers
ity
 
recognizes advantages of these organizations, such as:
 
 
1.
 
Creating an opportunity for private individuals and organizations to invest in the enrichment 
of the programs with greater assurance that the benefits of their gifts supplement, not 
supplant, stat
e appropriations to the institution.
 
 
2.
 
Providing a corporate structure for managing private gifts, including endowments and 
income
-
producing real property, that do
es
 
not jeopardize the 

 
tax
-
exempt status, 
create unnecessary unrelated business ta
x obligations, or create additional liabilities for the 
university.
 
 
3.
 
Creating an effective forum for alumni and community leaders to participate in and contribute 
to strengthening the 
university
 
through their participation in the solicitation, management, 
and 
distribution of private gifts and donations to the 
university.
 
 
(Other separate entities have been established for purposes unrelated to soliciting or managing 
gifts and donations on behalf of the 
university
; i.e., the NMSU Research Park Corporation an
d 
Arrowhead Center, Inc.,
 
which engage in the commercialization of research productivity.  
However, this policy focuses on those organizations created to actively engage in raising 
funds for the 
university.
)
 
 
K.
 
R
ecognition
:  Any organization formed to rep
resent the 
university
 
or any college, department, or 
program area of the institution will receive approval by the 
university
 
to represent it to prospective 
donors.  A condition of any recognition of an organization will be that the organization agrees to 
c
onduct its business in concert with 
university
 
policy for such organizations.  A written agreement 
will be executed between the 
university
 
and each organization, consistent with these policies but 
recognizing the specific significantly performing fund
-
rais
ing functions until after the date of 
adoption of this policy (10/90) will be established as an arm of the 
NMSU 
Foundation, unless 
otherwise approved by the 
Board of Regents
 
upon the recommendation of the 
president
 
(or 
designee).
 
 
L.
 
Statement of Purpose
: 
 
The purpose of the organization will be clearly defined as being for the 
sole benefit of the 
university,
 
or one or more of its specific programs.  In order for the 
university
 
to be able to support the organizations and not be in conflict with the state

s 
anti
-
donation laws, 
the benefits to the 
university
 
from the organization will be spelled out in the agreement.
 
 
M.
 
Structure of the Organization
:  Organizations may structure themselves in any manner they deem 
appropriate to fulfill their role and responsi
bilities to the 
university,
 
with the following 
understandings:
 
 
1.
 
The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any amendments should have the approval of 
the 
university.

A regent, the 
president
 
(or designee) may be included a s voting member of the governin
g 
board of the organization.
 
 
3.
 
Unless specifically agreed otherwise by the 
university
 
and the organization, the composition 
of the organization

s governing board will be such as to assure continuation of the 
organization as an independent, legal entity sepa
rate from the 
university.
  
Normally, more 
than 50 percent of the governing board membership of the organization must be non
-
university
 
employees to assure continuation of the organization as an independent, legal entity 
separate from the 
university.
 
 
4.
 
When 
an organization has a beneficial affiliation with an organizational unit, the 
university
 
organizational unit should be expected to provide the staff support for the organization.  No 
such organization will use funds received by the organization for the ben
efit of the 
university
 
to employ staff independently of the 
university.
  
The 
university
 
and the organization may 
agree to allocate some of the income the organization earns to the 
university
 
for the specific 
purpose of supplementing institutional staff sup
port.  This provision does not preclude the 
affiliated organization from directly retaining professional ser
vice
s as is deemed necessary for 
the organization to fulfill its responsibilities to the donors and to the 
university,
 
with the 
understanding that t
he retention of fund
-
raising and/or public relations consultants must be 
approved by the 
vice
 
president
 
for 
university
 
a
dvancement.
 
 
5.
 
The affiliated organization

s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws should assure the retention 
of the organization

s legal 
status as a tax
-
exempt non
-
profit organization pursuant to Section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor statute, if applicable.
 
 
N.
 
Solicitation of Gifts and Donations
:  Recognized affiliated organizations may organize and 
conduct fund
-
raising campaigns as they deem appropriate, except that major multi
-
year campaign 
solicitation of gifts and donations to support new academic programs or ser
vice
s, the major 
renovation of existing buildings, or the construction of new facilities may not be
 
initiated without 
the prior approval of the 
president
 
of the 
university.
  
The initiation of any fund
-
raising campaign 
by any organization must be coordinated with the overall fund
-
raising activities of the Office of 
the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advan
cement to assure proper contact with potential donors.  
Each organization will, in concert with the Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement, establish procedures for the review and acceptance of gifts and donations and for 
the coordination 
of solicitations and prospect contacts.  The acceptance of any gift or donation that 
contains restrictions as to its use requires a matching fiscal obligation of the 
university,
 
creates a 
future obligation of the 
university,
 
or involves real property must 
be approved by the 
president
 
(or 
designee).
  
Although each organization would be expected to maintain records of gifts and 
donations received and to properly acknowledge such gifts, the 
university
 
has designated the 
Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
nivers
ity
 
Advancement as the central record
-
keeping agency for 
all gifts and donations received on behalf of the 
university.
  
The receipt of all gifts and donations 
must be reported to the Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement.  The Office of 
t
he 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement is available to advise and/or assist any affiliated 
organization in designing and conducting fund
-
raising campaigns. No affiliated organizations will 
accept any funds intended for a 
university
 
organizational uni
t which requires performance or 
ser
vice
 
by the 
university.
  
Income generated by a 
university
 
program or ser
vice
 
is revenue of the 
university
 
and must be directly deposited into a 
university
 
account.
 
 
O.
 
Management of Gifts and Donations
:  All gift monies, 
whether received directly by the 
university
 
or indirectly through a 
university
-
affiliated organization, will be managed in accordance with 
investment policies approved by the 
Board of Regents
.  Affiliated organizations are encouraged to 
deposit their gift 
receipts with the 
university
 
for the specific organization. Oversight of the funds 
deposited in these agency accounts is the responsibility of the organization. The 
university
 
will 
provide all accounting ser
vice
s related to the funds for the organization. 
 
Short
-
term investment 
income earned by the 
university
 
on funds in these accounts will be allocated to the accounts.  Gifts 
received in the form of endowments by any recognized affiliated organization should be assigned 
to the 
NMSU 
Foundation, for investme
nt management purposes.  All endowments must be 
managed in accordance with investment policies approved by the 
board
.  The identity of 
individual endowments will be maintained by the 
NMSU 
Foundation; however, endowment funds 
may be co
-
invested in a pooled 
funds approach.  Consolidation of the endowment investment 
management program provides the opportunity for cost
-
effective management of the endowments.

Endowments retained by the organizations or transferred to the 
NMSU 
Foundation through 
revocable trust 
agreements will be maintained on the organization

s books.  Gifts received in the 
form of real property will be managed in accordance with the donor

s request.  If the donor 
specifies that the property be used by the 
university
 
in its gift form, such as ar
t work, library 
books, real estate, etc., the property will be transferred to the 
university.
  
If the donor desires that 
the property be used to establish an endowment, or if the gift is real property or property interest, 
the gift will be assigned to the 
NMSU 
Foundation, for management purposes.  The 
NMSU 
Foundation may retain the real property and use the income earned to accomplish the donor

s gift 
objectives.  If the donor permits, and it is a better investment management decision to dispose of 
the real
 
property, the 
NMSU 
Foundation will use the proceeds from these sales to establish the 
endowment.  The 
NMSU 
Foundation will obtain 
university
 
approval before disposing of any real 
property.  No individual member, director, or officer of an affiliated organ
ization should accept 
any gift or gratuity that is offered because of the individual

s position held with the organization
 
 
P.
 
Distribution of Funds
:  Affiliated organizations will not disburse directly any funds in the form of 
compensation to a 
university
 
employee without the express written approval of the 
president
 
of the 
university
 
and/or 
Board of Regents
.  Exceptions may be made for awards, recognition, etc.  Any 
funds intended for employee compensation will be transferred to a 
university
 
account and 
s
ubsequently disbursed in accordance with 
university
 
policies and procedures. The affiliated 
organizations will receive interest income earned on funds in agency bank accounts held by the 
university
 
in the name of the organizations, and may use such income 
to cover operating expenses 
directly incurred by the organizations. Organizations should establish policies for the review of 
any business transactions involving its members and the organization.  Members, directors, and 
officers of the organization should
 
disqualify themselves from making, participating in, or in any 
way attempting to use their position to influence decisions in which they have or would have a 
financial interest.  Organizations will establish policies which preclude the use of any funds 
re
ceived or earned by the organization to support any political candidate.  Organization funds will 
be accounted for in the 
university
 
agency

s fund, unless the 
university
 
expressly approves the 
organization

s separate accounting system.  All separate system
s will follow all 
university
 
internal 
control policies where applicable.
 
 
Q.

: Organizations shall provide the 
university
 
with the results of annual f
inancial audits 
performed by an independent auditing firm selected by the organization.  Any independent audit 
firm selected by an organization that is not the same firm selected by the 
university
 
must provide 
the necessary audit confirmations and assistan
ce to the 

 
external auditor upon request.  
Organizations not required to provide an independent audit report should furnish to the 
university
 
an annual financial report signed by the organization

s

and treasurer.  The 
Office of 
Audit 
Ser
vice
s staff may review all items approved by the organization

s board for release to the 
university,
 
with the understanding that such items and any reports related to them will fall under 
the organization

s internal audit policy.  This information will 
not become a part of the 

 
public records.  The organization will not be used to provide any instructional,

university
 
department or 
individual 
university

Records Integrity and Retention
 
 
A.
 
Records Integrity
:
  
Because the 
university
 
business records and reports are of critical importance 
in meeting fina
ncial, legal, and management obligations, they must always be prepared 
promptly, 
accurately and truthfully.  Those who rely on these records and reports have a right to timely and 
accurate information.  The integrity of 
university
 
records is based on valid
ity, accuracy, and 
completeness.  All employees involved in creating, processing, recording, and reviewing such 
information are responsible for ensuring such integrity.  
Supporting documentation and records for 
transactions,
 
such as agreements, invoices, r
equest for reimbursement, and time and effort 
reporting must fairly and fully support the actual purposes and amounts of the transactions.  
Transactions must be recorded in the proper account.  All 
university
 
a
ssets, liabilities, and

Establishment of Controlled Access Areas for Motoriz
ed Vehicles
 
[Adopted by 
Administrative Council 12.11.07
, with e
ffective
 
date of
 
01.08.08; 
r
atified by Board of Regents 
07.15.08] 
 
 
A.
 
Background
:
  
The operation of motorized vehicles (electric or combustion engine) in a university 
setting is always a challeng
e between providing adequate access to enable the operational needs of 
the campus to be met versus the pedestrian nature and desired feel of a campus setting. If the rules 
established are too restrictive then day to day operations of a campus are harmed. I
f no restrictions 
are in place then vehicles are daily operated in a manner that is not in the best overall interest of 
the institution. 
 
 
B.
 
Legal Basi
s
:
  
State law establishes the ability for local jurisdictions to place restrictions on the 
operation of mot
orized vehicles on controlled access areas. The enforcement of these restrictions, 
once established, falls to the police department. Violations of these controlled access restrictions 
will be cited in accordance with state law. 
 
 
C.
 
Need for Controlled Access
:
  
Operation of motorized vehicles on sidewalks is a direct conflict 
with their primary intended use for pedestrian traffic. Furthermore it damages the sidewalks 
resulting in increased cost to maintain this infrastructure in a reasonable condition. Operati
on of 
motorized vehicles on turf areas damages turf and trees, thereby harming the investment made in 
the establishment and maintenance of our landscaped areas of the campus. 
 
 
D.
 
Valid Reasons for Access
:
  
There are valid reasons for operating motorized vehi
cles within 
controlled access areas: 
 
 
1.
 
Motorized wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (Segway Human Transporters), or 
other motorized equipment used to provide disabled access. 
 
 
2.
 
Response to emergencies.  Emergencies include any action to prote
ct human life; well being 
and to prevent potential damage to property or to respond to utility outages. 
 
 
3.
 
Deliveries to or transport from specified buildings otherwise inaccessible. It is recognized that

Def
ined project specific access
:
  
Certain activities such as movement of heavy loads, athletic 
events, special events, projects involving the remodel or construction of campus facilities and 
infrastructure require, by their very nature, limited entry to contr
olled access areas of the campus. 
This access route will be established by the project manager as best possible and signed 
accordingly during the course of the event/project life. 
 
 
F
.
 
Use of Turf Vehicles
:
  
Maintenance of the campus turf areas requires ac
cess by specialized turf 
vehicles.  Nothing in this rule is intended to restrict access to turf areas by these vehicles. 
 
 
G
.
 
Non
-
emergency Access by Police, Fire and Shuttle Vehicle
s
:
 
 
Access rights are given to Police 
and Fire response vehicles for traini
ng activities and patrol activities when access will increase the 
safety of campus population and its real property assets. Limited access on approved routes is 
granted to vehicles providing shuttle service to the NMSU campus.

and includes such vehicles as 
golf carts, turf 
vehicles and small rough terrain vehicles 
which operate at speeds under 20 mph, and which 
are 
allowed on controlled access areas and/or s
treets of the campus.
 
U
tility carts are used to 
efficiently 
move people, deliver supplies, and carry tools or small equipment throughout the workplace. 
 
 
B.
 
Training 
for Utility Cart Operators
: 
Operation of utility carts on sidewalks poses risk to 
pedestrians
 
and therefore requires special training and responsibility to prevent incidents and 
potential injury. All individuals operating utility carts must be trained before using the vehicles.
  
Reading and understanding the Utility Cart Safety Program and respons
ibilities of cart operation 
plus additional machine specific use instruction will serve as the required training to be 
administered by each department or area utilizing utility carts.
 
 
C.
 
Training for Operators of Other Low Speed Vehicles
:  
Other low speed ve
hicles capable of 
exceeding 20 mph must be primarily operated over roadways, not controlled access areas. 
Individuals operating low speed roadway use vehicles will be required to attend Defensive Driving 
and be permitted according to the 
NMSU Vehicle Use Procedures

and/or, threats of violence made in any medium (verbal, electronic, telephonic, written, 
gestures, etc).  It also includes all incidents of hate cri
mes, dating violence, and domestic 
violence.   
 
 
E.
 
General  Principles: 
 
 
1.
 
Early Reporting and Intervention: While potential incidents of violence are at the forefront of 
concern, this policy is intended to address individual behaviors that may be, or may bec
ome, a 
disruption to the environment, whether classroom, office, housing or other university facility.  
Outreach at an early stage is desirable to prevent violence in some instances, and to retain an 
employee or student in more instances.  This policy is t
herefore designed to encourage the 
reporting of behaviors of concern before they lead to violence or other serious harm.  In the 
unfortunate event that a critical incident should occur, administrators are not relieved of their 
duties under other policies a
nd protocols (e.g. emergency notification and response; support to 
victims of violence; internal and/or police investigation into alleged misconduct; and 
student/employee disciplinary action and/or punitive consequences, including arrest). 
 
 
a.
 
Any person, in
cluding university employees and students, who observes behavior of 
concern is encouraged to submit a report under this policy. 
 
b.
 
Persons who in good faith submit a report or take other action authorized by this policy 
shall not be subjected to adverse acti
on for having done so.
 
 
c.
 
It is acknowledged that some individuals may be both student and employee; in those 
situations, action will be taken in the best interest of the individual and the institution, 
and may include administrative action under either stud
ent policies/procedures or 
employee policies/procedures, or both. 
 
d.
 
As part of a larger and institution
-
wide commitment to a secure campus and workplace 
environment, the university is committed to the development of preventive measures.  In 
addition to the 
work of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and/or 
NMSU Police Chief and/or designee; other examples include: pre
-
employment screening, 
employee assistance program, student support services, and other outreach and 
educational initiatives. 
   
 
e.
 

-
Employee Management Services 
provides collaborative problem
-
solving assistance to supervisors and employees in the 
area of conflict resolution in an attempt to address and diffuse tensions caused by 
in
terpersonal disputes or other reasons, before disputes in the workplace reach a level at 
which violence may erupt.   
 
f.
 
Individuals found to have intentionally and maliciously submitted a false report may be 
subject to appropriate administrative, civil or cr
iminal action.  
 
 
2.
 
Retaliation Prohibited:  Individuals who are found to have retaliated against any individual 
reporting or taking other action under this policy, including encouraging or  assisting another 
to report behavior of concern,  may be subject to
 
administrative, civil or criminal action as 
may be appropriate under the circumstances.   
 
 
3.
 
Establishment of the CARE Committee:  To facilitate implementation and administration of 
this policy, the Board of Regents formally recognizes and authorizes the C
onduct 
Assessment/Response, and Education (CARE) Committee as a standing university board, 
along with its subcommittee, the Behavioral Intervention Team.  
See 
Official List of 
University Boards
.
  
 
 
4.
 
Role of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team: The CARE Committee 
and Behavioral Intervention Team assess and coordinate response to reported behaviors of

concern that do not pose an immediate
 
threat of personal harm (to self or others), nor to 
property.  These committees have been established in part to facilitate the assembly of 
information from the distinct NMSU entities that may be privy to relevant information, in 
order to assist with the 
assessment for risk of harm. The CARE Committee defers to the 
Behavioral Intervention Team and other qualified professionals the decision making regarding 
the nature and type of appropriate responsive action. 
 
 
a.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Interve
ntion Team do not provide counseling 
or medical advice or services, but each may act to refer individuals to such internal or 
external resources, especially in situations involving victims of violence.  
 
b.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention T
eam are not responsible for 
responding to campus emergencies.  Emergency response is performed by the appropriate 
public safety entities (e.g. police or fire), with consequence management (continuity of 
operations and disaster recovery) addressed by the Ce
ntral Administration Response 

See
 
Policy 2.25
) 
However, the CART or other public safety professional may request information or 
assistance from either the
 
CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team as 
needed when responding to or managing an emergency. This provision is not intended to 
affect or otherwise limit the authority of the individual members of the Behavioral 
Intervention Team to act in the
ir professional capacity, or to take emergency medical 
action as permitted by state law.
 
c.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with other 
university offices and resources to publicize, throughout the NMSU system, the purpose 
and
 
functions of the committee and the protocols in place for reporting behavior of 
concern, including new employee and new student orientation at all campuses. 
 
d.
 
The members of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are 
authorized to obtain i
nformation pertaining to a matter pending review by the committee 
or team about individuals from supervisors of the NMSU entities and from students for 
relevant information; supervisors and students shall respond cooperatively and timely to 
such requests, 
for the benefit of the person involved as well as for that of the institution. 
 
e.
 
The Office of General Counsel provides legal counsel to the CARE Committee and the 
Behavioral Intervention Team, and is included in their meetings as an 
ex officio
 
member. 
 
f.
 
All
 
members of, as well as individuals involved with, proceedings of the CARE 
Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team shall maintain confidentiality at all times 
as required by law, including professional licensing standards regulated by the State of 
Ne
w Mexico.

Restrictive Access Policy
:  In or
der to establish an appropriate environment and preserve 
university
 
property for educational purposes, the 
university
 
reserves the right to restrict access to 
some of its lands and facilities.  Academic spaces are generally used for educational purposes 
on
ly, and buildings which serve as residences for students are restricted to students, their guests, 
and appropriate 
university
 
employees.  While some other 
university
 
facilities and grounds are 
available to the general public, activities must be scheduled a
nd authorized, and facilities/grounds 
must be used according to 
university
 
rules and regulations.  No individual(s), except for those 
contracted to reside on campus, shall temporarily or permanently remain overnight on the property 
of the 
Board of Regents
,
 
or dwell on the property of the 
board
, including but not limited to, in 
motor vehicles, or in temporary or permanent structures, without the specific prior approval of the 
vice president for student affairs and enrollment management
 
(or designee).  Member
s of the 
campus community, as well as visitors, are expected to behave in ways that do not interfere with 
the rights of others to pursue an education and/or do not disrupt community living on campus.  
Behaviors of any individuals that interfere with, disru
pt, impair, or obstruct the processes, 
procedures, or functions of the 
university
 
are prohibited.  
 
 
 
Failure to comply with this policy could subject the individual to warning, probation, 
and removal
 
from the campus, arrest, barring from the campus, or an
y other sanctions applicable under the

Principles
 
 
Both individual members of the 
university
 
and entities controlled by the 
university
 
have a vital need to 
recognize 
and deal with conflicts of interest and/or commitment.  Such conflicts may compromise or 
have the appearance of compromising the integrity of 
university
-
related activities and have unforeseen 
effects on those activities.  Even if there is no perceptible ef
fect on the activity, any apparent inability 
of the 
university
 
to avoid and/or resolve conflicts of interest invites outside criticism and supervision.  
Such supervision could result in the loss of the 

 
ability to decide its own direction.  
Con

for non
-
monetary self
-
interest.  Such conflicts may be personal or relate primarily to the institution or 
its constituent organizations or involve an individu
al whose behavior is inextricably linked with her or 
his official position, such as an upper
-
level administrator or a member of the 
Board of Regents
.  In any 
of these situations, the general principles remain the same; 1) disclose always, 2) manage when 
po
ssible; and 3) prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible.
 
 
A.
 
Disclose always:
  
It is vitally important that individuals provide a clear picture of their activities 
and complete forms accurately and in a factually correct manner so that pot
ential or actual 
conflicts of interest can be identified.  Similarly, if situations change, disclosure needs to be made 
within 15 working days 
(
see
 
section 3.20.
15
 
of this policy
).
  
The 
university
 
is under no obli
gation 
to manage, as opposed to prohibit, a conflict of interest disclosed by someone other than the 
individuals primarily involved.
 
 
B.
 
Manage when possible
:  The vast majority of conflicts can and are managed through removing at 
least one of the parties fro
m the conflict situation.  For example, an individual might recuse him or 
herself from the review process on a proposal, have another individual become principal 
investigator or abstain from participating in a particular promotion or tenure situation.  The
 
preference of the institution will be to provide management solutions to a conflict of interest that 
will remove or isolate the conflict.  However, such management is not possible when disclosure is 
not made.
 
 
C.
 
Prohibit when necessary and where management 
is not possible
:  In some few cases, it will not be 
possible to manage a conflict and the individual or organization will have to withdraw from the

activity.  In some cases, 
university
 
policy and/or state or federal law allows no solution other than 
prohib
ition.  For example, no member of the 
Board of Regents
 
may act as a vendor of goods or 
ser
vice
s to the 
university

]
 
 
It is the responsibility of all persons covered by this policy to report any real, apparent or potential 
conflict of interest or commitment to their sup
ervisor
s
. The primary means of doing this is through the 
completion of the Conflict of Interest Disclosure 
F
orm upon hire and on an annual basis, with 
disclosure updates submitted on the basis of changes in circumstance. Additional policies, as set forth 
i
n Section 
3.21.26
 
of this policy, are applicable to conflicts arising from 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities but are 
based upon the annual disclosure requirement.
 
 
A.
 
Procedure:
 
Each person covered by this policy is required
 
to complete, sign and submit a Conflict 
of Interest Disclosure form upon hire with any NMSU entity; as new conflicts arise during 
employment by NMSU; and on an annual basis as requested by 
the Office of 
Human Resource 
Ser
vice
s. 
Completed
 
forms will be 
rev
iewed and 
approved by the applicable 
supervisor (and only 
require next level supervisor review as defined below).  Disclosure forms submitted containing no 
conflicts require only one level of review and approval. Disclosure forms submitted containing 
one o
r more (real or perceived) conflicts of interest require two levels of review and approval. In 
addition, a plan to manage or eliminate the conflict(s) must be submitted. If a conflict of interest or 
commitment exists for which no 
management
 
plan is possibl
e, the supervisor is required to 
recommend a plan of action. Conflicts of interest and c
ommitment
 
that have been submitted may 
be reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as necessary. 
Maintenance of the form is the respon
sibility of the Office of Human Resource Ser
vice
s.
 
 
B.
 
Paths 
T
owards 
R
emedies:
 
There are two basic conditions that influence the path taken to remedy a 
conflict of interest or commitment. These may be summed up in the questions: 1) did the conflict 
arise a
s part of a sponsored activity? and 2) who disclosed the conflict? These questions must be 
asked together, as a conflict may be self
-
disclosed or disclosed by others and may or may not arise 
as part of a sponsored activity.
 
 
 
The first question that determ
ines disposition of conflicts of interest and/or commitment is 
whether or not the conflict arises from a sponsored activity. The treatment of conflicts in non
-
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities will follow normal personnel procedures as outlined in section 
4.05
 
and 
4.25
 
of the 
p
olicy 
m
anual, drawing informally on the ad
vice
 
of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest 
in Sponsored Activities as desired. Resolution of conflicts arising from 
s
ponsore
d 
a
ctivities shall 
be governed by the procedures set forth in section 
3.21.27
 
of this policy. The second question is 
whether the individual(s) involved in the conflict made the disclosure prospectively 
or as part of a 
timely update, or whether someone else has brought the conflict to the 

 
attention. In 
cases disclosed by the individual(s) having the conflict, the 
university
 
will generally try to manage 
the conflict in a manner agreeable to th
e parties involved and in agreement with applicable 
university
 
policies and state and federal laws. The person(s) identified as having the conflict may 
elect to manage the conflict by participating in measures that will guard the integrity of the 
situation
. Such measures require the approval of the relevant dean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
vice
 
provost
 
or (in the case of 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored 
Activities). The person(s) involved may choose or be told to withdraw fro
m the activity or 
situation that creates the conflict. In some cases, the supervisor and appropriate 
d
ean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
vice
 
provost
 
and, if applicable, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored 
Activities, shall approve the action taken. Wh
en someone other than the individual(s) involved in 
the conflict brings an existing conflict to the attention of the 
university,
 
the 
university
 
is under no 
obligation to try to remedy the conflict and may require that the individual(s) withdraw from the 
ac
tivity or situation creating the conflict. In addition, the individual(s) may be required to repay 
monies that have been obtained in a situation involving a conflict of interest or commitment. Other 
sanctions up to and including termination of an individua

to the appeals process outlined in sections 
4.05
 
and 
4.25
.

Policies for Specific Situations
 
 
3.20.32
 
Nepotism 
[
former Policy 4.45, renumbered
]
 
 
Members of a family may be employed by the 
university
 
except when one individual will di
rectly 
supervise the work of the other.  If one member of the family is to be employed in the same department 
as another, approval shall be obtained from the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
prior to any offer 
of employment.  Under no circumstances wil
l a supervisor evaluate a family member.
 
 
3.20.33
 
Faculty or Staff as Students
 
 
When a 
university
 
faculty or staff member enrolls in a program to earn a degree at the 
university,
 
a 
potential for conflict of interest may arise as a result of the dual role a
s student and as a faculty or staff 
member.  Persons in this status who are seeking degrees or certificates must demonstrate that the 
potential for conflict of interest will not compromise the quality of their program of study.  Approval 
of cognizant depar
tment heads and deans will be required.  In any case, supervisors should never have 
the responsibility of grading individuals whom they supervise.
 
 
In the case of graduate degrees or certificates, such programs must also be approved on a case
-
by
-
case 
basis
 
by the dean of the Graduate School with the concurrence of the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  When appropriate, the dean may confer with the Graduate Council about the potential for 
conflict of interest in such programs.  The graduate dean may req
uire a specific representative on such 
a graduate committee, possibly including off campus representatives, as a condition for approving 
programs.

Relatives and Significant Others as Students
 
 
Faculty of NMSU may not place themselves or be placed b

supervise, evaluate, teach or grade the work of members of their families enrolled in courses offered by 
the 
university
 
main campus and/or its community college campuses unless the cognizant department 
head and dean or 
equivalent approves a plan to manage the conflict.  The same regulation applies to 
individuals with whom the faculty member is in a consensual relationship (

Requests Made to Subordinates
 
 
In order to prevent individuals from being placed in a position of conflict between the needs of the 
institution and those of supervis
ors, persons in a position of supervisory authority over another 
individual may not ask that individual to perform duties that benefit the supervisor or a family member 
in a way that does not directly relate to the official duties of the employee or superv
isor.  An example 
of such a request would be for a supervisor, including a faculty member, to ask that a subordinate 
nominate the supervisor or anyone else for an award.  Another example might be suggesting that a 
subordinate purchase something to support

Conflicts of Interest and
 
Commitment in Sponsored Activities
 
 
Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment that arise from Sponsored Activities are of 
special concern because they almost always involve or implicate entities outside of the 
university
 
community (and thus 
are more prone to public scrutiny), are frequently governed not only by 
university
 
policies but also by governmental conflict
-
of
-
interest regulations and are subject to special

and policy statements set forth above in 
s
ections 
3.19
 
and 
3.20
 
apply also to this section

.  Specific 
guidance on conflicts of interest in 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities is set forth below.
 
 
3.21.21
 
Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Financial Interests
 
 
Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment in 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities gene
rally arise when an 
investigator or family member has a significant financial interest in, or a consulting arrangement with, 
a private business concern or other organization that is or may be affected by the sponsored activity.  
Some examples of this kind 
of conflict situation include, but are not limited to:
 
 

 
Engaging for sponsored research a business firm in which the investigator or family member 
involved in the research project has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Purchasing major equipment, instrument
s, materials or other items for sponsored research from a 
private firm in which the investigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Engaging a private consulting f
i
rm in connection with sponsored research where the investigator 
involved in such research has a consulting arrangement with or significant financial interest in a 
competing consulting f
i
rm.
 

 
Acceptance by an investigator involved in a sponsored research project of gratuities or special 
favors from a firm or other organi
zation with which the 
university
 
does business in connection 
with the sponsored research.
 

 
Utilization of privileged information acquired by an investigator in connection with sponsored 
research for personal gain, or to economically benefit a business conce
rn in which the investigator 
or family member has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Sponsorship of research by a business firm in which an investigator involved in the research has a 
significant financial interest.
 

 
In the absence of disclosure and express 
sponsor approval, employment of, or an offer of 
employment to, a family member of an investigator involved in sponsored research by either the 
sponsor of, or an organization engaged in, the research project.
 

 
Receipt by a family member of an investigator in
volved in a sponsored activity of a scholarship, 
fellowship, work/study benefit, or other financial aid, which is funded by or through the sponsored 
activity.
 
 
3.21.22
 
Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Personal Interest
 
 
An actual or percei
ved conflict of interest or commitment may also arise from situations that may have 
a significant impact on an investigator involved in sponsored research, even though the situation does 
not involve a significant financial interest.  These non
-
financial co
nflict situations frequently involve 
personal interests or relationships that are or may be affected by 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities.  Some examples 
are:
 
 

 

of the invest
igator acts as a non
-
paid advisor to, or board member of, the sponsoring entity.
 

 

human subject, student researcher or other non
-
paid participant.
 

 
An investigator

technology developed by a family member of the investigator.
 
 
3.21.24
 
Other Conflict Situations in Sponsored Activities
 
 
It is important to realize that any number of other 
kinds of conflict situations can arise in the context of 
sponsored projects, some of which may be undeterminable at the outset of the project.  Investigators 
involved in sponsored activities must be cognizant of the need to monitor project developments in 
order to identify potential or perceived conflict situations as they arise and to disclose them or facilitate 
their disclosure as soon as possible.  Examples of other kinds of conflict situations might include:
 
 

 

 
research project becomes so extensive during the 
course of the project that other obligations to the 
university
 
are neglected, thus creating a conflict

Governmental Conflict of Interest Regulations Concerning Sponsored Activities
 
 
Any research or other project that is sponso
red or funded by a governmental agency is likely to be 
subject to agency regulations or guidelines covering conflicts of interest as well as 
university
 
policies.  
The federal Office of Management and Budget has promulgated rules, applicable to all federall
y 
funded grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, which define conflicts of interest 
and the financial thresholds applicable to them and which require grant recipients to maintain written 
standards of conduct governing real or apparent 
conflicts of interest.  These rules are found in OMB 
Circular No. A
-
110, Sec. 42.  Most federal departments and independent agencies have formally 
adopted these rules and codified them in various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations.  A few 
agencies
 
have adopted supplementary conflict of interest guidelines applicable to their own grant 
administration procedures.  Two agencies, the National Science Foundation and the Public Health 
Ser
vice
, have established specific financial disclosure requirements a
nd disclosure review and conflict 
of interest management procedures applicable to grants from those agencies.  The guidelines and 
requirements set forth in this 
S
ection 
3.21
 
are intended to implement and comply wit
h these federal 
conflict of interest rules, so that compliance with this 
university
 
policy will generally assure 
compliance with governmental requirements.  Investigators are urged, however, to familiarize 
themselves with the conflict of interest rules ado
pted by agencies sponsoring their research activities.
 
 
3.21.26
 
Disclosure Procedures for Sponsored Activities
 
 
Each person engaged in an area of sponsored research and covered by this policy is responsible for 
determining whether any actual, potential or 
apparent conflict of interest or commitment exists
.
  
The 
principal investigator of each specific sponsored activity, in consultation with all other participants in 
the activity, is responsible for determining whether any possible conflicts exist with respe
ct to such 
activity and for so indicating on the New Mexico State

Committee Authority and 
Functions
:  
 
 
 
1.
 
T
he Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities 
shall meet as necessary to 
review all disclosure statements and 
decide in each instance whether:
 
 
a.
 
There is no potential conflict of interest; or
 
b.
 
There was a conflict of interest, which has since been resolved; or
 
c.
 
There is a conflict of interest that has not been resolved.
 
 
2.
 
In making these determinations, the committee,
 
at its discretion and under conditions of 
confidentiality, may seek the ad
vice
 
of additional persons. 
 
 
 
3.
 
The committee will exercise care at all times to ensure confidentiality and to protect the safety 
and privacy of persons involved in or affected by th
e review.  
 
 
4.
 
If the committee determines that there is an unresolved conflict of interest:
 
 
a.
 
The appropriate 
d
ean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
vice
 
provost
 
will be notified;
 
b.

inc
luding affected departmental personnel, to determine how the conflict should be 
managed so the sponsored activity can proceed if at all possible; and
 
c.
 
Acceptance of an award for the affected sponsored activity will be delayed pending 
resolution of the confl
ict.
 
 
5.
 
In order to effectively manage or remedy a conflict of interest, the committee may impose 
conditions or restrictions to control, reduce or eliminate the possibility that the conflict will 
affect the objectivity of the sponsored research or other acti
vity.  Examples of conflict of 
interest management options include:
 
 
a.
 
Public disclosure of the conflict.
 
b.
 
Divestiture of conflicting financial interests or placement in a blind trust.
 
c.
 
Escrow of a conflicting equity interest until appropriate triggering condi

Appeals from Decision Concerning Conflicts of Interest Arising from Sponsored 
Activities
 
 
 
 
A sponso
red activity may not be accepted in the event that the committee is unable to fashion a remedy 
for a specific conflict of interest and the conflict remains unresolved.  In such case, the Committee on 
Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities will notif

Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships
 
 
A.
 
Policy Statement:
  
It is the policy of the 
universi
ty
 
that employees with direct teaching, 
supervisory, advisory or evaluative responsibility over other employees, students and/or student 
employees recognize and respect the ethical and professional boundaries that must exist in such 
situations.  Consensual
 
relationships can create conflicts of interest that impair the integrity of 
academic and employment decisions.  Such relationships also contain the potential for exploitation 
of the subordinate employee, student or student employee and the possible profes
sional or 
academic disadvantage of third parties, and can subject both the 
university
 
and individuals to 
liabili
ty.  Therefore, the 
university
 
strongly discourages consensual relationships between 
supervisors and subordinates, teachers and students, and ad
visors and students.  Should such a 
relationship develop, the faculty member, supervisor or advisor has the obligation to disclose its 
existence to an immediate supervisor and cooperate in making alternative arrangements for the 
supervision, evaluation, te
aching, grading or advising of the employee, student or student 
employee.
 
 
 
B.
 
Scope:
  
This policy applies to all NMSU employees including faculty, staff and student 
employees.
 
 
 
C.
 
Definitions:
  
 
 
1.
 
A consensual relationship is a mutually acceptable, romant
ic and/or sexual relationship.
 
 
2.
 
A conflict of interest arises when an individual with the authority and responsibility to 
evaluate the work or performance of an employee, student or student employee acquiesces or 
engages in a consensual relationship with t
he employee or student. 
 
 
3.
 
An employee is defined as any individual, whether paid or not, who is listed and active on the 
university

s 
H
uman 
R
esources 
M
anagement System.  This includes all faculty, staff and 
student employees to include affiliated faculty a
nd associated employees.
 
 
D.
 
Reporting Responsibility:
  
In the event a conflict of interest exists arising from a consensual 
relationship, the individual in the supervisory, teaching or advisory position shall immediately 
notify 
the
 
supervisor 
about
 
the re
lationship and cooperate with the supervisor in making 
arrangements necessary to resolve the conflict of interest.  Notification of the
 
consensual
 
relationship shall be provided in writing and signed by both parties involved.
 
 
E.
 
Supervisor Responsibility
:
  
A supervisor who is notified shall take immediate steps to alter the 
conditions that create the conflict of interest caused by the relationship.  In most instances, this 
will be accomplished by providing an alternative means for the supervision, teaching
, advising 
and/or evaluation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee.  A supervisor who 
becomes aware of a consensual relationship that has not been 
declared
 
shall investigate and take 
action as appropriate and required by this policy.  Bo
th parties in the relationship and the 
supervisor shall sign the resolution.  All documentation will be maintained in a departmental file.  
 
 
F.
 
Failure to Report or Cooperate
:  Employees in positions of authority who enter into or continue 
consensual rela
tionships without reporting them, or who fail to cooperate in efforts to eliminate 
the conflict of interest resulting from a consensual relationship may be subject to disciplinary 
action, which may include counseling, letters of warning, reprimand, suspens
ion or termination.  
In the event that a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct is reported by the 
subordinate party regarding an unreported relationship, there will be no presumption that the 
relationship was consensual in nature.

While employees are encouraged to resolve p
ersonnel issues through discussion with the immediate 
supervisor(s), employees may contact the 
director of the Office of I
nstitutional 
E
quity/EEO
 
for 
consultation on discrimination matters at any time. If resolution is not attained, a formal or informal 
gr
ievance may be filed with the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
.  Employees shall be free to discuss 
matters with the 
director of the Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
and file grievances without fear of 
reprisal. 
 
 
A.
 
Hostile Work/Academic Environment
:  A 
student or employee may file a claim based on offensive 
conduct or behavior that is sufficiently severe and/or pervasive to create a hostile work or 
academic
-
related environment.  Non
-
discriminatory hostile environment issues are regarded 
management matter
s under the purview of the appropriate administrator.
 
 
B.
 
Discrimination
-
Based Harassment
: The 
university
 
prohibits any unlawful practice of harassment 

physical disabili
ty, gender, serious medical condition, national origin, race, religion, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, spousal affiliation, or veteran status.  Any supervisor who engages in 
or condones any harassment of an employee/student based on discrimination wi
ll be sanctioned 
accordingly.  All discrimination
-
based harassment, including third
-
party complaints, must be 
reported to the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO immediately.
 
 
C.
 
Retaliation
:  The

employee or student who has in good faith: (a) opposed any discriminatory 
or employment practice covered by 
university
 
policies/procedures or state/federal laws; (b) filed a 
complaint of discrimination or grievanc
e with the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
or external 
state/federal agency with statutory jurisdiction over discrimination filings; (c) reported a 
discriminatory matter to a supervisor; or, (d) testified, assisted with, or participated in an

result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
 
 
D.
 
Grievances
: Any person with a complaint of harassment or discrimination should, whenever 
possible, fir
st indicate to the person or persons engaging in the inappropriate conduct that the 
conduct is unwelcome.  If the inappropriate behavior persists, the aggrieved should either report 
the complaint to the appropriate supervisor or the 
director of the Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity/EEO.  All discrimination complaints made to a person in a position of authority must be 
reported immediately to the 
director of the Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO regardless of 
whether or not permission was given by the complain
ing party.  Discrimination grievances are to 
be filed within 15 working days of occurrence, unless extenuating circumstances warrant 
exception.  All employees and students should be aware that the 
university
 
is prepared to take 
action in a timely manner to
 
prevent and remedy such behavior, and that individuals who engage 
in such behavior are subject to disciplinary action.  All individuals are required to cooperate with 
any investigation in response to an allegation of harassment.  Refusal to cooperate in a
n 
investigation may result in disciplinary action in accordance with 
university
 
policy.  Any 
disciplinary action may be appealed through the appropriate procedure.  To the extent possible, 
every effort will be made to safeguard confidentiality, consistent 
with reporting obligations and 
the need to investigate promptly and thoroughly.  Individuals should contact the following offices 
for clarification or assistance:

The 
university
 
is dedicated to providing reasonable accommodation to qua
lified 
university
 
employees 
and 
applicants for positions in accordance with state and federal law
s.  Qualified individuals with 
disabilities are protected from discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, job training, fringe 
benefits, and other aspects of employment.  Accessibility to buildings, programs, and ser
vice
s will also 
be safeguarded
 
to the extent that an undue financial hardship is not imposed on the 
university
.  The 
accommodation process begins when an employee (or applicant) discloses a disability and requests 
specific accommodation(s).  Under normal circumstances, requests for acc
ommodation(s) are 
considered after the employee completes and processes the Petition for Accommodation Form 
available at the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
.
 
 
3.31
 
 
Distribution of Effort
 
 
There are competing demands on the energies of a faculty member 
(for instance, research, teaching, 
committee work, outside consulting).  The way in which a faculty member divides effort among these 
various functions does not raise ethical questions unless the 
university
 
or government, industrial, or 
business agency sup
porting the research is misled in its understanding of the amount of intellectual 
effort actually devoted to the research in question.  A system of precise time accounting is 
incompatible with the inherent character of the work of a faculty member, since t
he various functions 
performed are closely interrelated and do not conform to any meaningful division of a standard work 
week.  On the other hand, if the research agreement contemplates that a staff member will devote a 
certain fraction of effort to the go
vernment, industrial, or business
 
sponsored research, a demonstrable 
relationship between the indicated effort of responsibility and the actual extent of involvement is to 
be
 
expected.  Research administering agencies in the 
university
 
have established sim
ple procedures of 
accounting which indicate the proportion of the investigator's time spent on sponsored research.  Each 
administering agency will inform the investigator of the procedures developed to assure that proposals 
are responsibly made and complie
d with.

-
 
Political Activity
 
and 
3.92
-
Sales and 
Solicitation
)
 
 
The 
univers
ity
 
recognizes and promotes an intellectually open campus.  The free exchange of ideas 
through written, spoken, and other forms of expression reflects its public land
-
grant heritage, support 
of diverse points of view, and commitment to excellence in educat
ion and research.
 
 
A.
 
Campus Use for Free Expression
:  Any outdoor area that is generally accessible to the public may 
be used by any individual or group for petitioning, distributing written material, handing out 
newspapers, or conducting speech acts.  Pr
ior approval is not necessary as long as the primary 
action is not to advertise or sell a commercial product.  Activities must follow all applicable fire 
codes, local, state, and federal laws.  Activities shall not:
 
 
1.
 
Unreasonably obstruct vehicular or pede
strian traffic.
 
 
 
2.
 
Block the entrances or exits to buildings and facilities.
 
 
3.
 
Permanently occupy land areas or permanently locate signs and posters.
 
 
4.
 
Erect permanent structures, shelters or camps.
 
 
5.
 
Unreasonably interfere with classes, 
university
 
work, and s
cheduled events.
 
 
In exercising the right of free expression, an individual must also accept the responsibility of 
following the laws related to the safety of people and property.  If property damage or excessive 
littering occurs, or other unusual expenses
 
are incurred by the 
university
 
as a result of the event, 
event organizers may be held responsible for reasonable charges if deemed appropriate by the 
president
 
(or designee).
 
 
B.
 
Petitioning and the Distribution and Posting of Literature and Signs
:  All l
iterature distributed 
must contain identifying information (either the name of a 
university
 
sanctioned organization; the 
name and address, which may be an organization and e
-
mail address, of the unaffiliated entity or 
person; or the telephone number of the
 
unaffiliated entity or person) for someone to contact in case 
of litter problems.  Literature may be distributed hand
-
to
-
hand, through the use of tables, or by 
posting on designated bulletin boards and kiosks.  Written materials may not be placed in non
-
a
pproved locations.  Written materials may not be placed on any part of a 
university
 
building or 
structure without 
university
 
permission.  Posting on traffic signs, power poles, trees, and 
automobile windshields is not allowed.  Tables are allowed as long a
s the tables do not 
unreasonably interfere with pedestrian traffic.  Materials may not be left on unattended tables.  
While scheduling of tables is not required in advance, those individuals who have previously 
scheduled a site through the 
c
ampus 
a
ctivitie
s 
o
ffice or other appropriate 
university
 
offices will 
take precedent. 
 
 
C.
 
Group Speech Activities
:  Group speech activities, including rallies, parades and demonstrations 
that are advertised through public media including newspapers, radio, television, fl
yers, or 
electronic lists may need to be coordinated through the 
university
 
p
olice 
d
epartment.  Any 
individual, group, or organization sponsoring a group speech activity that is expected to draw 
more than 100 persons at one time and uses public media for a
dvertising must notify the 
NMSU
 
P
olice Department no less than 72 hours in advance of the activity, so that the 
NMSU
 
Police 
Department can take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the event and issue a permit as 
proof of prior notification.  Activi
ties expected to draw 500 or more participants, or require road 
closures or detours, must be scheduled 2 weeks in advance. Any individual, group, or organization 
planning a group speech activity is encouraged to contact the 
c
ampus 
a
ctivities 
o
ffice in adva
nce 
so that activities may be coordinated with appropriate 
university
 
offices.  This will allow for 
locations to be reserved or other concerns to be addressed, such as the use of sound amplification 
equipment.  Contacting the 
Department of 
Campus Activitie
s is voluntary and does not constitute 
an approval process.  All scheduling is done on a first come, first serve basis.  Activities that are

Protection of Sensitive Information
 
[
New Policy recommended
 
by Administrative Council 
09.13.11; 
a
pproved by Board of Regents 10.10.11]
 
 
Certain informat
ion generated by the operations of the various university colleges and other units is 
sensitive in nature, and requires a heightened level of protection to ensure its confidentiality.  
Examples of sensitive information included, but are not limited to:  cl
assified information, controlled 
unclassified information, and proprietary information.  
 
 
A.
 
 
Definitions

1.
 
Classified information refers to information owned by, produced by or for, or is under control 
of the United States Government 
specifically authorized
 
under criteria established by an 
Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret
; unauthorized disclosure, either by 
itself or in context with other information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to 
national security, including defense 
against transnational terrorism. 
 
 
2.
 
Controlled unclassified information refers to information that loss, misuse, unauthorized 
access or disclosure, or modification thereof could cause harm to important interests, such as 
personal or medical privacy to which
 
individuals are entitled under laws, national security, 
law enforcement, proprietary commercial rights, or the conduct of government agency 
programs. Controlled unclassified information includes, but not is limited to, information 
designated by a federal 

identifiable information generated in research approved by the Institutional Review Board, 
and information protected by the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the 
Export Administra
tion Regulations (EAR), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), the Gramm

supplementing the various 
programs in teaching, research, extra

curricular, and ser
vice
 
activities.  The 
university
 
recognizes and encourages the efforts of campus groups in this 
regard, but also recognizes the necessity to establish guidelines which aid in coordinating 
these activ
ities to avoid conflicts, duplication, violation of laws or regulations, or activities 
which reflect negatively on the 
university.

organization meetings off campus.  These methods are often over
-
used 
and may be counterproductive.  Caution is also advised in the repetitious solic

)  
 
 
It is the policy of New Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
t
o provide an atmosphere free of sexual harassment for 
all faculty, staff, students, and visitors.
 
 
According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Office for Civil 
Rights, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, an
d other verbal or physical conduct of 
a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either 
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual

s employment or academic progress; (2) 
students

 
educational
 
pursuits are adversely impacted; (3) submission to or rejection of such conduct 
by an individual is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting such individual; 
(4) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering wi
th an individual

s academic or 
work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or learning environment.  
Harassing conduct based on gender often is sexual in nature, but sometimes is not.  Any unwelcome 
conduct based on gender i
s also forbidden by this policy regardless of whether the individual engaged 
in harassment and the individual being harassed are of the same or different gender.  Common forms of 
harassment include offensive or abusive physical contact, joking, lewd langua
ge, suggesting sexual 
favors, displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, magazines, calendars, etc. 
 
 
A.
 
Hostile Work/Academic Environment
:  A student or employee may file a claim based on sexually 
offensive conduct that is sufficiently severe and/o
r pervasive to create a hostile work or academic 
environment.  A hostile work or academic environment based on unwelcome attention, leers, or 
remarks of a sexual nature may also be grounds for sexual harassment. The 
university
 
extends this 
protection to st
udents in the classroom or in any academic
-
related settings.  Hostile environment 
harassment based on discrimination should be referred to the 
director of the Office of 
Institutional 
Equity/EEO
.  Non
-
discriminatory hostile environment issues are regarded m
anagement matters 
under the purview of the appropriate administrator.
 
 
B.
 
Retaliation
: Any 
university
 
employee or student may report violations of this policy without fear 
of retribution.  The 
university
 
prohibits retaliation against individuals because th
ey have in good 
faith:  (1) opposed any discriminatory or employment practice covered by 
university
 
policies/procedures or state/federal laws; (2) filed a complaint of discrimination or grievance with 
the 
Office of Institutional Equity/EEO 
or external stat
e/federal agency with statutory jurisdiction 
over discrimination filings; (3) reported a discriminatory matter to a supervisor; or, (4) testified, 
assisted with, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing protected under same.

Such retali
ation in and of itself may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
 
 
C.
 
Grievances
: Persons who feel they have been harassed should whenever possible first approach 
the person or persons engaging in the inappropriate conduct indicati
ng that the conduct is 
unwelcome.  If the unwelcome behavior persists, the aggrieved should either report the complaint 
to the appropriate supervisor or the 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
director
.  All sexual harassment 
complaints made to a person in a position
 
of authority must be reported to the 
director of the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
(or the human resource ser
vice
s
 
director
 
if uncomfortable 
reporting the complaint to the 
director or the Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
) immediately, 
regardless of
 
whether or not permission was given by the party subjected to the harassment.  
Allegations of sexual harassment are to be reported within 15 working days of occurrence, unless 
extenuating circumstances warrant exception.  All employees and students should
 
be aware that 
the 
university
 
is prepared to take action in a timely manner to prevent and remedy such behavior, 
and that individuals who engage in such behavior are subject to disciplinary action.  Any 
disciplinary action may be appealed through the appro
priate procedure.  To the extent possible, 
every effort will be made to safeguard confidentiality, consistent with reporting obligations and 
the need to investigate promptly and thoroughly.  Contact

D.
 
Sanctions
: Individuals who engage in sexual harassment, or supervisors who neglect to control the 
work environment and/or learning environment, will be held accountable.  If 
it is determined that a 
violation of this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary action, training, and other measures 
will be taken to remedy the situation.  All individuals are required to cooperate with any 
investigation in response to an allegati
on of harassment.  Refusal to cooperate in an investigation 
may result in disciplinary action in accordance with 
university
 
policy.

appropriate.

Grievance Resolution [30 days]:  Prior to initiation of any grievance, the faculty 
member has 30 days from the date of action or inaction giving rise to the grievance to 
inform the department head or other administrator not dir

an attempt to discuss and resolve.  A faculty advisor may be chosen at this stage or later 
by the grievant to assist, or appointed on behalf of the faculty member, upon request. (

Formal Hearing [30 days or less]:  If mediation fails to produce a mutual agreement for 
resolution, the Faculty Grievance Review Board hearing panel conducts an administrative 
hearing within 20 days; the board  forwards factual findings, t
he grievance record, and 
recommendations to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost within 10 
days from hearing.

grievant.  If the aggrieved faculty m
ember requests assistance in obtaining an advisor, the 
Faculty Senate Chair or designee shall appoint a senior faculty member to serve in that 
capacity.
 
 
3.
 
Stay of Proceedings:  With the concurrence of the Office of the General Counsel, a grievance 
may be st
ayed by the chair of the Faculty Grievance Review Board when the grievant is also 
seeking relief based upon the same set of facts in another forum, or agrees to explore 
alternative dispute resolution outside the scope of this policy.  The matter may be re
-
opened, 
if appropriate, depending upon the outcome of the other proceeding.  Any party may submit a 
written request to the chair of the Faculty Grievance Review Board that a particular grievance 
be stayed.
 
 
4.
 
Confidentiality:  All university personnel shall 
maintain and preserve confidentiality 
regarding faculty grievance matters, particularly matters discussed or divulged in a

Fair and Impartial Mediation and Hearing Process:  Faculty members are entitled to
 
a fair and 
impartial review of their claims. This includes the prompt resolution of actual or perceived 
conflicts of interest:
 
 
a.
 
Conflicts Guidelines:
 
 
i.
 
Under no circumstances will a Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing 
panel member participat
e in a hearing convened to hear a grievance from a person 
with whom the member has a familial, personal or close professional relationship.  A 
Faculty Grievance Review Board member shall not mediate, nor hear, a matter 
involving faculty from their own NMSU
 
entity.
 
ii.
 
If one or more of the witnesses has a close relationship with one of the hearing panel 
members, disqualification of the hearing panel member from service shall not be 
automatic, but shall be decided based upon the specific facts of each case.
 
iii.
 
If t
he grievant or a witness has had prior contact with either the assigned mediator or 
a hearing panel member, disqualification or the mediator or panel member from 
service shall not be automatic, but shall be decided based upon the specific facts of 
each cas
e.
 
 
b.
 
Early Disclosure of Conflict/Voluntary Recusal:
 
 
i.
 
Any Faculty Grievance Review Board member selected to serve as either the 
mediator or as a member of the hearing panel in a grievance matter shall disclose 
actual and potential conflicts of interest imme
diately or as soon as it is realized, in 
order that it may resolved prior to the informal or formal grievance processes.
 
ii.
 
A party shall also raise the issue of an actual or potential conflict of interest on the 
part of a mediator or hearing board member as 
soon as the conflict is known.
 
iii.
 
After consideration of the relevant facts and positions of the parties, if it is 
determined that a conflict exists sufficient to call into question the impartiality of the 
Faculty Grievance Review Board member, the resolution
 
will be either voluntary 
recusal by the member of the Faculty Grievance Review Board alleged to have the 
conflict, or by substitution of a different member by the chair of the Faculty 
Grievance Review Board.
 
 
c.
 
Process to Resolve Alleged Conflict of Interes
t:  In the event a conflict of interest issue is 
raised and not resolved amicably by substitution of another board member, the chair of 
the Faculty Grievance Review Board, the mediator or the hearing panel chair, as 
appropriate, shall give notice of the po
tential conflict to the parties and proceed to resolve 
the issue as expeditiously as possible.
 
 
i.
 
If a challenged Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel member 
agrees that the conflict is sufficient to render the member unable to participat
e in a 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

fair and impartial manner, the member shall be excused from further participation.
 
ii.
 
If the challenged Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel 
member disagrees that there is a conflict sufficient to affect impartiality, the matter 
wil
l be decided by the chair of the Faculty Senate.
 

 
Each party may provide their position on the issue, and to comment on the 
position of the other party.  Other evidence may be considered if relevant or 
needed to decide the issue; however, the parties are en
titled to know and 
comment on any other evidence considered by the chair of Faculty Senate in 
making the decision.
 

 
If a Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel member is 
excused based on a finding of conflict of interest, another Faculty G
rievance 
Review Board member shall be selected to serve.
 
 
6.
 
Time Deadlines 
(See Also Section H. for time limit to initiate grievance)

expeditiously as possible.
 
b.

7.
 
Filing and Storage of Grievance/Hearing Records:  The Faculty Senate Chair, together with 
the Offices of HRS, with guidance from the Office of General Couns
el as needed, shall ensure 
that the official grievance record documentation (consisting of official grievance, any written 
response, official correspondence, evidence submitted for hearing and final decision but NOT 
INCLUDING anything from an unsuccessful 
mediation session) is maintained as follows:
 
 
a.
 
The grievance record is typically voluminous, and shall not be filed in the official 
personnel file, but will be housed in a grievance file with the Office of Human Resource 
Services.  Occasionally, it may be a
ppropriate to file or to cross reference a grievance 
decision
 
in the official personnel file (i.e. to justify a mandated change in salary).
 
b.
 
If the grievant prevails on an issue affecting a document contained in the official 
personnel file, that document wi
ll be revised and the original document will be moved to 
the grievance file, to document compliance with the decision on the grievance.
 
c.
 
Copies of the final administrative decision, which may be a Mediation Agreement, shall 
be stored permanently in the Offi
ce of the Executive Vice President and Provost.
 
d.
 
The grievance record, consisting of official correspondence and notifications, exhibits 
and other evidence, recordings, factual findings, and final decision, shall be maintained 
by the Office of Human Resourc

of records policy.
 
 
8.
 
Prohibition of Retaliation:  Retaliation against any person that attempts dispute resolution in 
accordance with this policy, including the pre
-
grievance stage, and/or against tho
se who may 
be called upon to advise, cooperate, testify, investigate, counsel, mediate or adjudicate matters 
under this policy is strictly prohibited.  Any such claim shall be reported immediately to the 
Assistant Vice President of Human Resource Services.
  
Such claims will be taken seriously, 
investigated independently, and if substantiated, will be grounds for corrective or disciplinary 
action, appropriate to the circumstances.

Procedures to Initiate Grievance:
  
After internal communications between ind
ividuals with 
authority to resolve the grievance have failed to resolve a disagreement or dispute that has been 
identified to the department head as a potential grievance, a faculty member may initiate a formal 
grievance by delivering a memo with the subje

Faculty Grievance Review Board, through the Faculty Senate chair. A copy shall also be delivered 
by the grievant to the department head, cognizant dean or equivalent administrator, and assistant 
vice preside
nt of human resource services.  Throughout grievance proceedings, communications 
between one party and any member of the Faculty Grievance Review Board shall be copied to the 
other party as well as the assistant vice president of human resource services. E
xamples include 
requests for extensions of time and the responses thereto, supplemental submittals if permitted, 
notices of appeal. The grievance should be initiated within thirty (30) days from the date of the 
action or inaction being grieved, or from the
 
time the faculty member reasonably should have 
known about the action/inaction subject of the grievance. This time limit for submitting a 
grievance will be interpreted liberally in order to encourage informal resolution. The chair of 
Faculty Senate may al
so grant, in writing to all parties, an extension of the deadline, for 
extenuating circumstances, or if so doing facilitates pre
-
grievance resolution.  The memo initiating 
the grievance resolution process shall:
 
 
1.
 
Identify the issue in dispute;
 
 
2.
 
Identify in
volved parties and provide email and physical address of the grievant to which 
official grievance correspondence should be sent;
 
 
3.
 
Identify efforts made to date to resolve dispute;
 
 
4.
 

points contra;
 
 
5.
 
Attach or reference any supporting documentation; and
 
 
6.
 
State the remedy requested.
 
 
I.
 
Procedures to Determine Jurisdiction:
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board Chair shall convene a 
quorum of the board to review the grievance and determine whe
ther or not the matter(s) alleged 
state a grievable claim within the purview of this policy. Typically, the Faculty Grievance Review 
Board Chair will issue the official correspondence to the parties; however, as agreed by the 
members, any member may issue 
the written determination to the grievant on behalf of the Faculty 
Grievance Review Board, provided it is reflective of what the majority decided.  The 
determination to accept or decline a grievance shall be issued in writing to all parties within ten 
days
 
from the date the grievance was received by the Faculty Grievance Review Board Chair.  A 

-
EMS 

etermination may be 
appealed by either party within three days from receipt to Assistant Vice President of Human 
Resource Services, who will issue a written decision letter sent to all parties within five days from 
receipt of the appeal.
 
 
J.
 
Procedures for In
formal Resolution/Mediation:
 
The purpose of the mediation phase of this 
grievance procedure is to explore whether or not mediation or other alternate method of dispute 
resolution might resolve the grievance and obviate the need for the formal hearing and d
ecision 
making process.
 
 
1.
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board member selected (
See Section F. 5.
)  to coordinate the 
mediation  phase of the grievance may serve as mediator, or, if warranted by the facts alleged 
or the parties involved, and with the approval
 
from the Faculty Grievance Review Board 
chair, may utilize a mediator external to the Faculty Grievance Review Board to conduct the 
pre
-
hearing dispute resolution (mediation) phase of the grievance process.
 
 
2.
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator may
 
conduct the mediation jointly with an 
external mediator; may rely on external mediator(s) to conduct the mediation; and may 
require that more than one mediation session be held.

The Emergency Action Committee 
will elect its own chair.  Once convened for an exigency, the 
voting committee members will continue to serve until the exigency has ended, ev
en though their 
original office may have been refilled.  The 
president
 
will present the financial records and 
supporting data for the exigency to
 
the Emergency Action Committee
 
and will ask the managers 
of appropriate administrative units to prepare plans 
for achieving their share of the necessary 
reductions in expenditures.  These plans should include a detailed discussion of the probable 
effects of the actions proposed.  The 
president
 
will present these plans to the Emergency Action 
Committee and seek the
 
ad

of the Emergency Action Committee before making a decision on 
future action.  The Emergency Action Committee will analyze these data and plans, for

B.
 
Non I&G Unit Exigency
:  Ind
ividual units within the general I
 
&
 
G budget cannot be declared in 
financial exigency separate from a 
university
 
wide exigency.  However, should the 
president
 
of the 
university
 
believe that a financial exigency threatens any individual unit funded by stat
e 
appropriated line items outside of the main campus I
 
&
 
G, the 
president
 
will ask the ad
vice
 
of the 
unit manager and will convene the Emergency Finance Committee and seek its ad
vice
.  After 
receiving the ad
vice
 
of the Emergency Finance Committee, the 
pres
ident
 
will consult with the 
board
.  The 
board
, after receiving the committee report and the recommendation of the 
president
, 
will decide whether to declare a financial exigency.  If the 
board
 
declares a unit financial 
exigency, the 
president
 
will convene a
 
Unit Emergency Action Committee.  The size of each Unit 
Emergency Action Committee will be determined by the 
president
, but it will be large enough to 
provide adequate representation for the personnel employed within the unit.  Voting members of 
each Unit
 
Emergency Action Committee shall be members of the unit, appointed by either the 
Committee on Committees of the Faculty Senate or the 
NMSU Employee Council
, depending on 
the primary functions of the unit, as determined by the 
president
.  In addition, the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
administration and finance
,
 
the chair of the Faculty Senate, the
 
director of the human 
resource ser
vice
s
, or their designees and others as may be appointed by the 
president
, shall serve 
as nonvoting 
ex officio
 
members.  The Unit E
mergency Action Committee shall elect its own 
chair.  The voting members of the Unit Emergency Action Committee shall continue to serve until 
the exigency has ended.  Should a voting member leave the 
university
 
community, 
that member
 
will be replaced by ap
pointment by the original appointing body.  The unit manager will present a 
plan for meeting the exigency to the 
president
 
and the Unit Emergency Action Committee.  The 
Unit Emergency Action Committee will analyze the plan, estimate its possible effects, f
ormulate 
recommendations, and report to the 
president
 
and the unit manager.  If the 
president
 
believes that 
the plan will have a substantial impact on the 
university
 
as a whole, the 
president
 
will convene the 
Emergency Finance Committee and ask its ad
vice
 
on declaration of a 
university
 
wide financial 
exigency.  After receiving the final recommendations of the Unit Emergency Action Committee,

the 
president
 
will consult with the 
board
.  The 
board
, after reviewing the Unit Emergency Action 
Committee recommenda
tions, will determine the procedures to be followed to end the financial 
exigency.
 
 
C.
 
Termination of a Financial Exigency
:  It is the joint responsibility of the 
president
 
and the 
Emergency Finance Committee to monitor closely the 

 
financial s
ituation throughout 
the duration of the financial exigency.  It is the responsibility of the 
president
 
to inform the 
university
 
community on a regular basis of the 

 
financial situation.  If the 
president
 
in 
consultation with the Emergency Finan
ce Committee should determine that a financial crisis no 
longer exists, a recommendation that the financial exigency be terminated shall be submitted by 
the 
president
 
to the 
Board of Regents
. A state of financial exigency will cease to exist upon its 
termi
nation by the 
board
.  The 
president
 
will so inform the 
university
 
community of the decision 
of the 
board
.
 
 
D.
 
Minor Financial Shortfall
:  In a period of minor financial shortfall in which no financial exigency 
has been declared, the 
university
 
may respond 
on an ad hoc basis the first year.  If it seems the 
financial shortfall might last a second year, the 
president
 
should consider convening the 
Emergency Finance Committee during the first year.  In such a case, whether or not a financial 
exigency is declare
d, planning should begin well before the end of the first year that will entail use 
of program review information to make decisions for program reductions that could be partially 
implemented during the second year.  If minor financial shortfall continues f
or 2 or more years, 
increasing reliance should be placed on planned program reductions.
 
 
E.
 
Policies for Declared Exigency and Minor Financial Shortfall
:  The following policies will guide 
the Emergency Action Committee, the unit managers, and the 
presiden
t
 
in their decisions:
 
 
F.
 
General
:  The primary consideration behind all decisions will be to maintain viable, quality, and 
logically defensible programs in keeping with the land
-
grant mission of the 
university.
  
An attempt 
will be made to maintain a core 
university
 
consisting of the historic components necessary for a 
broad
-
based liberal education. An appropriate balance among faculty, administrative and support 
personnel will be maintained. An appropriate balance among teaching, research, and ser
vice
 
func
tions of the 
university
 
will be maintained.  Financially self
-
supporting units will generally be 
given priority status.
 
 
G.
 
Human Res
ources Policies
:  Prior to any layoffs, personnel will be asked to indicate their desires 
with respect to early retirement,
 
part
-
time employment, voluntary resignation, and intra
-
university
 
transfer.  The 
university
 
shall, to the extent the 
Board of Regents
 
determines practicable, make a 
good faith effort to relocate any employee subject to layoff in a suitable vacant position
 
within the 
university
 
for which that employee is fully qualified.  This good faith effort to relocate an 
employee need not extend beyond the effective date of the layoff.  Salary reductions should not be 
used as a means of meeting financial exigency unles
s other options have been considered by the 
board
.  When programmatic decisions have been made and faculty within a given program are to 
be laid off, where the 
board
 
so determines, and consistent with program need, nontenure
-
track 
faculty will receive lowe
st priority, followed by tenure
-
track faculty, then by tenured faculty.  
Within each of these categories, layoffs will be based on program need, seniority, and 
performance.  Once areas have been identified in which 
staff
 
employees are at risk because of 
fi
nancial exigency, probationary employees will be considered for 
layoff first.  Other layoffs of
 
staff, if necessary, will be based upon seniority and performance within those job classifications or 
job titles identified.  Specific plans for any area affect
ed by financial exigency will be prepared by 
the unit manager in accordance with the established 
university
 
guidelines before any actions are 
taken.  Employees who are to be laid off may appeal.  (
See
 
Grievances
)
  
Following layoffs due to 
financial exigency, if programmatically defensible, former employees will be considered for rehire 
prior to new hires for a period to be set by the 
university
 
administration.

Faculty Senate Review of Proposed Program Eliminatio
n or Reorganization
:  For the purposes of 
this policy, a program is defined as a department, an undergraduate major, a graduate degree 
program, or
 
any other administrative unit composed of or affecting academic personnel, personnel 
on continuous contract, 
or tenure
-
track faculty.  A possible result of program review or financial 
exigency may be the proposal to reorganize and/or eliminate one or more programs.  The time

constraints imposed upon the implementation of program reorganization or elimination will
 
therefore vary.  In this context, program reorganization is meant to involve actions more 
significant than the transfer or elimination of one or very few positions.  Consistent with policies 
regarding the approval processes for creation of new academic pr
ograms or name changes (and 
considering such time constraints as may be imposed by financial exigency)
;
 
an opportunity shall 
be provided for the Faculty Senate to hear the arguments for and/or against proposed program 
elimination or reorganization.  The Fa
culty Senate will then register a vote of agreement or 
disagreement to the proposed program elimination or reorganization, and report this result (with 
rationale and minority reports, if any) to the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
, and the 
E
xecutive
 
R
eview 
B
oard
.  After receiving and reviewing all relevant information and reports, the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
will render a decision with respect to program elimination or 
reorganization, which will be final.  Individual employees affected by 
program elimination or 
reorganization may appeal decisions concerning their positions according to the releva
nt policies 
of this manual.

Outside Employment and/or Activities 
(
See
 
also
 
Chapter 3 Codes of Cond
uct 
-
Conflict of 
Interest
)
 
 
Employees may not engage in outside business activities while on duty.  Violation of this provision 
may be grounds for involuntary termination.  Employees holding a part or full
-
time 
s
econd job should 
not allow such employment 
to interfere with their performance or attendance.  If the supervisor can 
reasonably demonstrate that performance or attendance problems are resulting from outside 
employment, the supervisor may ask the employee to terminate such employment.  If the employ
ee 
refuses to do so, the employee may be terminated.

The policy of the 
Board of Regents
 
is that faculty and staff h
ave the same citizens' rights as other 
people.  However, employees seeking elective office or serving in an elective office must not allow 
campaign and ser
vice
 
activities to interfere with 
university
 
responsibilities.  Employees elected to the 
state legisl
ature will be placed on leave without pay during the term of such office.  Any possible 
conflict of interest shall be reported by the employee or by any other concerned employee to the 
administration through the appropriate channels.  Unresolved issues sha

Supplemental Employment/Compensation
 
 
A.
 
Policy Permitting Supplemental Compensation
:  
Supplemental compensation may be paid 
to 
faculty 
and staff acting in the capacity of a professional/faculty employee for an additional 
assignment performed during normal 
university
 
working hours, providing that assignment is (1) 
clearly outside the scope of that person

s regular tea
ching, rese
arch
 
and ser
vice
 
responsibilities; 
and 
(2) does not interfe
re with those responsibilities. 
 
Such time will be counted against a faculty 
member

s allowed consulting time and must be approved in advance by all cognizant 
administrators, including the 
executiv
e
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  Additional compensation is 
submitted for approval by the completion of an 
E
-
Hire Form
.  This compensation may be 
authorized in addition to regular salary for those employees exempt from overtime provisions of 
the Fair Labor S
tandards Act and is used to authorize payment for consulting, workshops, etc.  
Supplemental compensation will not be paid solely on the basis that the salary has been budgeted 
into the agreement.
 
 
B.
 
Supplemental Employment Guidelines
:  
 
 
1.
 
Applicable only to
 
f
aculty, or those staff acting in the capacity of a professional/faculty 
employee.
 
 
2.
 
Applicable only to employees currently employed during the period when the supplemental 
compensation was earned.
 
 
3.
 
The rate of pay should not exceed the employee

s current ra
te of pay in the employee

s 
primary job assignment.  Under those special circumstances where a request exceeds the 

 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
and 
P
rovost
 
must be attached t
o the form.  Hours worked (a) should 
not exceed a reasonable percentage of full
-
time hours (Any percentage greater than 50 percent 
must be justified in an attached memo); (b) must be properly documented per grant/contract 
requirements.
 
 
4.
 
Only in unusual 
cases may an exempt staff and faculty member be paid to work on a grant or 
contract, as consultants or otherwise, if that effort results in payment in excess of 100 percent 
FTE unless specifically provided for, as supplemental compensation, in the agreemen
t or 
approved in writing by the sponsoring agency.  For federal grants and contracts, approval will 
normally be granted only if two conditions exist:
 
 
a.
 
The work is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote location; and
 
b.
 
The work performed b
y the employee is in addition to 
the 
regular departmental workload.

Academic Freedom
 
 
The quest for truth often leads the scholar into difficult and untried territory.  As a dealer in ideas, the 
teacher or researcher comes often in conflict with prevailing be
lief of large segments of society and 
even with those of colleagues.  Yet, because of the practical benefits of scholarly activity, it is 
profoundly important that this diversity of ideas be not only tolerated, but encouraged.  The right to 
support unortho
dox positions, arrived at through scholarly investigation, free from coercion or 
reprisals, is fundamental to the continued progress of society.  The right to pursue unpopular lines of 
inquiry and express new and unaccepted ideas falls within the framework
 
of a special set of guarantees 
called academic freedom.  In granting these guarantees, society expresses a willingness to risk the 
consequences because history confirms that the risk is outweighed by the benefits stemming from such 
a policy.  Scholars are
 
entitled to full freedom in the conduct of their research and publication of the 
results, and full freedom in the classroom to discuss those topics in which they are professionally 
experts as determined by their credentials.  The exercise of this freedom 
carries with it the burden of 
corollary responsibilities.  Scholars must not knowingly misrepresent facts.  They must be careful in 
their teaching not to introduce controversial matter bearing no relationship to their subjects.  They must 
exercise appropri
ate restraint and guard against distortions and inaccuracies.  Outside their academic 
roles, as private citizens, scholars have no special privileges.  When they speak or write as citizens, 
they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, b
ut their special position in the 
community imposes special obligations.  As persons of learning and educational officers, they should 
remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances.  Hence 
they should at all t
imes be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the 
opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the 
institution.  Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common
 
good and not to further the 
interest of either the individual scholar or the institution as a whole. The 
Board of Regents
 
recognizes 
that it is not possible to define, with any great precision, the limits of academic freedom in the complex 
world of ideas.
  
The gray areas are practically endless and the final judgment of what is acceptable and 
reasonable must be left by society to the academic community itself.  The scholar's own colleagues and 
institution must bear the brunt of public criticism, have the m
ost to lose from withdrawal of public 
trust, and are, therefore, in the best position to balance the issues of academic freedom and 
responsibility.

Administrative Reviews 
 
 
Each dean or 
community college
 
executive
 
officer is responsible for preparin
g, scheduling, delivering 
and retaining appropriate administrative reviews of associate deans, department heads, directors and 
their equivalent.  In addition to annual performance evaluations, administrative reviews are scheduled 
to occur every few years t
o determine an incumbent

s performance as an administrator.  
Administrative reviews are often coordinated by a third party (such as NMSU

s Institutional Research) 
and may include written evaluation by both internal and external constituents.

Graduate Faculty
 
 
 
 
The ultimate responsibility for the quality of the graduate program resides in the graduate faculty, 
individual departments offering graduate work, and the cognizant dean.  The dean of 
the 
G
raduate 
School is responsible for the administration of the Graduate School's policies.  Staff members qualified 
to perform the functions of the graduate faculty are nominated by the heads of their departments for 
approval by the cognizant dean and th
e dean of the Graduate School.  The Graduate Council shall 
maintain a standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments comprised of three senior graduate 
faculty currently serving on the Graduate Council.  The standing committee on Graduate Faculty 
Appo
intments shall review and make recommendations to the dean of the Graduate School on 
appointment of faculty nominees to the graduate faculty.  This standing committee on Graduate 
Faculty Appointments also shall review appointment criteria as needed.  Appro
val will be granted in 
recognition of the staff member's active interest in graduate work as demonstrated by continual study, 
creative activity, and successful teaching.  Appointment to the graduate faculty will normally require 
that the individual have an
 
earned doctoral degree.  The qualifications of each new member of the 
graduate faculty will be given comprehensive review by the department head, cognizant dean, and the 
dean of the Graduate School at the end of 3 years.  The qualifications of each gradua
te faculty member 
will be reviewed every 3
-
5 years by the department head, cognizant dean, the Graduate Council 
standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments, and the dean of the Graduate School.  
Selection of instructors to teach courses at the 450
-
499 level is left to the department head and college 
dean; however, such persons must have at least a master's degree.  Any exceptions to this policy must 
have prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School.  Graduate students may not assign 
gra
des to other graduate students in courses numbered above 450.  Selection of individuals to teach 
courses numbered 500 and above is left to the department head and the college dean.  The individual 
must have an earned doctorate, or a master's degree with ex
tensive experience, and have evidence of 
creative activity.  Any exceptions to this policy must have the prior written approval of the dean of the 
Graduate School.  Members of the graduate faculty chair all graduate committees, direct master's 
theses, dire
ct doctoral dissertations, teach 600
-
level courses, serve as representatives of the dean of the 
Graduate School, serve on educational specialists' exams, and serve on doctoral exams.  Any exception 
to the above policy must be approved in writing by the dea
n of the Graduate School.  Before an 
individual is appointed to the graduate faculty, evidence of creative activity, in addition to the doctoral 
dissertation, is required.  In implementing this approach, the department heads, the deans and the dean 
of the 
Graduate School will review all members of the graduate faculty in their colleges and invoke the 
review clause on individuals not meeting the minimum requirements.

given, the 
university 
does not have any legal obligation to provide funding for any nontenure

College Faculty appointments are renewable annually for an unlimited time.
 
Although employing 
units are not obliga
ted to renew or to give a reason for nonrenewal of a college faculty contract, 
hiring departments are encouraged to promote an environment of stability by renewing contracts 
of college faculty when warranted by the need of the department and the performanc

academic dean to the 
executive vice president and provost
 
for each research faculty appointment.  
Salaries are normally contingent on external funding,
 
though a department or college may fund the 
salary of a research faculty member from internal funds for a short time while external funds are 
being sought. Research faculty members are evaluated annually and are eligible for salary 
increases and promotion
 
to the next rank according to policies, procedures, and criteria set by the

university 
may be associated with and provide support or ser
vice
s to one or 
more 
university

hourly pay provided). A clear statement of justification
 
as to why it is in the 

 
best 
interest to grant affiliated faculty status will be noted on the hiring forms by the department head 
and forwarded through the academic dean to the 
executive vice president and provost
 
for each 
affiliated faculty a
ppointment. The term (not to exceed 12 months), rank, and other conditions and 
expectations of these honorary appointments will be determined for each individual appointee. 
The criteria upon which the determinations are based vary depending upon the backgr
ound of the 
appointee, the nature of the discipline represented, and the needs of the 
university.
 
In general, 
persons appointed should have qualifications commensurate with the corresponding rank of 
tenure
-
track faculty appointees. The E
-
Hire Form/Personne
l Action Form must show an 
appointment end date no later than 12 months from date of hire. Affiliated faculty appointments 
may be renewed annually. Affiliated faculty may be listed in the

than the master's degree
 
may also be designated as extension associate. That individual may also 
be given the courtesy title of college instructor, college assistant professor, college associate 
professor, or college professor. An extension associate cannot obtain tenure. When an
 
extension 
associate either receives a master's degree and/or recurring state funds become available, an 
extension associate may be considered for appointment to tenure
-

G.
 
Employment Base and Status
:
  
The fixed
-
period base for employment of a nontenure
-
track faculty 
member is a time period that may be a semester, an academic year, or a fiscal year, and the amount 
of assigned effort may be figured on the basis of hours per w
eek, credits per semester, or credits 
per academic year.  The full
-
time hourly basis is 40 hours per week.  The full
-
time credit basis is 
12 credits per semester or 24 credits per academic year, except in the community colleges, where 
the full
-
time credit 
basis is 15 credits per semester or 30 credits per academic year.  The full
-
time 
equivalent (FTE) fraction for a nontenure
-
track faculty member employed on an hourly basis is the 
ratio of the number of hours assigned per week to the basis of 40 hours/week.
  
The FTE fraction 
for a nontenure
-
track faculty member employed on a credit hour basis is the ratio of the number of 
credits allocated during the applicable base period to the full
-
time credit basis applicable for that 
base period.  An FTE fraction of .9 
or greater is considered full
-
time, while an FTE fraction less 
than .9 is considered part
-
time.  A nontenure
-
track faculty member employed as temporary and 
averaging an FTE of .
67
 
per college or more over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to 
be 
considered for a regular nontenure
-
track appointment after appropriate advertising.  If not 
converted to regular appointment, the employee's FTE must average less than 
.67
 
per college 
during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years
.
 
 
A temporary fa
culty member averaging 
less than .
67
 
FTE per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for renewals of 
temporary appointments after appropriate reviews and approvals. 
Temporary appointments require 
an appointment end date on the hiring form
 
no later than 1 calendar year after the hiring date.
  
All 
temporary appointments are limited to 1 year at a time.  If there is no break in ser
vice
, both regular 
and temporary nontenure
-
track appointments may be renewed without advertising, after 
appropria
te reviews and approvals.
 
 
H.
 
Special Application for Nontenure
-
Track Temporary Community College Faculty
:
  
A nontenure
-
track faculty member employed as temporary and averaging an FTE of .625 per college or more, 
over 2 consecutive academic years 
may be el
igible to be
 
considered for a regular nontenure
-
track 
appointment after appropriate advertising. (For benefits,

) If not converted to 

per college during each of 
the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years.  A temporary faculty member averaging less than .

I.
 
Qualifications
:
  
Qualifications for appointment of nontenure
-
track faculty are to be determined in 
such a manner as to be flexible enough to meet the particular needs of each unit utilizing such 
faculty, but minimum qualifications shall be a ma
ster's degree or equivalent experience in the field 
or related field for the junior ranks of instructor and assistant professor, and an earned doctorate or 
equivalent experience in the field or related field for the senior ranks of associate professor and 
professor.
 
 
J.
 
Appointment and Nonrenewal
:
  
Each regular or temporary non
-
tenure track faculty member will 
be given a copy of the employing Personnel Action Form.  At the time of first hire at the 
university,
 
each regular or temporary nontenure
-
track facul
ty member should read this section, as 
well as the nontenure
-
track promotion procedures of the appropriate college.  Nonrenewal of a 
nontenure
-
track appointment may be without implication of criticism or specification of cause.  If 
an appointment end date 
appears on the initial Personnel Action Form, which constitutes written 
notice of the end date of the appointment.  In such a case, the individual concerned should be 
informed as soon as possible whether 
the individual
 
will be offered employment for the se
mester 
or year following the appointment end date, either as a renewal of a regular appointment or in 
temporary status.  Successive year renewals of regular appointments that specified an appointment 
end date may be made without advertising the position.  
If such a regular appointment is not 
renewed for at least the succeeding semester, then it must be re
-
advertised, unless the incumbent 
converts to temporary status and back to regular status without a break in ser
vice
.  The minimum 
written notice of nonren
ewal of a regular appointment that does not include an appointment end 
date on the Personnel Action Form will be as follows:  During the first year of ser
vice
 
in regular 
status (9
-
 
or 12
-
month basis), 3 months' notice will be given before the end of the ac
ademic year

Adjustments
:
  
Each regular and temporary nontenure
-
track faculty 
member will be evaluated annuall

mentioned 
written evaluations and the availability of funds.  Meritorious performance may be rewarded by 
encouraging nontenure
-
track faculty to apply for a tenure
-
track faculty position.  College faculty 
in regular status shall participate in the merit s
ystem.
  
Each college will develop separate policies, 
procedures, and criteria for the promotion of nontenure

Monitoring
:  During each fall and spring semester the 
executive vice president and provost
 
shall 
provide the following data to the chair of the Faculty Senate:  The number of individuals 
employed by the 
university
 
holding academic rank by headcount and FTE, by contract type 
(tenured, tenure
-
track, nontenure
-
track), by job title and rank for each academic rank unit on the 
main campus, for each of the 
community colleges
, and for all other organization units.  Where 
t
hese numbers include individuals whose primary employing unit is different from the academic 
rank unit, these data will be footnoted appropriately.  The chair of the Faculty Senate will present 
these data to the Committee on Committees for analysis and mon
itoring with respect to the above 
guidelines.

:  
Exempt
 
employees who wish to teach a

Exempt
 
employees who wish to teach 
a course for remuneration during regular working hours must obtain approval to do so from 
appropriate supervisors and the

Qualifications
 
 
A.
 
General Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus)
:  Common el
ements to be considered in 
appointment, differing only in degree in all ranks, are as follows:
 
 
1.
 
Teaching
:  This element is difficult to define precisely, but is commonly considered to include 
the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of developmen
t in the field; skill in arousing 
interest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to 
understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to 
human problems; skills in integr
ating domestic and international knowledge and insights into 
class content; and skill in raising students' awareness about the domestic and international 
social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their courses of study.
 
 
2.
 
Research:
  
This e
lement is composed, in part, of the person's research or other creative work 
that indicates professional merit and interest.  The results of this activity will find expression 
normally through accepted channels or media in the respective professional field
s or in the 
person's teaching.  Teaching and research are ordinarily closely related; it is difficult to 
comprehend how a person can teach well without having firsthand understanding of how the 
knowledge of the field is discovered.  The research performanc
e of faculty will be based on 
domestic and/or international scholarly activity.  Annual performance evaluation of any 
faculty member will recognize that success in research may require long
-
term efforts.  
Promotion and tenure and annual performance raises 
will give equivalent consideration to 
research effort and success, whether domestic or international. 
 
 
3.
 
Ser
vice
:
  
This element includes the person's general contributions to the organization and 
development of the 
university,
 
and ser
vice
s to any local, 
state, national, or international 
agency or institution needing the specific benefits to be derived from the person's professional 
knowledge and skills.
 
 
B.
 
Specific Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus)
:  In the following statements of required 
tim
e in each rank, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PERIODS STATED ARE TO 
BE CONSIDERED AS MINIMUM AND NOT AS MAXIM
UM, UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be 
taken into consideration.  It i
s also recognized that the evidence of competence differs for various 
fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform.

a.
 
Instructor:  This rank should be given to persons with advanced training who have 
demonstrated scholarly/creative ability.  Usually, the individual will not yet have 
demonstrated ability to do both teaching and research independently.  An inst
ructor must 
have knowledge of the particular course materials and should have some intellectual 
vision; but need not be expected to have acquired a significant understanding and original 
point of view or philosophy of the general subject.  In addition to s
uch general 
considerations, as stated above, the specific degree requirements for this rank will 
normally be the master's degree or the equivalent, and except under unusual 
circumstances the instructor will be encouraged to be studying toward a terminal de
gree.
 
b.
 
Assistant Professor:  To
 
be considered for this rank, a person must have demonstrated 
ability in the field.  It is strongly believed that a relationship exists between teaching and

research, and that a good teacher or researcher must constantly remol
d the materials of 
the courses or projects in the light of new knowledge derived from the person's own 
creative scholarship as well as that of others.  An assistant professor may be expected to 
have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment 
of the general field of 
the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole.  In addition to such general 
considerations as stated above, specific degree requirements for advancement or 
promotion to the rank of assistant professor and, of course, a
pplicable to the senior ranks 
as well, NORMALLY will be the doctor's degree.  Outstanding experience and 
recognition in the profession outside the academic field may be considered as the 
equivalent of the degree requirement.
 
 
2.
 
SENIOR RANKS
.  
Appointment or 
promotion to either senior rank should represent an 
implicit prediction on the part of the department, college, and the 
university
 
that the 
individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the 
remainder of the individua

investigation of the candidate's promise in scholarship, teaching, research, leadership, and 
learning. By this statement it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the 
ca
ndidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the 
extent to which past performance in teaching and creative work may be expected to carry on 
through continuing and enlarged contributions. Ser
vice
s rendered to commu
nities and 
agencies or organizations in the person's professional capacity shall be considered in assessing 
qualifications for advancement to senior ranks.
 
 
a.
 
Associate Professor:  This person's views contribute to departmental policy.  An associate 
professo
r should have competence and mature outlook over a fairly large part of the 
whole field.  To be considered for this rank a person should expect to serve for at least 4 
years as an assistant professor under normal circumstances.  A candidate for an associat
e 
professorship is expected to have demonstrated capacities in the lower ranks and should 
offer evidence that teaching and research have kept abreast of times in method and 
subject matter; that a greater degree of maturity has been attained and that there 
has been 
a retention of interest in competent teaching and research.  Furthermore, the candidate 
must have shown evidence of productivity and competent scholarship beyond that 
completed for the degree of the doctorate.
 
b.
 
Professor:  Appointment
 
of individual
s to professorships is obviously the most critical 
step in determining the future of the academic caliber of the 
university.
  
There should, 
therefore, be clear understanding of the functions and qualifications of individuals in this 
rank.  A professor thro
ugh teaching, creative activity, and ser
vice
 
should have 
demonstrated substantial command of the whole field, sound scholarship, and a mature 
view of the discipline.  Appointment or promotion to professor should not be considered 
to be forthcoming merely b
ecause of years of ser
vice
 
to the 
university
 
(it should not be 
expected based on any number of years as an associate professor) or because a 
continuous contract is achieved.  Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is 
expected to have maintai
ned all of the qualities and conditions required for tenure and the 
associate professor rank.  In addition, a professor should exhibit special stature in the 
discipline, leadership and substantial strength in all areas
-
teaching, creative activity, and 
prof
essional ser
vice
.  In the recommending procedures the department head and the 
faculty member shall submit information as follows:
 
 
i.
 
Special Stature in the Discipline
:
 

 
Teaching Performance:  Data indicating performance, including innovation, 
enthusiasm, and 
contributions to activities designed for the improvement of 
instruction. Peer and student evaluation may be useful ingredients in 
determining teaching performance.

Teaching:  This element is commonly considered to include the teacher's knowledge of the 
field; awareness of and the application of de
velopments in the field; skill in arousing interest 
and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to 
understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to 
human problems; and ski
ll in awakening students to a realization of the social, political, 
economic, and ethical implications of their study. 
 
 
2.
 
Professional Ser
vice
:  This element includes, above all, the faculty member's ser
vice
 
with 
respect to the organization, development, an
d welfare of the community college and the 
university.
  
This element also includes ser
vice
 
to any individual or group needing the specific 
benefits of the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills.
 
 
3.
 
Other Ser
vice
:  This element allows a faculty me
mber to be recognized for ser
vice
 
to the 
general welfare of the community which is interrelated with the welfare of the community 
college.
 
 
4.
 
Research:  Research or other creative work is not required at the community colleges.  
However, those faculty member
s who produce research and/or creative work should be 
encouraged, and such work should be considered for appointment, promotion, and tenure 
considerations.  
 
 
The academic credentials of all community college instructors will be reviewed by the community 
c
ollege program coordinators (when appropriate), division heads, and the chief instructional 
officer to meet the guidelines established by the main campus departments.  Instructors must also 
be approved by the campus

the time served in a rank at another institution should be taken into consideration.  It is also 
recognized that the evidence for various fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot

a.
 
Associate Professor:  An associate professor occupies a position adjunct to that of the 
professor.  This person's views contribute to community college policy.  An associate 
professo

teaching has kept abreast of times in method and subject matter, that a greater degree of 
maturity has been attained, and that there has been a retention of interest in competent

at least 4 years as an assistant professor under normal circumstances.
 
b.
 
Professor:  Appointment
 
or promotion of individuals to professorships is obviously the

General
 
 
 
It is the policy of the 
university
 
to provide conditions under which high quality instruction, 
research 
and ser
vice
 
may be expected to occur.  The faculty and administration recognize that quality education 
is based on and will occur as the result of interaction and contact between professionally competent 
faculty and adequately prepared students.  
Statements in this manual which are concerned with 
assignment of faculty load and with the award of academic credit are expressed 
generally in terms of 
the amount of contact occurring between faculty and students
.  
In practice, many academic efforts, 
havin
g little
 
or nothing to do with 
the amount of contact 
per se
, are nevertheless
 
quantified and 
rewarded
 
in terms of the credit hours.  Such cases are covered by prior approvals among students, 
faculty and administrators.  This policy is 
based on the followin

Internalization Generally
: 
Internationalization is the incorporation of international content, 
materials, activities, and understanding into teachi
ng, research, and public ser
vice
 
functions of 
universities to enhance their relevance in an interdependent world.  The major elements of the 
strategy being used to internationalize our 
university
 
are:
 
 
1.
 
Defining international goals/objectives.
 
 
2.
 
Determining 
specific actions/activities relating to goals/objectives.

Internationalization Policy
:  
The current 
emphasis is seeking a balance between the concepts of 
cooperation and competition.  This new emphasis places a major responsibility on the U.S. 
universities for providing relevant educational experiences for their students so that they are 
equipped to comp
ete, become gainfully employed, and participate effectively as citizens in the 
new and emerging world environment.  The principal purpose of

international projects will be given consideration in evaluating annual performance, merit 
increases, promotion, and advancement to continuous contract.  In future evaluati

consideration may be given to how knowledge and insight gained during an international 
assignment are integrated into the faculty member's teaching, research, and outreach 
responsibilities after returning from this assignment.  (

A.
 
Purpose
:  
Faculty members perform a wide variety of tasks determined by the requirements of 
their discipline and by the mission of the
 
university.
 
Accordingly their workload will vary from 
individual to individual and over time for a particular individual. The purpose of the Faculty 
Workload Policy is to establish a fair and equitable allocation of workload among faculty taking 
into acco
unt the interests of the faculty and the needs of the 
university.
 
Recognizing the complex 
role played by faculty in the 
university
 
setting, the primary responsibility for establishing 
workloads shall rest with the departments or equivalent administrative u
nit
. 
 
 
B.
 
Scope of Application
:  
The rules set out here apply to faculty time financed from instruction and 
general (I
 
&
 
G) funds. Faculty time not financed by I
 
&
 
G funds is not covered by these rules. 
Faculty time partially funded from I
 
&
 
G shall be prorat
ed
.
 
 
C.
 
Teaching Load, Generally, for NMSU LC Faculty
:  
A faculty member employed on the Las 
Cruces (Main) Campus budgeted exclusively from I&G funds will normally be responsible for the 
equivalent of teaching 12 credits per semester.  The faculty member may 
be expected to 
participate in some scholarly and creative activity, professional and/or public ser
vice
, or internal 
ser
vice
 
to the 
university.
 

for formal instruction. 
 
 
D.
 
Teaching Load
, Generally, for Community College Faculty
:  
The teaching load for community 
college faculty members will usually be the equivalent of 15 credits a semester or from 27 to 30 
credits an academic year 
The teaching load shall be prorated for short courses or 
courses taught 
over part of a semesters.
 
 
 
E.
 
Equitable Distribution of Workload
:  
 
 
1.
 
Executive Administration:  
The 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
and 
president
 
shall seek 
to allocate faculty resources among departments or equivalent administrative unit
s, taking 
account of internal and external constraints, so as to distribute workload in a fair and equitable 
manner. Factors that may be considered in allocating resources include accreditation, 
workloads at peer institutions, national disciplinary norms, 
and retention
 
of faculty, the needs 
of new programs, credit hour production, legislative mandates, and other factors. 
 
 
2.
 
Dean or Equivalent: 
Within each college or equivalent unit, the college dean or equivalent 
administrator shall seek to allocate faculty 
resources within their college or equivalent unit in 
order to achieve a fair and equitable workload. When inequitable workloads arise, it shall be 
the responsibility of the dean or equivalent administrator to rectify the inequality. 
 
 
F.
 
Departmental Workload
 
Policy
:  
 
 
1.
 
Departments and equivalent units will specify how they determine teaching loads.  
Departmental or equivalent unit workload policy will be 1) developed by the department 
faculty in collaboration with the department head and approved by the dean 
or equivalent 
administrator, 2) contained in written departmental guidelines, and 3) distributed to all faculty 
in the department. Department guidelines shall clearly specify the method by which teaching 
load is distributed. The dean or equivalent may ask 
for revisions to the departmental workload 
policy.
 
 
2.
 
In determining teaching load, the departmental or equivalent unit workload policy shall 
consider the impact of: courses with a lab component; career path of the instructor; tenure and 
promotion; workloads
 
at peer institutions; national disciplinary norms; faculty retention; 

or doctoral dissertations; student advising and retention activity; mentoring activity,

productivity; new 
preparations; method of course delivery; class size; help from graduate assistants; 
administrative and/or ser
vice
 
assignments; team teaching; and methods of grading. Gi
ven the 
importance of graduate programs to the mission of the 
university,
 
special consideration must 
be given to support of graduate programs. Other factors specific to particular departments or 
disciplines may also be considered.
 
 
G.
 
Annual 
Determination of 
Individual Faculty Teaching Load
/Right to Appeal
:  
The teaching load 
for each faculty member will be determined annually by the department head or equivalent 
administrator through a process that follows established departmental or equivalent unit policy an
d 
involves an element of negotiation. The agreed upon teaching load for each faculty member will 
be articulated in writing and signed by the faculty member and the department head or equivalent 

ersonnel folder. If agreement on 
these responsibilities cannot be reached, the faculty member may appeal the case in accordance 
with 
university
 
procedures. (
See
 
Policy 4.05.50, Faculty Grievance Review and Re
solution
) In an 
appeal situation, if a change in academic responsibilities will affect the faculty member for more 
than one semester, the appeals procedure must have been completed before the reassignment can 
be made or continued.
 
 
H.
 
Considerations for Vari
ance
:  
The percentage breakdown of time allocated to each academic 
activity may vary among faculty members.  
 
 
1.
 
The allocation will be based on the average time required for the satisfactory performance of 
the activity.
 
 
2.
 
Courses such as thesis, dissertation
, research, special problems and independent study are not 
automatically considered to be the equivalent with teaching typical graduate or undergraduate 
courses.  When such activities are included in the teaching load, the department head or 
equivalent adm
inistrator and the affected faculty member shall collaboratively determine 
course equivalency consistent with the department teaching load policy. 
 
 
3.
 
In collaboration with faculty in their department or equivalent unit, and subject to approval by 
the colleg
e dean or equivalent administrator, department head or equivalent administrator may 
make adjustments to faculty teaching loads if those adjustments increase load equity and are 
at least revenue neutral.  Adjustments to teaching loads within programs should
 
result in or 
maintain load equity, should respect the career paths of faculty, and should not place an extra 
teaching burden on junior faculty who are preparing for tenure review. When a faculty 
member is assigned special duties above the normal load, arr
angements will be negotiated 
between the faculty member and concerned administrators to determine the amount of 
additional compensation, if any, to be received.
 
 
4.
 
When considering individuals for tenure, promotion in rank, merit pay increases, 
research/ser
v
ice
 
awards, and/or endowed chairs/professorships, departmental workload policy 


activities, and ser
vice
 
must be considered in the review process. 
 
 
I.
 
Cooperation
:  
The successful application of these guidelines depends upon maintaining goodwill 
between faculty and administrators.

c
ollege and two
-
year campus guidelines may reflect 
varied factors that include, but are not limited to, market demand for distance education courses, 
current compensation of individual faculty and the distance 
education modalities used in the 
courses.
  
Faculty may be compensated for teaching distance education in one of two ways, 
Differential Compensation and/or Supplemental Compensation.
  
 
 
1.
 
Differential Compensation
:  
 
 
a.
 
Differential compensation involves compen
sation for preparation of new distance 
education courses/programs and is determined by each college.  
 
b.
 
This compensation may also be made available to faculty to maintain existing courses or 
programs.
 
c.
 
Faculty members may also receive differential compensat
ion for teaching a distance 
education course.  Differential compensation for teaching distance education courses may 
be provided as reassigned teaching time, release from other responsibilities, additional 
salary, 
g
raduate 
a
ssistance support, full or part
-
time support personnel, stipends for 
contractors/vendors, etc.  
 
d.
 
The form of compensation is at the discretion of the college administrator after 
consultation with the faculty member.  
 
e.
 
Differential compensation may also be provided for faculty members who
 
travel to an 
off
-
campus site to teach distance education courses in addition to approved 
university
 
travel compensation.
 
f.
 
U
niversity
 
travel compensation as an addition to differential compensation is to be based 
on the distance traveled to teach the course
 
and the number of trips made in any given 
semester for the expressed purpose of teaching the course or advising students in a course 
or program.
 
 
2.
 
Supplemental Compensation
:  
Faculty members who teach a distance education course as an 
overload may receive 
supplemental compensation as presented in 
S
ection 
4.70
 
or negotiated 
with the appropriate college dean.
 
 
a.
 
Any contract course is expected to be self
-
supporting including fringe benefits.  Faculty 
compensation f
or contract courses must follow appropriate 
university
 
policy.
 
b.
 
Instructors who travel to remote sites shall be compensated for their travel at the mileage 
and per diem rates determined through 
university
 
travel policy.
 
 
C.
 
Small Class Sections
:  
Distance educ
ation courses with an enrollment of fewer than ten 
undergraduate or five graduate students will be subject to small course monitoring.

:  
 
 
1.
 
The faculty member shall submit a written notification of consulting to the facu
lty member's 
immediate supervisor (usually the department head) prior to initiation of consulting.  At times, 
consulting opportunities arise when it is not possible to immediately submit a written 
notification (such as weekends or holidays).  In those case
s, the faculty member is expected to 
make every possible effort to submit the notification on the next regular business day for the 
university.

member's immediate supervisor and appropriate dean or director.  The request for consulting 
time must be acted up
on within 5 working days.
 
 
4.
 
Prior written approval and financial arrangements for reimbursement must be obtained from 
the immediate supervisor before 
university
 
facilities, equipment, personnel or supplies may be 
used in consulting by the faculty member.  T
hese arrangements will be reviewed by the 
appropriate dean or director and may be disapproved, with cause.
 
 
5.
 
Causes for denial of consulting privileges include, but are not limited to:  a clear conflict
-
of
-
interest situation, unprofessional conduct by the f
aculty member negatively reflecting on the

Faculty Rank
:  Depar
tment heads are academic administrators, with faculty rank, but eligible for 
consideration under all policies applying to the faculty.  For example, some department heads have 
been promoted to a higher rank and some have been tenured, but obviously the pro
motion and 
tenure considerations were in keeping with their positio
ns as members of the faculty.
 
 
C.
 
Length of Appointment
:  For department heads who are 12

month employees, the year is from

July 1 to June 30.  Department heads 
that
 
have negotiated a 9
-
mon
th appointment come under the 
policies of the regular faculty with respect to all pay and fringe benefits and normally are excluded 
from summer teaching.  Department heads observe the administrative calendar. 
 
 
D.
 
Salary Determination
:  When an internal ca
ndidate is selected, department head salary normally is 
determined by multiplying the 9
-
month faculty salary by 12/9 and adding the department head 
increment.

Department Heads 
-
 
Leaves
 
 
A.
 
Annual Leave
:  Department heads are treated the same as all other 12
-
month employees, except 
for those provisions pertaining to teaching responsibilities.  For example, regular full
-
time 
employees, including department 
heads, are granted 22 working days annual leave a year 
beginning with the date of employment.  Unused annual leave may be accumulated but shall not 
exceed more than 30 working days.  However, all department heads are urged to take annual leave 
each year be
cause it is felt that administrators need this time off to ensure their continued 
effectiveness. A change in assignment of a 12
-
month person to less than annual regular 
employment within the 
university
 
will result in payment of any unused leave up to 30 da
ys.  Also, 
a department head 
that
 
terminates or retires from the 
university
 
will be paid for unused leave up to 
30 working days. Accurate annual leave records for department heads must be maintained in the 
deans' offices. 
 
 
B.
 
Sick Leave
:  Under the 12
-
mon
th plan for department heads, the sick leave policy is observed.  
Regular full
-
time employees are granted 12 working days of sick leave a year which may be 
accumulated up to 800 hours per year.   A department head returning to a 9
-
month faculty contract 
is
 
not eligible for unused sick leave, but comes under the sick leave policies for the faculty.  
Accurate sick leave records must be maintained in the deans' offices.  
 
 
C.
 
Annual/Sick Leave for Acting Department Heads
:  Nine
-
month faculty who serve temporar
ily in 
exempt 
positions such as acting department head should be changed by Personnel Action Form 
from faculty to 
exempt staff
 
for the period.  Consequently, they will earn sick leave and annual 
leave at the regular 12
-
month rate, or at 9/12, 10/12, or 11/
12 adjusted rates as applicable during 
the time of administrative ser
vice
.  If the faculty member returns to 9
-
month faculty status 
afterward, another Personnel Action Form should change 
the
 
status again from 
exempt staff
 
to 
faculty.
 
 
D.
 
Sabbatical Leave
: 
 
Sabbatical leave for department heads is determined by a formula prorating the 
time they have been on 9
-
 
and 12
-
month contracts during the previous 6 years counted towards the 
sabbatical leave.
 
 
E.
 
Summer Sabbatical Leave
:  A department head gains eligibi
lity for sabbatical leave as indicated in 
the sabbatical leave section(s) of this manual, and may elect to take such leave in segments.  Each 
leave segment should be of sufficient length to permit a significant planned accomplishment.  
When segments are us
ed, the accrual for the next sabbatical leave begins with the end of the year 
in which the first segment was taken.  The entire sabbatical leave will be charged to the 
departmental salary budget.

Leadership of the faculty impli
es working closely with the faculty on the 
development and sustenance of departmental courses and
 
the stimulation and encouragement of
 
faculty
 
development.  A performance evaluation of each faculty member will be carried out at 
least once a year and should
 
be made in the positive vein of professional development.  Evaluation 
of
 
the progress of

J.
 
Supervision of Graduate Assistants
:  Graduate assistants are recommended for appointment by the 
department head
.  The appointment requires approval of the college and graduate dean.  Three 
letters of recommendation are required for the approval.  Specific orientation and training of 
graduate assistants are the responsibilities of the department head.  Graduate assi
stants work under 
the close supervision of faculty.  The policy on academic freedom does not apply to the ser
vice
 
expected of graduate assistants.  The assignment of teaching duties to graduate assistants is the 
responsibility of the department head.  Such
 
assignment requires that the department head 
ascertain that the graduate assistant is fully qualified and that the work performed by the graduate 
assistant be closely supervised by a member of the faculty responsible for monitoring the assigned 
tasks asso
ciated with the graduate assistant

s teaching responsibility.  Only those graduate 
assistants proficient in English may be assigned to teaching or teaching
-
related activities.

Purpose
:
  
To establish policy and procedures by which allegations of serious faculty misconduct, 
or inability to perform essential functions of the
 
job, may be addressed
 
equitably, expeditiously 
and without violating the principles of academic freedom or due process. 
 
 
B.
 
Scope:
  
This policy applies when serious misconduct, or inability to perform essential functions of 
the job, is reasonably suspected 
of any tenured, tenure track, or regular, non

makes the fact to be proven highly probable or reasonably certain.  
 
To prove a fact by clear 
and convincing evidence is evidence stronger than a "
preponderance" and yet less than 
"beyond a reasonable doubt;" for evidence to be clear and convincing, it must instantly tilt the 
scales in the affirmative when weighed against the evidence in opposition and the fact finder's 
mind is left with an abiding c
onviction that the evidence is true.

p
resident for 
h
uman 
r
esources, in consultation with the Office of

refers to the individual who performs or coordinates the confidential investigation
 
into 
the 
allegations against 
the faculty member, including issuance of the investigat

and/or Office of General Counsel regarding the appropriate level of 
corrective action warranted, if any; prepares the notice o
f proposed corrective action; and 
presents the matter to the pre

K below.)
 
The investigative administrator will usually be
 
the immediate supervisor, or academic 
department head.  It may also mean someon
e designated to serve in lieu of the immediate 
supervisor, in the event of a conflict of interest. (i.e. if the investigative administrator is 
implicated in the alleged misconduct.) In cases involving alleged discrimination in violation 
of federal or state

Institutional Equity.  In cases involving alleged embezzlement or other white collar type 
criminal activity, the investigation may be conducted by law enforcement, the Office of 
Intern
al Audit or other expert in the field.  In these instances, the investigative administrator 
will coordinate with the involved supervisor, and HRS in order to determine the facts and the 
appropriate corrective or disciplinary action.

Alternative Dispute Resolution
:
  
At any stage in the processes described herein, if mutually agreed 
to between the parties, the 
disputed matter may be stayed as the parties attempt to resolve the 
dispute through an alternate method of dispute resolution, including but not limited to the 
following methods:  mediation, settlement facilitation, or other negotiated resolution outside o
f the 
formal hearing processes provided for herein.    
 
 
 
G.
 
Administrative Leave
:
  
When a faculty member is reasonably suspected or otherwise accused of 
serious misconduct constituting just cause under this policy, the faculty member may be placed on 
paid ad
ministrative leave pending a confidential investigation, in accordance with the following 
protocol:  
 
 
1.
 
These decisions will be made on a case by case basis by the department head or equivalent 
supervisor, in conjunction with the Office of H
uman 
R
esource 
S
e
rvices
, and based upon the 
facts alleged in each matter, including the potential risk of harm to students, others or the 
institution.   
 
 
2.
 
Approval from the 
a
ssistant 
v
ice 
p
resident of 
h
uman 
r
esource 
s
ervices or designee is required 
to place any faculty mem
ber on paid administrative leave or to relocate, or to reassign job 
duties, pending the investigation.  The dean will be notified about the pendency of the internal 
investigation, but not about the factual details.  
 
 
3.
 
In lieu of paid administrative leave, 
a faculty member may be temporarily relocated to an 
alternate work environment or be assigned to perform alternate job duties, provided such 
temporary job modification will not in any way impede the investigation.  
 
 
4.
 
A faculty member placed on paid adminis
trative leave shall remain available for 
communications from NMSU, and otherwise be ready to report to work upon request.  If the 
faculty member has a need to be absent during a period of administrative leave, the faculty 
member shall obtain the appropriat
e approval.  
 
 
H.
 
Confidential Investigation
:
  
The allegations, and any defense raised by the faculty member in 
response to the allegations, shall be investigated fully and fairly, within a reasonable amount of 
time, and as confidentially as possible; based u
pon the circumstances involved in each matter.
 
 
1.
 
The investigative administrator shall consult with the assistant vice president of human 
resources or designee and/or the university general counsel for guidance and support relating 
to the performance of the
 
internal investigation.  
 
 
2.
 
The faculty member accused shall be provided notice of the charges at the appropriate time 
during the investigation, which may be when the investigation begins, or may be later, 
depending upon the nature of the allegations.  The
 
faculty member shall be given an 
opportunity to respond to the charges during the investigation process.  
 
 
3.
 
The investigation shall be documented with factual findings and supporting evidence.  The 
evidence may consist of witness statements or summaries, 
documents, audio or video 
recordings or photographs, or other exhibits.  The investigative report, including supporting 
documentation or other evidence, shall be delivered to the 
a
ssistant 
v
ice 
p
resident of 
h
uman 
r
esource 
s
ervices. The investigative admini
strator shall retain the investigative work papers, 
investigative report and supporting documentation or other evidence in a confidential and 
secure location.  
 
 
4.
 
The investigative administrator shall confer with the assistant vice president for human 
resou
rce services and/or the office of university general counsel to decide whether or not the 
findings warrant corrective administrative action.   
 
 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

5.
 
As soon as practicable, the charged faculty member shall be informed generally regarding the 
results of the inv
estigation. 
 
 
6.
 
If the faculty member is exonerated by the investigation, then no documentation referencing 
the investigation shall remain in the official personnel file, unless requested by the faculty 
member.   
 
 
7.
 
If corrective action is going to be pursued
, the faculty member will be provided a copy of the 
investigative report and access to the supporting documents at the time that the corrective 
action is formally proposed.
 
 
 
8.
 
In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good f
aith, report 
reasonably suspected misconduct, the university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken 
against the reporter or any person who cooperates in the investigative process.  A complaint 
of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the init
iation of a separate internal investigation 
to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if 
substantiated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment.  
 
 
9.
 
If the investigative re
port reflects that the alleged misconduct was not substantiated, the 
university will make efforts to restore the reputation of the faculty member, to the extent 
feasible and desired by the faculty member. Additionally, and depending upon the 
circumstances,
 
the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the 
investigative report indicates that the initial report of suspected misconduct or any testimony 
given as part of the internal investigation may have been intentionally falsifie
d.  If deliberate 
falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for 
disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment.

Just Cause Required
:
 
Just 
C
ause
, capable of being pr
oven by the standard of proof set forth at 
subsection K.3,
 
is required before suspension without pay, reduction in salary, or involuntary 
dismissal may be imposed.  Just cause includes dishonest behavior, gross or habitual neglect of 
professional responsib
ilities,
 
willful violation of NMSU policy, use of any improper influence to 
secure a promotion or privileges for individual advantage or any other serious misconduct causing 
or creating the potential for harm to person, property or the institution.   
 
 
Jus
t 
C
ause may also be unrelated to any misconduct on the part of faculty, and could include a loss 

duties; or the medical inability to perform essential function
s of the job.
 
 
J.
 
Administrative or Corrective Action
:
  
Corrective or other administrative action may be taken for 

the applicable standard of proof
 
through th
e investigative fact finding process.     
 
 
 
1.
 
The types of administrative action anticipated by this policy include one or more of the

The range of corrective action which may be imposed for misconduct is not intended to 
require progressive discipline; rather, it is intended to allow the severity of the corrective 
action to match the seriousness of the policy violation or mi
sconduct.  The corrective action, 
if any, to be imposed will vary depending upon the severity of the misconduct substantiated 
by the investigative findings.

General Description of Due Process
:
 
A recommendation to dismiss from employment or to reduce 

property rights, which is why just cause an
d due process are required before such action may be 
taken.  
 
 
1.
 
Due process requires fair and timely hearing processes, before an impartial hearing official or 
body.  The faculty member charged with misconduct and facing serious disciplinary action is 
entit
led to a pre
-
determination hearing, at which the relevant facts are presented by the 
parties, and determined by a hearing officer to be accurate prior to proceeding with the 
proposed corrective action.  This ensures that the faculty member has had an adequ
ate 
opportunity to present a defense to the claims and the evidence; it also ensures that the 
decision makers have an accurate understanding of the facts underlying the recommendation.  
 
 
2.
 
The faculty member also has the right to a post
-
determination appeal
 
to the executive vice 
president and provost, as well as the right to request a final review by the university president.  
 
 
3.
 
At the pre
-
determination hearing and any subsequent appeal, the burden of proving just cause
 
by the applicable standard of proof
 
is
 
on NMSU.  
The standard of proof shall be clear and 
convincing evidence for all infractions, except for disciplinary action proposed for 
discrimination proscribed by federal and state law, which matters are investigated by the 

utional Equity; the burden of proof when discrimination 
constitutes the grounds for which the disciplinary action is being taken shall be preponderance 
of the evidence.  
(See subsections D.4. and D.5.)
 
 
 
L.
 
Time Deadlines and Extensions:
  
The pre
-
determinatio
n, appeal and final review processes will be 
conducted as expeditiously as possible.
 
 
1.
 
At the request from a party, a one
-
time extension of the time deadline may be granted, after 

 
to the request.  
 
 
2.
 
If the request for the time extension is from a hearing Faculty Appeals Board member, the 
chair of Faculty Senate may grant a reasonable extension, with notice to all parties. 
 
 
3.
 
A second or subsequent request for time extension from any
 
party or from a Faculty Appeals 
Board member will only be granted in exceptional cases, after consideration of the basis for 
the request and the respective positions of the parties.  The Faculty Appeals Board or Faculty 
Senate chair may deny a request for
 
extension, in the best interest of the institution, even if no 
party opposes it.

Policy Statement
:  
The performance of each faculty member will be reviewed at least once a year 
by the department head, comparable administrator, or a committee. This review will include a 
writt
en report submitted by the faculty member.  The form(s) of this report shall be determined by 
individual colleges (
community colleges
) in consultation with their departments.  The department 
head or comparable administrator shall report the results of this
 
review to the individual being 
reviewed.  These results shall serve to establish the goals for the following year.  A written copy 
of the evaluation shall be given to the faculty member. 
 
 
B.
 
Procedures for the Faculty Performance Evaluation System
: 
 
 
1.
 
 
Each 
college uses its own performance evaluation form.  Early in each fall semester the 
department head or comparable administrator supplies each faculty member with a form.  At 
this time the department head confers
 
with new faculty members concerning the recor
ding of 
objectives and goals and the general use of the form.  In the case of continuing faculty 
members, the department head or faculty may request a conference for the purpose of revising 
or updating objectives previously agreed upon.  Department heads w
ill share the above 
agreements in writing with the faculty member.
 
 
2.
 
 
Department heads are expected to meet with all new and returning faculty members regarding 
progress toward promotion and tenure and to certify in writing to the appropriate dean that 
thes
e meetings have occurred.  Specific evaluative comments in each of the three areas of 
performance are required, as well as separate comments about progress toward tenure and 
toward promotion.
 
 
3.
 
 
Each faculty member completes a written form detailing and cit
ing accomplishments in the 
broad categories of teaching, research and/or creative scholarship, and ser
vice
 
during the 
performance evaluation period.  The type, method of collection, and disposition of evidence 
regarding effectiveness of teaching is of part
icular importance, and faculty should consult 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

with department heads concerning collection of this evidence.  The performance evaluation 
form, along with any supplemental material, is submitted by each faculty member to 
the
 

department head.
 
 
4.
 
The department head reviews the faculty performance forms, prepares a written evaluation 
based upon accomplishments reported as compared with previously set goals and objectives 
(a copy of this report will be shared with the faculty member), and confers 
with appropriate 
deans to achieve consensus on the written recommendation and the prepared summary to be 
discussed with the faculty member.  Following the conference with the dean, the department 
head meets with the faculty member to discuss all aspects of
 
the performance evaluation, 
addressing separately the person

s progress toward promotion, progress toward tenure, 
strengths, and weaknesses.  This conference also serves to set goals and objectives for the 
ensuing year.  No mention shall be made at this c
onference of the recommendation in terms of 
dollars.  These goals and objectives will be placed in writing, with a copy to the faculty 
member.
 
 
5.
 
 
At 
community colleges
 
with program coordinators, the coordinator performs the duties of a 
department head in th
e evaluation process.  The coordinator will confer with the community 
college
 
executive
 
officer, who in turn confers with the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
. 
 
 
6.
 
 
Department heads formulate recommendations where appropriate regarding promotion and 
tenu
re on the basis of policies stated in this manual.  These are communicated to the college 
dean.
 
 
7.
 
 
Each college generates its own time schedule for accomplishing the above items, within the 
parameters of the 
university
 
calendar.

The Post

Tenure Review Policy ensures that all tenured faculty members will receive an annual review 
and that those with either exceptionally fine performance or serious deficiencies in one or more areas 
will be identified. Special achievemen
t shall be rewarded in a manner determined by each college or 
community college campus.  For a tenured faculty member who receives two successive unsatisfactory 
annual reviews with identified and uncorrected serious deficiencies, this policy provides a mec
hanism 
to establish a remedial program for correcting the deficiencies.  The legislation to which this policy 
responds is particularly concerned with the quality of teaching, and that fact shall be considered when 
taking any action under this policy.  In p
articular, faculty whose teaching needs improvement will be

Introduction 
 
 
A.
 
Promotion and tenure decisions are the means by which NMSU rewards and retains its most 
valued scholars, sustains excellence in its instructional discip
lines, and fulfills its mission to 
advance knowledge.  The quality of faculty accomplishments in teaching and advising (or its 
equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and ser
vice
 
largely determines 
the quality of the 
university
 
as a whole.  The granting of tenure or promotion to associate or full 
professor represents a prediction by the 
university
 
that the individual concerned will continue to 
make substantial contributions to the profession and the 
university.
 
 
B.
 
The processes inv
olved in promotion and tenure rely upon basic principles in order to be effective.  
Above all, the promotion and tenure processes must be fair, transparent, and participatory.  These 
values mean that decisions must be made without regard to race, national 
origin, gender, gender 
identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special 
friendships, or animus towards candidates, taking care to avoid conflicts of interest, structural, 
institutional, or habitual thought
s and patterns that could lead to discrimination.  NMSU values the 
richness that inquiry based upon intellectual and cultural differences brings to the 
university
 
community.
 
 
C.
 
Each principal unit must develop written standards by the end of the Spring Semes
ter of 2008 
based on criteria developed by that principal unit subject to the approval of the dean or equivalent 
administrator.  Criteria and procedures must be clear and readily available to all participants and 

 
NMSU Policy Manual                                                              
                                                                                                
Chapter 
5
  
Page

of

must be followed by all participants at eac
h level of the process.  Therefore, it is imperative that 
clear standards for annual performance evaluation, promotion, and tenure be articulated and 
broadly publicized.  Applicants for tenure or promotion must be judged on their performance of 
the duties 
assigned to them, following agreed
-
upon allocations of effort.  The process needs to 
involve broad consultation by groups and individuals with successively broader views of the 
mission of the 
university,
 
and provide the opportunity for appeal.  In order to
 
achieve fairness, 
transparency, and broad
-
based participation, all of the parties must base decisions on the 
documentation called for by this policy.
 
 
D.
 
This policy relies on the four types of scholarship defined by Ernest L. Boyer (1990) in his book 


1
, namely, the scholarships of discovery, of teaching, of integration, 
and of engagement.  Broadening the definition of scholarship 
(

ee
 
S
ection

) reflects the 
changing roles of faculty member
s in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, 
extension, outreach and ser
vice
.
 
 
E.
 
This policy takes effect at the beginning of the Fall Semester, 2008.

Guiding Principles
 
 
The following guiding principles are critical underpinnings to the promotion and tenure process at 
NMSU.
 
 
5.90.3.1
 
Faculty Participation
 
 
The selection and retention of facult
y members are of utmost importance to the quality of the 
university,
 
the achievement of 
university
 
goals, and the future of the institution.  In order to ensure a 
fair process for recognition of excellent faculty, it shall be the policy of the 
university
 
t
o allow faculty 
members to vote on the promotion or tenure of departmental colleagues, exercising collegial judgment 
based on an established set of criteria.
 
 
5.90.3.2
 
Transparency of Process
 
 
A.
 
Access to Promotion and Tenure Policies/University Posting
: 
 
For faculty members to trust the 
promotion and tenure process, they need to have a clear idea of what is expected of them, how 
they will be evaluated, and the rules of the process.  To this end, the 
university
 
website will 
include a specific link to the 
u
niversity
 
-
wide promotion and tenure policy, professional ethics 
related to promotion and tenure, the appeals process, and links to college
,
 
department, or division 
policy statements.
  
 
 
B.
 
Departmental and Principal Unit Postings
:  
 
 
1.
 
To promote the transp
arency of the process, each principal unit shall post on its website its 
written policy document aligned with the Guiding Principles, Criteria, and Policies outlined in 
this policy. 
 
 
 
 
2.
 
Websites will also contain links to the 

 
promotion and ten
ure documents, as well 
as to each of the department websites.
 
 
3.
 
In addition, each department shall post on its website its current statement of goals, 
objectives, and expectations as these relate to promotion and tenure (sometimes called a 
functions and cri
teria statement).  These shall be agreed upon by the faculty in each 
department and approved by the responsible dean or comparable administrator.

Performance Evaluation
 
 
The annual performance evaluation is a component of the promotion and tenure process.  This multi
-
layered evaluation system relies on consistency at each level of review.  The performance of 
each 
faculty member, including college faculty, will be reviewed at least once a year.  The performance 
evaluation provides documentation of expectations and a record of faculty performance relative to 
stated expectations
.  
The form of the evaluation is de
termined by the college or community college and 
shall align with promotion and tenure expectations.

Allocation of Effort

A.
 
Service to Missio
n
:  
The amount of effort that faculty members regardless of rank or position 
devote to the various aspects of their duties necessarily varies, and any fair promotion and tenure 
process will recognize these variations.  A successful process considers whethe
r the faculty 
member is effectively serving the mission of the 
university,
 


a faculty member made in response to admin
istrators or committees are taken into account during 
promotion and tenure evaluation and are not discredited.
 
 
B.
 
Fairness Despite Variance in Duties
:  
One faculty member may devote more time to teaching at 
one point than at another.  The efforts of two facu
lty members may vary at the same points in their 
careers according to their particular strengths and department needs.  Faculty assignments in 
different departments will also vary.  It is fundamentally unfair, for example, to expect the same 
amount of scho
larship and creative activity, ser
vice
, extension, or outreach from a faculty member 
teaching one class a semester as from another faculty member teaching three classes a semester or 
several large lecture classes.
 
 
C.
 
Equitable Treatment
:  
In order to ensure 
equitable treatment, every faculty member will complete 
an allocation of effort statement as part of the annual evaluation process.
  
(
See also 
Policy 5.20.20
)
 
 
When determining the allocation of effort, dec
isions must be made without regard to race, national 
origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual 
orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates.  Further, for the allocation of effor
t 
statement to be accurate and useful, administrators at all levels must understand and take an active 
role in avoiding institutional factors that could produce an undue burden on untenured faculty 
members and those from underrepresented groups in the allo
cation of effort process.
 
 
D.
 
Use of Allocation of Effort Statement
:  
Each college shall develop and use an allocation of effort 
statement as specified in Section 
5.90.5.1
.  These statements shall be a part of the faculty 
m

factored into the recommendation made at each step of the process.

An assistant professor is expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some 
segment of
 
the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole.
 
4.
 
Assistant professors are tenure
-
track faculty members hired on a yearly, renewable contract 
for a maximum of seven years.  
 
 
5.
 
During the sixth year, assistant professors typically are evaluated f
or promotion and tenure 
simultaneously, having submitted their portfolio at the beginning of that year.  
 
 
6.
 
However, an assistant professor may elect to apply for tenure or promotion at any time with 
the written approval of department head and dean or their
 
equivalents.  
 
 
7.
 
The application for tenure may occur only one time.
 
 
D.
 
Associate Professor
: 
 
 
 
1.
 
An associate professor is often a mid

career faculty member who has been awarded tenure. 
 
 
 
2.
 
If a faculty member is initially employed at the rank of associate 
professor without tenure, the 
probationary period may vary depending upon agreements stipulated in writing at the time of 
initial hire.  
 
 
3.
 
Once tenured, associate professors may hold this rank indefinitely or apply for promotion.  
 
 
4.
 
Promotion to professor 
should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years 
of ser

An associate professor must demonstrate competence, continuous progress, and maturity over 
a large part of the academic field.

It is expected that evidence showing high quality of teaching and scholarship and creative 
 
activity has been p
rovided and is current.

Flexibility in Tenure
-
Track
 
 
Normally, before being considered for tenure, eligible faculty members serve six consecutive 
probationary years.  The probationary period begins with the first year of the contract.  Note that   
according to 
Policy 5.98

-
track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in 
September (12
-
month employees) or the second Friday in October (9
-
month employees) will not 

ill be issued at the beginning of the next contract 
period, which will constitute the first year of the probationary period toward tenure.  During the sixth 
year, a case for tenure and/or promotion is made by the faculty member and considered by the 
univer
sity.
  
Those achieving tenure are awarded a continuous contract at the end of their sixth year, 
while those not awarded tenure are given a one
-
year terminal contract for their seventh and final year 
of employment at NMSU.  There may be exceptions, however,
 
to shorten or lengthen the normal six

5.90.3.6.2
 
Extension of the Probationary Period
 
 
When requested in writing within one year of the q
ualifying event by the faculty member, leaves of 
absence can lead to postponement of the tenure decision date; however, modifications in that date 
require the recommendation of the department head and dean and the approval of the 
executive
 
vice
-
president
 
a
nd 
provost
.  Faculty responsibilities may be negotiated when the extension is requested.  An 
extension may be granted up to two times, so long as the total pre
-
tenure probationary period does not 
exceed eight years.  Exceptions to this limit can be made un
der extraordinary circumstances if 
approved by the 
executive
 
vice
-
president
 
and 
provost
.  Candidates must be held to the same standards 
of performance when the probationary period has been extended as candidates whose probationary 
period was not extended. 
 
The probationary period may be extended, upon written request, under the 
following circumstances:
 
 
A.
 
Leave of Absence without Pay:
  
Probationary faculty members may request in writing a leave of 
absence without pay, usually not to exceed one academic or 
fiscal year.  Prior to initiating the 
leave, affected faculty may request in writing a probation extension of one year.
 
 
B.
 
Military Leave of Absence:
  
Involuntary induction into the armed forces entitles the faculty 
member to a leave of absence to cover t
he term of military ser

Probationary faculty members with a serious personal illness or 
providing prolonged, substantive care for a chronically ill family member may request in writing 
an extension of the tenure decision date, usually for one year.
 
 
D.
 
Family
 
Leave of Absence or Exceptional Family Responsibilities:
  
Upon written request, 
probationary faculty members who become parents will receive a one
-
year automatic extension of 
the tenure decision date.  Such an extension does not require that the faculty m
ember take a leave 
of absence.
 
 
E.
 
Catastrophic Events:
  
Probationary faculty who have experienced a catastrophic event such as a 
fire or flood or who must aid family members in such situations may request in writing an 
extension of the tenure decision dat

5.90.3.6.5
 
Joint Appointment (with Dual Primary Responsibilities)
 
 
In appropriate circumstances, a faculty member may be appointed in two departments or colleges.  The 
faculty member with a joint appointm
ent has a memorandum of understanding from all involved units.  
The memorandum of understanding stipulates the expected workload and allocation of effort 
distributed between the two departments; identifies the principal unit where tenure resides or will 
re
side if applicable; defines the responsibilities of the faculty member in each unit; and indicates the 
term of appointment.  The memorandum must explain the process for performance and promotion and 
tenure reviews, renewal of the joint appointment, and sal
ary increases.  Each unit must provide 
recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews.  In joint appointments with 
centers or institutes, the tenure home must reside in a principal unit.  In joint appointments with two or 
more acade
mic units, one unit must be designated, by mutual agreement, as the tenure home.

The NMSU library faculty is expected to meet 
university
 
requirements for academic appointment and 
promotion and tenure considerations.  For these purposes, the category of librarianship is equivalent to 
the teaching and advising category.  The NMS
U
 
Li
brary places the highest value on the element of 
librarianship.  Librarianship includes, but is not limited to the organization of knowledge, the 
understanding and use of technology as it relates to the information field, teaching, library

Criteria for Promotion and Tenure
 
 
When considering applicants for 
promotion and tenure, serious attenti
on will be given to performances
 
in the applicable areas of teaching and advising (or its equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, 
ser
vice
, extension and outreach
,
 
and where applicable, leadership.  The relative 
importance of each of 
these areas varies according to the cumulative allocation of effort statements.  Each area is vital to the 

 
ability to achieve its mission, and the performance of a faculty member will be viewed as 
an indication of future 
contributions.

advancement in r
ank.  The teaching and advising category includes all forms of 
university
-
level 
instructional activity, as well as advising undergraduate and graduate students, both within and 
outside the 
university
 
community.  Such activities are commonly characterized b
y the 

students to think critically and to apply knowledge to human problems; the integration and 
application of relevant domestic and international, social, politi
cal, economic, and ethical 
implications into class content; the preparation of students for careers in specific fields of study;

5.90.4.1.1
 
Evaluation of Teaching
 
 
A.
 
 
Evi
dence By Which Teaching Effectiveness is Assessed
: 
Teaching is a complex and multifaceted 
activity.  Therefore, several forms of evidence should be used to assess comprehensively teaching 
effectiveness.  Each form of evidence should carry a weight appropri
ate to its importance in 
evaluating teaching.
  
Such documentation must demonstrate command of subject matter, 
continuous growth, and development in the subject field, the ability to organize material and 
convey it effectively to students, assessment of stu
dent learning, revision and updates of curricula, 
and the integration of scholarship (for faculty who produce scholarship) and ser
vice
 
with teaching.  
Materials appropriate for evaluating teaching should include: (a) evidence from the instructor, (b) 
evide
nce from other professionals, (c) evidence from students, and (d) evidence of student 
learning.
 
 
B.
 
Principal Uni
ts To Develop 
Guidelines
: 
 
Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines for its 
teaching faculty that define teaching responsibilities and sp
ecify required evidence documenting 
teaching effectiveness.
  
Specific data to be included in the evaluation packet will be determined by 
each principal unit.
 
 
5.90.4.1.2
 
Evaluation of Advising
 
 
For promotion and tenure considerations, performance in such a
ctivities must be documented and 
evaluated.  Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities and 
documentation requirements for its faculty who advise.

Rationale
:  
Scholarship and creative activity involves discovering and creating, teaching and 
dissem
inating, and applying knowledge and skills to worldly concerns.  This understanding is 

processes, outcomes, and the passionate commitment of the professoriate a
nd others in the 
university
 
to disciplined inquiry and exploration in the development of knowledge and skills; (2) 
the scholarship of teaching involves dynamic, reciprocal, and critically reflective processes among 
teachers and learners at the 
university
 
a
nd in the community in which their activity and interaction 
enriches and transforms knowledge and skills, taught and learned; (3) the scholarship of 
engagement refers to the many and varied ways to responsibly offer and employ knowledge and 
skills to matte
rs of consequence to the 
university
 
and the community; and (4) the scholarship of 
integration is the process by which knowledge and skills are assessed, interpreted, and applied in 
new and creative ways to produce new, richer, and more comprehensive, insig
hts, understanding, 
and outcomes.

NMSU Definition of Scholarship and Creative Activity
:   
Scholarship and creative activity is both 
activity and product, employing dynamically interacting processes of discovery and creation, 
teaching and dissemination, en
gagement and application, and integration, in the pursuit of 
fulfilling the mission and vision of NMSU.  Products developed through these processes, are 
public, open to peer review, and available for use by others.  Scholarship and creative activity can

among faculty, staff, and students through which this mission is fulfilled.
 
 
D.
 
Use of Technology is a F
actor in Evaluation Categories
: 
The dissemination and creation of 
scholarly work using technology is becoming increasingly important.  Accordingly, it is important 

  
The 
rapid pace at which technology changes makes it difficult to use a single set of evaluation criteria 
to fit all cases encountered.  Technology often crosses the rigid boundaries of teaching and 
advising, scholarship and creative activity, ser
vice
, ex
tension, and outreach, and as such, it must 
be evaluated in as many of these categories as appropriate.  Flexibility in evaluation of the 

the candidate at the t
ime of hiring and during annual reviews and are encouraged to evaluate 
technology

based scholarship and creative activity using appropriate criteria.
 
 
5.90.4.2.1
 
Evaluation of Scholarship and Creative Activity
 
 
All scholarly activity and outcomes, regardle

Appropriate methods are used for the activity, including principles of honesty, integr
ity, and 
 
objectivity.  The methods have been chosen wisely, and applied effectively.  It allows for 
 
replication or elaboration.
 
 
D.
 
The activity achieves its goals and its outcomes have significant impact.  It adds 
 
consequentially 
 
to the field.  It breaks
 
new ground or is innovative.  It leads to further exploration
 
or new 
 
avenues 
 
for exploration for the scholar and for others.
 
 
E.
 
The activity and outcomes have been presented appropriately and effectively to its various 
 
audiences.

Extension and Outreach
 
 
Extension and outreach are essential to the 

 
mission because they disseminate information 
to the public; help the state by promot
ing economic development through the dissemination of new

technologies and best practices; and serve as a basis for sustainable, community
-
oriented, informal 
education that addresses local needs through faculty affiliated with each county government in New
 
Mexico.  The central role of extension and outreach is recognized in that several principal units are 
dedicated to these functions.  There are also numerous faculty members in other units for whom 
extension and outreach are major components of their dutie
s.
 
 
5.90.4.3.1
 
Evaluation of Extension and Outreach
 
 
A.
 
Collaborative Effort
:  
Extension and outreach work is collaborative by nature.  Faculty should 
provide evidence of collaboration with whomever necessary to identify local needs, garner 
resources, discove
r and adapt new knowledge, design and deliver programs, assess clientele skill 
changes, and communicate program results.  Collaborative effort should also include networking 
with other 
university
 
faculty in identified areas of program discovery, developmen
t, and delivery, 
including applications to teaching and advising where appropriate.  
 
 
B.
 
Evaluation Guidelines
: 
To evaluate extension and outreach scholarship the following guidelines 
are recommended
:
 
 
1.
 
Faculty must provide evidence of extension and outreach 
scholarship in order that 
these 
[collaborative] 
efforts are recognized.  
 
 
2.
 
The documentation should provide evidence that the work is: 
 
 
a.
 
creative and intellectual; 
 
b.
 
validated by peers; 
 
c.
 
communicated to stakeholders; and 
 
d.
 
have an impact on stakeholders and 
the region.
 
 
3.
 
Components of extension scholarship include: 
 
 
a.
 
developing programs based on locally identified needs, concerns, and/or issues; targeting 
specific audiences; 
 
b.
 
setting goals and objectives for the program; 
 
c.
 
reviewing current literature and/or re
search for the program; 
 
d.
 
planning appropriate program delivery; 
 
e.
 
documenting changes in clientele knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and/or skills; 
 
f.
 
conducting a reflective critique and/or evaluation of the program; 
 
g.
 
validation of the program by peers and/or
 
stakeholders;
 
and
 
h.
 
communication of results to stakeholders and decision makers.
 
 
5.90.4.4
 
Ser
vice
 
 
Ser
vice
 
is an essential component of the 

 
mission and 
requires that the faculty member 
contribute to the organization and development of the 
uni
versity,
 
as well as provide ser
vice
 
to any 

professional knowledge and skills.
 
 
5.90.4.4.1
 
Evaluation of Ser
vice
 
 
The type and amount of ser
vice
 
that 
a faculty member performs should be determined in consultation 
with the appropriate administrator(s).  
All relevant activities in which a faculty member participates 
should receive appropriate consideration for promotion and tenure decisions.  Ser
vice
 
cont
ributions 
should be evaluated based on how they are applied and how they draw upon the professional expertise 
of the faculty member.
 
 
5.90.4.5
 
Leadership
 
 
In demonstrating leadership, candidates must show that they are having an impact as evidenced by the

Reassignment of Administrators/Department Heads
 
 
Due to the larger scope of responsibility of most administrative positions, the reassignment of an 
administrator with faculty rank to a faculty position normally results in a reduction
 
of salary.  Several 
factors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of faculty salaries in the 
department where the reassignment occurs. Normally, department heads who have less than 4 
complete years return to 75 percent of 
their base salaries (not including department head increment), 
and department heads who serve 4 or more years return to 80 percent of their base salaries.  Again, 
several factors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of fac
ulty salaries 
in the department where the reassignment occurs.

Research Philosophy
:
  
Research is an important component of every academic activity, and is, 
therefore, the source of content for quality instr
uctional programs.  New Mexico State University 
recognizes research as essential to the vitality of the university and undertakes the support of 
research as part of its institutional responsibility.  The mission statement expresses the importance 
of resear


land
-

comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, an
d public service
.  
 
The university promotes academic inquiry and protects academic freedom for those engaged in it.  
This includes the support of research and off
-
campus study as potentially valuable experiences for 
faculty and students.  These experiences
 
may take the form of sabbaticals, internships, intensive 
study of specialized techniques, and conducting research at specialized facilities.  These 
opportunities offer researchers considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable 
contacts am
ong faculty members, students, the university, industry and other research institutions.  
 
 
B.
 
Protections in Research Involving Human Subjects
:
 
It is the policy of the university to protect the 
rights, well being, and personal privacy of individuals particip
ating in research projects, while also 
maintaining a favorable climate for the conduct of scientific inquiry and protecting the interests of 
the university. The university has established the Institutional Review Board to regulate the 
participation of huma
n subjects in research, consistent with federal law.  (
See
 
5.94.30 D
. below.)  

 
NMSU Policy Manual                                                              
                                                                                                
Chapter

All research conducted at or by the university, regardless of funding source, shall adhere to the 
requirements of the Institutional R
eview Board and the following tenets:  
 
 
1.
 
The university, including its faculty, staff, contractors and student body shall be responsible 
for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects. 
 
 
2.
 
No human subject involved in a research activity shal
l be exposed to unreasonable risk to 
health or well
-

-
being.  
 
 
3.
 
All participation by human subjects shall be voluntary; no subject will be coerced in any way 
to participate in a rese
arch project.  A request by any subject to withdraw from a research 
activity shall be honored promptly without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled, within the limits of the research.  
 
 
4.
 
The confidentiality of information 
received from subjects in experiments or respondents to 
questionnaires shall be protected, both during and after the conduct of a research activity, 
consistent with applicable law.  
 
 
5.
 
In research which involves more than minimal risk, or which involves sub
stantial stress or 
discomfort, such risk, stress or discomfort shall be carefully explained in advance to the 
subject.  The researcher(s) shall be satisfied that the explanation has been understood by the 
subject, and that the written consent of the subjec
t, is obtained and kept as a matter of record.  
The researcher(s) shall be responsible for ensuring that method used to obtain informed 
consent (written, audio
-
recorded, witnessed) is the most appropriate for the participant, and 
for providing appropriate 
evidence of informed consent consistent with the approval granted 
by the Institutional Review Board and with applicable federal law.  
 
 
6.
 
Research involving special subject populations (e.g., persons under the age of 18, or mentally 
disabled or disadvantaged
 
persons) may be conducted as long as a qualified guardian signs the 
consent form.  
 
 
C.
 
Protections in Research Involving the Use of Animals
:
 
As a land grant institution, it is the 

use of animals in the 
service of man, and to advance human and animal welfare.  Consistent with applicable law and 
regulations, the university supports the use of animals in research, education, and as agricultural 
resources, provided that the usage is rea
sonably expected to advance knowledge about human or 

applicable to animal use.  
 
 
The university has established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Co
mmittee to administer 
policies and procedures regarding university care and use of vertebrate animals.  (
See 
5.94.30
 
E. 
below)  Any concerns regarding the use or care of animals by the institution should be
 
addressed 
to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  
 
 
D.

[Amendment 
recommended 
by Administrative Council 
09.13.11; 
a
pproved by Board of Regents 10.10.11]
 
 
Research units, including but not limited to the Physi
cal Science Laboratory, receive many 
sponsored awards in which information provided by the sponsor or generated by or in connection 
with the research effort may be considered sensitive:  classified, controlled unclassified, and/or 
proprietary. Units keepin
g or using sensitive information should adopt appropriate procedures for 
its protection
 
and train faculty, staff, and students whose positions require access to such 
information. All employees shall comply with applicable laws, university policy, and contr
actual 
agreements regarding non
-
disclosure of sensitive information.

Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research
 
 
A.
 
Definition of Research Misconduct
:
 
Research misconduct is academic misconduct, dishonest 
behavior, or any form of unethical practices involving an act of deception whereby one's 
work or 
the work of others is misrepresented.  Other terms, such as research fraud or scientific misconduct, 
are subsumed within the term academic misconduct.  Research misconduct is distinguished from 
honest error and from ambiguities of interpretation th
at are inherent in the scientific process.  The 
principal element of research misconduct is the intent to deceive others or misrepresent one's 
work.  Research misconduct may also involve wrongful acts or omissions relating to non
-
compliance with applicable
 
law or regulation, a failure to report known misconduct or retaliation 
against others involved in the reporting, investigation or correcting misconduct.  Research 
misconduct may take numerous forms such as, but not limited to:  
 
 
1.
 
Falsification of Data
:
  
F
abrication, willful suppression and/or distortion of data with the intent 
to falsify results.  
 
 
2.
 
Plagiarism
:
  
The use of the work of another without proper acknowledgment.  
 
 
3.
 
Improprieties of Authorship
:
  
Improper assignment of credit, such as excluding ot
her authors, 
inclusion of individuals as authors who have not made a definite contribution to the work 
published, or submission of multi
-
authored publications without the concurrence of all 
authors.  
 
 
4.
 
Misappropriation of the Ideas of Others
:
  
Unauthorized
 
use of privileged information (such as 
violation of confidentiality in peer review), however obtained.  
 
 
5.
 
Violation of Generally Accepted Research Practices
:
  
Deceptive practices in proposing, 
conducting, or reporting research.  
 
 
6.
 
Material Failure to Comp
ly with Governmental Requirements
:
  
Serious, repeated, willful 
violations of governmental requirements arising from law, statute, regulation, or agreement.  
Regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the use of funds, care of animals, 
hum
an subjects, and biological, chemical, pharmacological, and radiological materials.  
 
 
7.
 
Inappropriate Behavior in Relation to Research Misconduct
:
  
Unjust and malicious 
accusation(s) of misconduct, failure to report misconduct, withholding or destruction of
 
information or evidence relevant to a claim of misconduct, or malicious retaliation against 
persons involved in the allegation or investigation of misconduct.  
 
 
B.
 
Scope of Policy
:
  
This policy applies throughout the university system to faculty, staff and 
students involved in research and research
-
related work regulated by federal law or sponsored 
externally.  Such research includes, but is not limited to, research involving human subjects, 
vertebrate animals, biohazardous agents and/or recombinant DNA.  Re
search projects involving 
the surveying of other students, university personnel, or members of the general public fall within 
the scope of this policy, unless exempted by federal law.  Academic misconduct alleged against a 
student generally will not be cov
ered by this policy, unless it falls within the above scope, and will 
instead be addressed pursuant to the 
Academic Misconduct
 
policy housed in the 
Student 
Handbook
. 
 
 
 
C.
 
Duty to Report
:
 
Individuals wi
th a reasonable factual basis to believe that a researcher has 
committed an act of research misconduct prohibited by this policy are obligated to report such 
occurrences to a supervisor not involved in the alleged misconduct.  Such reports of suspected 
res
earch misconduct shall be forwarded to the vice president for research for prompt investigation, 
and subsequent corrective action and reporting, if warranted by the investigative findings.  If the 
reporter, the supervisor, or the vice president have reason
 
to suspect that a crime may have been 
committed, the report shall also be made to the NMSU Police or other appropriate law 
enforcement for a separate and distinct criminal investigation
.

Preliminary Internal Invest
igation
:
  
If an appropriate oversight committee (Institutional Review 
Board, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, or 
Radiation Safety Committee) reports misconduct substantiated by an investigation with factual 
fi
ndings, this shall serve as the internal preliminary investigation.  
 
In all other cases, the vice president for research will refer the reported matter to the appropriate 
college dean and associate dean for research, or equivalents, to conduct a prelimina
ry internal 
investigation into the alleged misconduct.  The investigation will be conducted confidentially.  
 
 
Within twenty (20) business days from the initial receipt of the report of potential academic 
misconduct, the evidence and any recommended findin
gs shall be forwarded to the vice president 
for research.  During the preliminary investigation stage, the funding agency will not be notified, 
except as may be otherwise required by law or written agreement.  
 
 
E.
 
Action on Results of Preliminary Investigati
on
:
  
The vice president for research shall consider the 
evidence and the recommended findings of the preliminary investigation, and initiate further 
action as follows within twenty (20) business days from the date the evidence and the findings 
were receive
d.  
 
 
1.
 
If the vice president for research concludes that no infraction occurred, the matter will be 
dismissed.  This decision, including all supporting documentation, will be reported to the 
O
ffice of 
U
niversity 
G
eneral 
C
ounsel.  
 
 
2.
 
If the vice president for
 
research concludes that an infraction occurred, but was not an 
unanticipated problem, did not involve serious or continuing non
-
compliance with federal 
regulations or university policy, and did not involve a suspension or termination of an 
approval grante
d by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research will 
refer the matter to the college dean or appropriate vice president for disciplinary action or 
other administrative corrective action, as warranted by the factual findings.  
 
 
3.
 
If
 
the vice president for research concludes that the matter may involve an unanticipated 
problem, a serious or continuing non
-
compliance issue, or a suspension or termination of an 
approval granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president 
for research shall 
refer the matter for a confidential formal investigation, at which time the funding agency 
and/or the appropriate federal or state oversight agency will be notified by way of an Initial 
Report.  The Initial Report shall indicate that eit
her follow up reports or a final report, or both, 
will be forthcoming as soon as practicable under the circumstances.  
 
 
4.
 
If the vice president for research concludes that a crime may be implicated, the matter shall be 
immediately reported to the appropriat
e law enforcement agency for a separate and distinct 
criminal investigation.  
 
 
F.
 
Formal Investigation
:
  
The confidential formal investigation will be conducted by an ad hoc 
committee to be convened and chaired by the vice president for research.  The commit
tee shall 
consist of the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research or equivalents, the 
appropriate department head, and three faculty or exempt staff members from the University 
Research Council, selected by the university research council c
hair. Substitutions, in the event of 
conflict of interest, will be made by the vice president for research or the executive vice president 
and provost, as appropriate.  This formal investigation should be completed within two months 
from the date the commi
ttee is formed.  The committee shall gather relevant documentation; 
interview witnesses with relevant testimony, including the person charged with the misconduct; 
preserve any physical evidence; and prepare an investigative report summarizing all evidence 
in 
the form of factual findings.  The final draft investigative report shall be shared with the person 
charged with the misconduct, and that person shall be given a minimum of five business days to 
respond.  
 
 
G.
 
Action on Results of Formal Investigation
:
  
Co
nsistent with the results of the formal investigation, 
the vice president for research and/or the appropriate college dean or vice president shall take 
appropriate, university
-
wide corrective action to ensure that similar incidents do not recur, and

to be taken.  
 
 
H.
 
Notifications and Record Retention
:
  
All documentation of the preliminary inquiry and formal 
investigation, if any, shall be maintained in the offi
ce of the vice president for research for at least 
three (3) years and must, upon request, be provided to authorized government personnel.  The 
university shall comply with notification requirements imposed by funding agency regulations and 
agreements.  
 
 
I.
 
Anti
-
Retaliation
:
 
 
In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good 
faith, report reasonably suspected academic misconduct in research, the university prohibits 
retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any 
person who cooperates in the 
investigative process.  A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a 
separate internal investigation to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource 
Services, and if substant
iated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination of employment.  
 
 
J.
 
False or Unfounded Complaints
:
 
If the preliminary or formal investigative report reflects that the 
complaint of academic misconduct in research was not substa
ntiated, the university will make 
efforts to restore the reputations of the researcher who was accused of having engaged in 
misconduct.  Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a 
separate internal investigation in th
e event the investigative report indicates that the initial 
complaint or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation, may have been intentionally 
falsified.  If deliberate falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it wi
ll be 
grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of 
employment.

bmitted to the Intellectual Property Office to explore the feasibility of the university 
assisting with the protection and commercialization of the intellectual property.  The 
university will require some consideration for such assistance, such as an assig
nment, a 
license (with the right to sublicense), or the right to receive royalties or other earnings, as 
mutually agreed upon between the parties.  The originator and the university must negotiate 
and sign a written agreement before the university will ass
ist the originator.

Funding of Intellectual Property
:
  
Patentable intellectual property developed under the 
sponsorship of a federal agency is subject to federal policy as detailed in P/L/
 
96
-
157 (35 
U.S.C. 200).  This law allows grantees and/or cont
ractors to take title to inventions made in 
the course of their federally
-
funded research.  To enjoy the full benefits of this law, the 
Intellectual Property Officer will:  
 
 
a.
 
Inform the sponsoring federal agency of an invention within two months of disc
losure of 
invention to the Intellectual Property Officer.  
 
b.
 
Elect within 12 months of disclosure whether the university wants title rights.  
 
c.
 
File a patent application within two years of electing title or by the expiration of the 
patent filing deadl
ine in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  
 
d.
 
Grant a royalty
-
free license to the federal government within 6 months after filing a 
patent application.  
 
e.
 
Provide the federal government with annual reports on utilization of federally supported 
invent
ions administered by the university.

Research Funding and Research Institutes
:
 
 
1.
 
State University Research Fund
:
  
The State University Research Fund is the designated 
university fund where indirect (facilities and administrative) cost reco
very earned by the 
university is deposited.  Funds to support academic research from the State University 
Research Fund are relatively scarce and must be used in a variety of ways (
e.g
., to support 
research, to stimulate new research, to support public ser
vice, and to support scholarly 
endeavors as well as the necessary administration).  In general, it is desirable to keep the 
administrative costs at a minimum and, therefore, make available to the faculty as much 
support as possible for nonrecurring researc
h expenses.  It is the underlying philosophy to use 
this research support in a flexible manner in keeping with college and department priorities.  
Encouragement is given to the faculty to secure outside support for research, at the same time 
recognizing th
at it is important to provide some support to scholarly pursuits which may not 
attract outside funding.  
 
 
 
University Research Institutes
:
  
 
 
a.
 
University Research Institutes are units that primarily perform externally funded 
research.  They are formed by t
he vice president for research in consultation with the 
executive vice president and provost.  Generally, these units will report to the vice 
president for research; at the time of creating the institute, the reporting line for the unit 
shall be determined
 
by the executive vice president and provost and the vice president for 
research.  
 
b.
 
University Research Institutes may be created by the university in anticipation of outside 
funding.  They revert to college status or cease to exist if external funding doe
s not 
materialize.  A University Research Institute may receive some support from the State 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

University Research Fund.  Except for the Physical Science Laboratory and the Water 
Resources Research Institute, University Research Institutes do not directly ret
ain a 
percentage of indirect cost recovery resulting from their activity.  
 
c.
 
Upon the recommendation of the vice president for research with concurrence of the 
executive vice president and provost, a University Research Institute may revert to 
College Resea
rch Institute status, be reorganized, or be dissolved, and the following list 
modified accordingly.  University Research Institutes, all of which currently report to the 
vice president for research, are listed below.

College Research Institutes
:
  
College Research Institutes are research units formed at the 
discretion of a college, reporting to the 
college as the dean directs, and relying on the college 
for support.  College Research Institutes do not directly retain a percentage of any indirect 
cost recovery resulting from their activity.

Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project Awards
 
 
A.
 
Administrative Responsibility
:
  
 
 
1.
 
Principal Investigator Defined
:
  
The principal investigator is the individual responsible for the 
intellectual direction of a research project and the tr
aining of graduate students.  This 
responsibility includes the conduct of the project, fiscal and administrative accountability, and 
adherence to the requirements of all relevant laws, regulations, policies, procedures and 
agreements.  If a project has mul
tiple investigators (lead principal investigator and co
-
principal investigators), they shall share the responsibility and accountability for leading and 
directing the project, both intellectually and logistically.  
 
 
2.
 
Eligibility to Serve as a Principal Inv
estigator
:
  
Eligibility to serve as a principal investigator 
on an externally sponsored award is generally limited to those regular employees of the 
university including: (a) those with faculty rank, including college faculty and research 
faculty as well a
s administrators with faculty rank such as (but not limited to) the president, 
executive vice president and provost, vice presidents, deans, and associate deans, and (b) 
research and development technical staff.  There may be instances when it is in the be
st 
interest of the university to have other persons serve as principal investigators, such as 
temporary employees, affiliated faculty or emeritus faculty.  Exceptions to the requirements 
that a principal investigator must have both (a) regular employee sta
tus and (b) either faculty 
rank or employment as research and development technical staff may be made with written 
approval of both the relevant dean or director, and the vice president for research.  A student 
may serve as a co
-
principal investigator, but
 
may not serve as the lead principal investigator 
on a project.  
 
 
B.
 
Sponsored Project Proposal Process
:
 
 
1.
 
Proposal Preparation
:
  
Proposal preparation is the responsibility of principal investigators and 
their units, working in cooperation with the Office of 
Grants and Contracts.  The 
Proposal/Award Form or a similar automated system, as designated by the vice president for 
research, will be used by all principal investigators and project directors seeking externally 
sponsored project funding. This form will b
e processed in the early stages of proposal 
development.  This is a mandatory form, and no research proposal will be signed or sent out 
from the university unless this form is signed by the appropriate administrative officers or 
designated representatives.
  
Responsibility for proposal preparation includes developing 
budgets consistent with relevant cost accounting standards and obtaining appropriate 
certifications, permits (
e.g
., for drug use), and permissions 
(e.g.
, use of humans and animals in 
research). 
 
 
 
2.
 
Proposal Submission
:
  
Proposal submission is the sole responsibility of the Office of the Vice 
President for Research.  Principal investigators should timely submit funding proposals 
through their unit to the Office of Grants and Contracts, with suffici
ent advance notice to 
allow for their proper review, approval and submission to funding agencies.
 
 
C.
 
Acceptance of Sponsored Project Award
:
  
Award documents are received by the Office of Grants 
and Contracts for final review, negotiation and formal acceptanc
e.  Only the vice president for 
research (or designee) has the authority to accept an award, negotiate and to sign award 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

agreements related to sponsored programs, including amendments, modifications, budget changes, 
principal investigator changes, and exte
nsions to existing agreements.  
 
 
D.
 
Maintenance of Sponsored Project Records
:
  
Records of sponsored project awards and related 
certifications, permits and permissions, as well as of non
-
financial deliverable reports to sponsors, 
are maintained by the Office 
of the Vice President for Research through the Office of Grants and 
Contracts.  This includes coordinating the production, submission and retention of reports and 
records generated in the closeout of sponsored award agreements.  Financial records of sponso
red 
awards and related reports, invoices and financial reports, are maintained by the Office of 
Administration and Finance, primarily through the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.  
 
 
E.
 
Accountability for Sponsored Award Transactions
:
  
Transactions on spo
nsored project awards 
shall be approved by the principal investigator and the dean, director, or designee of the college or 
other unit.  The Sponsored Projects Accounting Office, in cooperation with the principal 
investigators and their respective units, f
iscally monitors sponsored awards, reviews and prepares 
financial reports, and receives and disburses funds.  
 
 
F.
 
Accountability for Property Acquired Through a Sponsored Project Award
:
  
The principal 
investigator, department head, dean or director, and univ
ersity property administrator shall be 
accountable for acquisitions and dispositions of equipment and other property acquired through 
sponsored project awards.  Any such property will be recorded on the university's inventory at a 
minimum, for property to 
which the university does not acquire title, until the expiration of the 
award period.  A determination as to whether title to property acquired under sponsored awards 
vests with the sponsor or with the university at the end of the award period should be i
ncluded in 
the award agreement, rather than negotiated at award termination.  The university property 
administrator will be kept informed of any amendment to the initial determination regarding 

updated and the necessary final 
property reports prepared.

A.
 
Tenure Home
:  
Tenure at the 
university
 
is placed in a specific department/program/community 
college where the criteria for 
each individual's tenure are established.  
Tenure at the community 
college
 
means at the community college, not on the main campus.  There is no obligation to bring 
the person to the main campus if 

 
position ceases to 
exist at the community coll
ege.
  
 
 
B.
 
Initial Appointment
:  
Excerpts from this manual regarding promotion and tenure will be presented 
to each new member of the faculty* prior to appointment and 

acceptance of 
an appointment indicates understanding and acceptance of
 
the provisions of the contract as 
specified in this manual.  Information regarding social security, retirement, hospitalization, 
disability, and life insurance will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to 
appointment and acceptance
 
of the conditions of employment.  The patent policy for the 
university
 
staff will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to appointment, and 
acceptance of the appointment indicates understanding and acceptance of this policy.

)
:  
Contracts which cover an employment period of either 9 months or 12 months are issued as 
follows:
 
 
 
1.
 
Contracts are issued to full
-
time tenure
-
track faculty members.* Full
-
ti
me is interpreted to 
apply to tenure
-
track faculty members who are released no more than 1/4  time to duties other 
than academic and/or research programs and/or academic administration.  Unless prior 
approval for exception is obtained from the department h
ead, dean, and 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
, it will be considered that all other faculty are less than full
-
time and 
occupy nontenure
-
track positions. 
 
 
2.
 
Nine
-
month contracts cover the period from the opening faculty meeting in the fall to the date
 
final grade reports are due for the spring semester; 12
-
month contracts are issued effective 
July 1 and terminate on June 30 of the following year.  Temporary contracts are presumed to 
end at the conclusion of the stated term.  The terms shall be stated i
n contractual form and a 
copy retained by the university and the appointee.
 
 
3.
 
New tenure
-
track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in September (12
-
month 
employees) or the second Friday in October (9
-
month employees) will not receive a 
temporar
y contract.  Instead, the dean will prepare an agreement for the new faculty member's 
signature covering employment for the remainder of the year (this form to be submitted with 
the initial Personnel Action Form).  The first contract will be issued at the 
beginning of the 
next contract period, which will constitute the first year of the probationary period toward 
tenure. 
 
 
*Interpreted as including all tenure
-
track and tenured members of the instruction staff and the 
Agricultural Experiment Station staff; a
ll Cooperative Extension Ser
vice
 
state staff members; the 
Research Centers' staffs; and any others whom the 
Board of Regents
 
may designate.
 
 
D.
 
Probationary Period
:  The probationary
 
period
 
[may also be referred to as the trial, or provisional 
period] 
(1 year
 
at a time) for personnel with or without previous experience agreed upon from 
other institutions of higher education will ordinarily not exceed 6 years.  At the discretion of the 
administration, the trial period may be shortened.  Thereafter, there shall 
be a presumption of 
permanence in employment and the requirement of cause as indicated below assigned for 
dismissal.
 
 
E.
 
Nonrenewal of Contracts and Termination of Appointment:
 
 
In the process of evaluating 
performance and issuing temporary contracts, it may 
be necessary not to renew a temporary 
contract. 
 
 
1.
 
During the trial period, non
-
renewal of the contract may be without implication of criticism or

2.
 
The reason for non
-
renewal will be stated, if so requested by the faculty member sub
ject to 
non
-
renewal. The reason is only to be communicated if requested by the faculty member. The 
choice of the manner of notification (verbally or in writing) is to be made by the faculty 
member. The faculty member must request the reason for non
-
renewal
 
prior to the end of the 

 
 
3.
 
Prior to non
-
renewal, the 
d
epartment 
h
ead, or comparable administrator, must consult with the 
promotion and tenure committee of the department before any recommendation of non
-
renewal is forwarded to th
e dean. The consultation is to be in the form of a meeting and the 
d
epartment 
h
ead or comparable administrator must identify the faculty member(s) at risk for 
non
-
renewal. In addition, the department head or comparable administrator must provide the 
commit
tee with all relevant information, to the extent allowed by law, related to the non
-
renewal. 
 
 
4.
 
Notification of the non
-
renewal of short
-
term or non
-
continuous appointment is made in 
writing according to the following schedule: 
 
 
a.
 
for faculty members in thei
r first year of ser
vice
 
at this 
university
 

 
3 months or more 
before the end date of their contract; 
 
b.
 
for faculty members in their second year of ser
vice
 
at this 
university
 

 
6 months or more 
before the end date of their contract; 
 
c.
 
for faculty members who 
will have 3 or more years of ser
vice
 
at this 
university
 
at the 
time of nonrenewal 

 
1 year or more before the end date of their contract. 
 
 
A Contract Status Form must be processed by the department head for the nonrenewal of a 
temporary contract prior to 
the deadlines established for notification. The employee should 
acknowledge receipt of such notification by dating, signing, and returning the Contract Status 
Form. 
 
 
F.
 
Voluntary Termination of a Temporary Contract
:  Any staff member who proposes to resign s
hall 
give written notice to the administration at the earliest time possible, but in no case later than 30 
days after the staff member receives written notification of the terms of the next year's contract, or 
3 months prior to the start of the following a
cademic year, whichever is later, except when 
mutually agreed upon by the individual and the administration.  The faculty member should 
inform the department head in writing.  The department head will inform the dean, who in turn 
will notify the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  The department head should then submit a 
terminating Personnel Action Form at the earliest possible date.  If death is the reason for 
termination, payment will be made for all unused annual leave accrued at the time of death to
 
a 
maximum of 52 working days of leave.  If a person listed by the promotion and tenure committee 
does not wish to be considered for promotion or tenure, the person must so indicate to the 
department head in writing.  
However, if the person is in the fifth
 
year of tenure
-
track ser
vice
, 
withdrawal from consideration for tenure must be accompanied by written notice of resignation 
effective at the end of the sixth year of ser
vice
 
(this notice to be received by the department head 
before the end of the fifth ye
ar of ser
vice
)
.  
 
 
G.
 
Involuntary Termination of a Temporary Contract
:  
See
 
5.47 Faculty Discipline
 
 
 
H.
 
Change to Continuous Contract
:  The department head initiates the Contract Status Form to 
accomplis
h the change from temporary to continuous contract.  All recommendations for tenure 
must be accompanied by notification to the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
from the dean of 
the result of the faculty committee vote.  When tenure is awarded, it is aw
arded in the unit that 
initiated the request for tenure (continuous contract).  No temporary appointment can become 
continuous without the official action of the 
university
 
administration.
 
 
I.
 
Continuous Contracts
: A continuous appointment is not a matter of 
right, but is made after the 
provisional period has been completed successfully, providing the individual's ser
vice
s are needed.  
Such an appointment is made by the issuance of a new contract at the time of continuous 

 
NMSU Policy Manual                                                              
                                                                                                
Chapter

of

appointment or shortly thereafter, and
 
the contract becomes the abiding instrument governing 
employment, except that the terms may be modified from time to time by endorsement.  
Continuous contracts are issued by the Office of the 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
Pr
esident
 
and 
P
rovost
 
following receipt of an ap
proved Contract Status Form.  Continuous contracts are not reissued 
until there is a promotion in rank.  Each spring an official contract amendment (salary letter) is 
issued by the 
president

 
office which informs the faculty member of final performance ev
aluation 
and annual salary for the ensuing year.  Once a faculty member has been appointed to a continuous 
contract, that faculty member will retain continuous contract status even though the faculty 
member accepts appointment at less than full time.
 
 
J.
 
Tran
sfers
:  Normally there are four types of transfers of faculty members within various agencies 
of the 
university
:
 
 
 
1.
 
A faculty member leaving an instructional/research department to serve in a different 
instructional/research department.  Under these circ
umstances, the individual may be given 
credit toward a continuous contract for the years served in the earlier department.  With 
proper departmental and college vote, and the completion of a Contract Status Form by the 
new department, tenure may be transfe
rred with a faculty member from one department to 
another.
 
 
2.
 
The transfer of a faculty member from a non
-
instructional division to an instructional division 
or 
vice
 
versa.  Under these circumstances, years of ser
vice
 
in the prior position will not 
necess
arily count toward a continuous contract in the new position.  Proven performance in 
the first position, under these circumstances, might not assure that the individual would be 
able to render satisfactory professional ser
vice
 
in the new area of assignment
.
 
 
3.
 
The transfer of a faculty member from the 
university
 
community college campuses to an 
instructional division on the main campus or 
vice
 
versa.  Under these circumstances, years of 
ser
vice
 
in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a cont
inuous contract in the new 
position or assure appointment in an equivalent rank.  Proven performance in the community 
college or main campus position might not assure that the individual meets the rank 
requirements of the new position.

.
 
The transfer of 
a faculty member from one community college to another
:
  
Under these 
circumstances, the individual may be given credit towards a continuous contract and rank for 
the years in the previous community college.

A.
 
Definition of Academic Unit
:  
For 
the purpose of this policy an academic unit is defined as a 
college, a department, an undergraduate major, a graduate degree program, or a library, whether 
these units are located on the main or a 
community college
.  
 
 
B.
 
Reviews/Recommendations and Approvals
 
Required
:  
Any proposal to create, reorganize, relocate 
or eliminate an academic unit must be submitted for review and recommendation by the Faculty 
Senate, the Academic Deans Council, and the 
president
 
to the 
Board of Regents
 
for their 
consideration and 
action. 
 
 
C.
 
Initiation of Proposal to Create, Reorganize, Relocate or Eliminate an Academic Unit
:  
Proposals 
to create, reorganize, relocate, or eliminate an academic unit formally originate with a bill 
submitted to the Faculty Senate.  The proposed legislat
ion shall follow the procedure specified in 
Faculty Senate Constitution ARTICLE IX Propositions for Consideration of the Constitution of 
the Faculty Senate, except that no such proposal will be considered as emergency legislation.  
 
 
D.
 
Effective Date
 
of Chan
ge
:  
If approved, the creation of a department will be effective either 
January
 
1 or July
 
1 following the approval.
 
 
E.
 
Procedure for Implementation
:  
After approvals from the appropriate authorizing bodies are 
obtained (
i.e
., Faculty Senate, Academic Deans C
ouncil, etc.), the requesting department 
head/director must submit an Organization Change Request Form to the Office of Human 
Resource Ser
vice
s for processing.  The form must be submitted with all relevant documentation 
attached no later than November 30 (
for January 1 effective date) and May 31 (for July 1 effective 
date).
 
 
F.
 
Creation of New Colleges
:  The creation of a new college is a decision based on the weighing of a 
number of criteria, including those below.  An attitude of flexibility, reality, and or
ganizational 
feasibility should be maintained in applying these criteria.  The structure of the entire 
university,
 
if 
a new college is formed, is an important consideration. 
 
 
1.
 
There should be a documented professional need for the college in the state a
nd region.
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:  This can be expressed through increasing student enrollment in programs that 
would be part of the new college, or an obvious need for professional graduates of the 
college as expressed by state and local groups who desire to hire
 
these professions. 
 
 
2.
 
The proposed college should be of a recognized profession or group of disciplines.
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:
  
The new college should give a desirable added professional recognition and 
development in the area of the new college.
 
 
3.
 
At the ou
tset, the new college shall have a minimum student enrollment of 250 with 
demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 500 within a 3
-
 
to 5
-
year period and a 
sufficient number of faculty to make it a viable administrative unit within the 
university.
  
 
 
a
.
 
Rationale:
  
After several development years, the quantity of faculty and students should 
be sufficient to lend themselves to a quality of organization, instruction, and ser
vice
 
that 
will provide a viable thrust to the 
university.
 
 
 
 
The quality and quant
ity of the faculty in the proposed college should be capable of 
maintaining with distinction an academic undergraduate and graduate program.

4.
 
The 
university
 
must be willing to make the commitment to furnish financial support for an 
additional
 
college. 
 
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:
  
This should include an adequate budget to provide for an expanding staff at 
the college level and funds for additional housing at a professional level.  
 
 
G.
 
Changing a Department or Group of Departments into a School
:  The proposed school shou
ld 
incorporate more than one area of specialization or should offer more than one degree (may 
include interdisciplinary cooperative efforts or more than one department).  The proposed school 
should be an administrative and support unit with undergraduates 
and graduate students and an 
established, nationally recognized teaching and research program.  The administrative head of a 

equal to that of a department h
ead.  The legislation must contain a clearly stated and convincing 
justification for the name change, and must have support of the department and college faculty and 
administration.
 
 
H.
 
New Academic Unit
:  There should be a documented academic/educational nee
d for the academic 
unit, including but not limited to, an increasing student enrollment or significant employment 
opportunities for graduates in that field.  The new program(s) should be consistent with the 
mission of the 
university
 
and the college in whic
h it will be located.  There are sufficient faculty 
and resources to staff the program.
 
 
I.
 
Relocation or Reorganizing an Academic Unit
:  Proposals to relocate a department must meet all 
of the following criteria:
 
 
1.
 
The relocation will produce a more homogenou
s set of programs and departments in both 
colleges.
 
 
2.
 
The relocation will enhance the professional identity of the
 
program or department involved
 
 
3.
 
The relocation will not cause undue hardship for other academic units.
 
 
4.
 
The faculty and administrators directl
y affected are in agreement.
 
 
5.
 
Such a change will better serve the 
university
 
community, clients, and/or the mission of the 
university.
 
 
6.
 
Address the transfer of resources, courses taught, and the faculty rank and tenure (or years to 
tenure) of those individ
uals being transferred.
 
 
7.
 
If a unit is being relocated to another college, there should be significant support from the unit 
being transferred and the unit receiving the transferred personnel/resources.
 
 
J.
 
Elimination of an Academic Unit
:  (
See
 
also
 
Policy 4.40, Layoff/Financial Exigency
) Proposals to 
eliminate an academic unit must meet the following criteria:
 
 
1.
 
A significant decline in enrollment, either as measured by number of majors or student credit 
hours.
 
 
2.
 
The reso
urces are needed by programs or departments with much higher enrollment or student 
credit hour production.
 
 
3.
 

teaching, research, and ser
vice
 
shall be considered.
 
 
K.
 
Undergraduate Program Changes
:  (
See
 
Curricula
 
Changes
) All undergraduate program changes, 
including those of associate degrees, will be reported by the appropriate college representative at 
the fall curriculum me
eting of the Associate Deans Academic Council.  If applicable, adequate 
library resources and support ser
vice
s should be confirmed.

Articulation Agreements
 
 
A.
 
The decision
 
to participate in an articulation agreement with another institution(s) rests with the 
faculty.  
 
 
B.
 
For those articulation agreements that are initiated by the New Mexico Higher Education 
Department, the administration will appoint a representative to the 
HED Statewide Articulation 
Task Force.  The representative will consult closely with faculty in individual departments on 
discipline
-
specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements.  Department 
faculty must approve any changes wh
ich affect how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to 
implementation.  Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in 
the Course Transfer Matrix established by the 
Office of the 
Registrar.  (
See
 
Transfer Credit in 
Undergraduate Catalog
)  
 
 
C.
 
In cases where a change in the current HED Articulation Agreement will affect the 

 
general education requirements, the representative will consult closely with the General Edu
cation 
Committee prior to signing any articulation agreements.  The General Education Committee must 
approve any changes affecting the structure of the 

 
general education curriculum prior 
to its implementation.  
 
 
D.
 
For those articulation agreeme
nts initiated by a 
university
 
department or college, the initiating 
department or college will consult closely with the faculty in individual departments on discipline
-
specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements.  Department 
faculty 
must approve any changes in how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to implementation.  
Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in the Course 
Transfer Matrix established by the Office of the Registrar.
  
(
See
 
Transfer Credit in Undergraduate 
Catalog
)
 
 
E.
 
The 
Board of Regents
 
endorses the concept of articulation between 2 and 4
-
year colleges and 
universities.  At the 
university,
 

ranscripts has been done by 
one central office for over 15 years.  By centrally evaluating these transcripts, the majority of the 
problems with respect to articulation have been resolved.  In addition, the 
university
 
has prepared 
academic transfer guides f
or all two
-
year institutions in the state of New Mexico.  To promote the 
continuous efficient, forward progress of students through the educational system of New Mexico, 
the 
board
 
endorses practices and matrices which facilitate the intrastate transfer of 
credit and 
support the development and implementation of a statewide articulation plan.  To this end, 
students awarded the Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree from an accredited New 
Mexico postsecondary institution will be accepted at the juni
or level*
 
in baccalaureate degree
-
granting institutions.

A credit equals 1 hour of class per week during a semester.  To convert laboratory clock hours to credit hours, divide 
 
the laboratory clock hours by 2.  Thus a course designated as (2+2P)
 
could be evaluated as 3 credits.  (See

Curricula Changes
 
 
A.
 
All new courses, course changes (descript
ion, credit, prerequisite, etc.), and course deletions are 
approved by the Associate Deans Academic Council, prior to being placed in the catalog or in the 
Schedule of Classes.  This includes courses offered at the community colleges that meet for less 
tha
n a full semester.  A special meeting is called when appropriate to consider interim courses and 
other course changes approved for review by the chair of the Associate Deans Academic Council.  
Deadlines for having this information to appropriate offices wi
ll be announced and enforced.  The 
chair is empowered to act for the committee on a one
-
time
-
only basis in the case of extenuating 
circumstanc
es.
 
 
B.
 
Although a grade of D is "passing" but "below
-
average" work, it is recognized that in some 
courses
,
 
and seque
nces of courses highly cumulative in nature, below
-
average work is not 
adequate preparation for the subsequent courses.  In such cases the Associate Deans Academic 
Council may approve a prerequisite specifying "a grade of C or better in the prerequisite co
urse."
 
 
C.
 
A 
department wishing to initiate a new course, delete a present course, or introduce changes in 
descriptions, credits, or prerequisites must submit the request to the cognizant dean on the NCR 
form designed for this purpose.  (These forms, commonly
 
called "flimsies," are available in the 
deans' offices.)  Format guidelines for flimsies are also available in the deans' offices.
 
 
D.
 
Summary sheets, in alpha
-
numeric order by prefix, provide a cover list of changes.  (For example, 
a number change  BIOL 116
 
to BIOL 119; a title change  CHEM 199, Intro. to CHEM to 
Elementary Chem; a credit hour change  PE101, 1 cr to 2 cr; a  prereq. Change E T 101 to E T 
112; a course deletion GEOG 206; or a new course.)  Copies of summary sheets and flimsies are 
distributed
 
by each dean as follows:

Objections to any change cited on a flimsy are resolved prior to the meeting of the Associate 
Deans 
 
Academic Council.  If this is not possible, a written statement must be submitted to the 
committee chair p
rior to the day of the meeting.  Automatic approval of the committee will be 
extended to all 
 
courses for which there are no written objections.  Any dispute regarding a 
flimsy that cannot be resolved by the Associate Academic Deans Council will be referre
d to the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
for a final decision.  
 
 
F.
 
The recommendations of the Associate Deans Academic Council are reported immediately to the 
departments by the deans.  An approved copy of the NCR form is distributed to the scheduling 
office, cognizant dean, and the cognizant department head.  Courses which have not been offered 
for 
5
 
years are subject to automatic deletion by the scheduling office.  Before initiating deletion, 
the scheduling director prepares a list of such courses, an
d departments may request that they be 
maintained if suitable justification exists.
 
 
6.40
 
 
Course Material/Textbooks
 
 
A.
 
Course Material
:  Department heads are responsible for having on file a course outline for each 
course offered by the department.  Each
 
professor is responsible for course content and selection 
of required materials (textbook(s), supplementary printed material, equipment, supplies) for the 
course.  The professor is obligated to keep course costs to the student as low as possible.  The 
dep
artment head is responsible for the approval of bookstore requests, requests for supplementary 
materials, and for the coordination of requirements for multiple sections.  The department head 
should be cognizant of course costs to students and advise the pr
ofessors should such costs appear 
to be excessive.  
 
 
B.
 
Textbooks
:  All textbook orders from faculty must be channeled through the department head for 
signature and approval and then forwarded to the bookstore manager.  The bookstore manager will 
review d
epartmental requests for textbooks and order as per the department head's request.  Order 
quantities may be increased or decreased by the bookstore manager if previous enrollment or sales 
history indicates that it is necessary.  Department heads must notif
y the bookstore manager 
immediately when additional sections are opened or courses canceled.  Faculty will not be allowed 
to order and/or sell books on or off campus without written approval from the appropriate dean 
and the bookstore manager.  Before a fa
culty member may require students to buy a textbook or 
other material authored or coauthored by that faculty member, approval from the department head 
is required.  The department head may convene a committee of department faculty to consider the 
matter.  
If the department head is the author/coauthor of the required textbook or other material, a 
committee
 
of department faculty will consider the matter and make a recommendation to the dean, 
whose approval will be required.  Supplementary materials, published
 
or unpublished, produced 
by departments or individuals for sale to students will be sold through the 
university
 
Bookstore or 
through 
 
other vendors who are authorized to purchase such materials from departments only, not 
from individual faculty members.  
Payment by the vendors shall be made to the department upon 
receipt of an appropriate departmental voucher or invoice.  Faculty and staff members may request 
reimbursement from their departments for their expenses.

:  
Colleges or departments may propose new course prefixes 
through appropriate channels to the 
executive
 
vice

A.
 
Allegations Reported To Dean
:
  
Allegations regarding academic misconduct which may result in 
permanent expulsion or degree revocation shall be brought 
immediately to the attention of the 
appropriate dean.
 
 
B.
 
Preliminary Investigation
:  
The dean shall conduct a preliminary investigation with an appropriate 
professional body within the 
university.
 
 
1.
 
The dean may consult experts in the professional field in wh
ich misconduct is suspected.  The 
purpose of this consultation shall be to provide an evaluation of the alleged misconduct.
 
 
2.
 
In all cases where such serious academic misconduct is suspected, the dean shall convene a 
misconduct review panel consisting of th
e department head of the appropriate department, or 
if appropriate, Graduate Council chair, the chair of the Faculty Senate, and an administrative 
officer of the unit in which the suspected misconduct occurred.  No one who has participated 
in any previous 
decisions relating to the facts underlying the allegations in question may 
participate on the Review Panel (or on the ad hoc committee, described below).  In the event 
of a conflict of interest, alleged bias against the accused or refusal to serve on the p
anel, the 
dean shall appoint a replacement from the senior faculty.  This panel shall review the 
evidence and its evaluation, decide whether a formal charge is appropriate, and advise the 
dean and the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.
 
 
3.
 
If, after such p
reliminary investigation, serious academic misconduct which could result in 
degree revocation is suspected, the dean shall notify the executive vice president and provost.
 
 
C.
 
Formal Charges
:
  
If so advised, the dean shall:
 
 
1.
 
I
ssue in writing a formal charge, 
detailing the basis for the charge, to be delivered to the 
accused as described below.
 
 
2.
 
N
otify the accused in writing of the formal charge(s), including the factual allegations, in 
detail, upon which such charge(s) are based.  This notice will also inform 
the accused of the 
right to appear at a hearing before an ad hoc committee and to present evidence at that 
hearing.  The notice shall inform the accused of the proposed date of the hearing and that, if 
the allegations are substantiated, the revocation of t
he accused's degree will be considered as a 
sanction.  In addition, a copy of these procedures shall be included with the notice.  This 
notice shall be delivered to the accused in person or by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested.

Distinction from Honorary Doctoral Degrees:  
These initiatives are separate from the 
established practice of aw
arding an honorary doctoral degree at each commencement and are 
intended to expand public recognition opportunities where it is deemed appropriate and 
conducive to enhance public relations for the 
university.
 
 
G.
 
Honorary Doctoral Degrees
:  Selection of ho
norary doctoral degree recipients rests with the 
Board 
of Regents
. The responsibility for seeking qualified nominees for the honorary doctorate degree 
rests with the Office of 
U
niversity
 
Advancement.  Nominations will be sought from the campus 
community, a
lumni, and volunteers.  No current faculty member or administrator of the 
university,
 
nor any currently serving elected official, should receive honorary degrees; however, with a 
unanimous vote of the 
board
, these prohibitions can be overruled. The 
vice
 
pr
esident
 
for 
university
 
advancement will screen the nominations, provide biographical information, and make 
recommendations through the 
president
 
to the 
board
.  The 
board
 
will make the final selection.  The 
honorary doctoral degree is normally presented dur
ing commencement ceremonies.

Independent Studies
 
 
Independent studies are for students capable of 
self
-
direction,
 
who 
meets
 
the requirement for the S/U 
option, 
i.e
., if the students are not eligible for the S/U option, they are not eligible for in
dependent 
study.  Class tickets will not be issued, nor will on
-
line scheduling unless the student presents a signed 
Independent Study Permit to the card issuer.  Independent study courses are considered part of a 
faculty member's load. Departments will es
tablish standards for each independent study course offered.  
The instructor should file a summary of requirements with the department head for each student 
enrolled in an independent study course before the last day to add or drop a course.  Independent s
tudy 
research or reading courses may not be challenged.
 
 
6.82
 
 
 
Majors and Minors
 
 
A.
 
Majors
:  New majors, including those of associate degrees, are endorsed by the Academic Deans 
Council, 
and then
 
approved by the Faculty Senate and the 
Board of Regents
.  
A major is defined 
as a recognized area of study in which there is an extensive and well
-
developed curriculum offered 
at the 
university,
 
as well as adequate library resources and support ser
vice
s.  A major may include 
courses from more than one department,
 
but as a minimum it must consist of at least 24 credits in 
the major field, of which 18 credits must be upper
-
division courses.  A student may take a double 
major.  In this case, 
the student
 
must meet all of the requirements in the catalog for each degree
.  
Courses taken outside of the two major fields may be used to fulfill the conditions of both degrees.
 
 
B.
 
S
upplementary Majors
:  In addition to a major, a student may elect to undertake a supplementary 
major.  The academic colleges offer supplementary ma
jors in areas where sufficient numbers of 
courses of a closely
-
related nature are available so as to constitute a significant body of study.  The 
minimum requirements for a supplementary major are 24 credits taken from the catalog listing for 
the field of 
study, of which 18 credits must be upper
-
division courses.
 
 
C.
 
Minors
:  A student may also minor in a particular area.  A minor is based on courses that 
encompass a recognized field of study.  As a minimum, a minor must consist of 18 credits of 
course work
, of which 9 credits are at the upper
-
division level.  Upon approval of the dean of the 

 
NMSU Policy Manual

college, departments may offer a minor that meets these requirements by describing it and 
receiving approval from the dean of the college.  Departments may require that
 
certain courses be 
a part of a minor and may exclude other courses.  Acceptable minors are those listed in the catalog 
for a department.  If a particular minor is not offered by a department, a student may petition for 
the recognition of that minor at the
 
time of filing for a degree.  If the department and the college 
concerned approve, they will notify the student and the registrar to that effect.  Succeeding 
catalogs will then list that department as offering the particular minor and the requirements tha
t 
must be met.

Summer Session
 
(
See
 
also
 
Policy 5.25.40, Compensation
-
Summer
)
 
 
 
Summer teaching at the 
university
 
is considered a privilege and not a right.  Departments will use the 
 
following guidelines in determining summer teaching assignments within the department's FTE 
 
summer allocation:
 
 
A.
 
 
Priorities
:  1) 
The first priorit
y must be student and program needs
. 
 
As resources permit, courses 
needed by the students to complete programs in a timely fashion should be offered
.  2) 
After 
student needs, continuing tenured and tenure
-
track faculty will have priority in teaching 
assign
ments.
 
 
B.
 
 
Development of Departmental Policy
:  
Departments will have the flexibility to develop their own 
policies after priorities #1 and #2 above have been met.  The departmental policy must be written 
and available to all departmental faculty and other i
nterested parties.
  
 
The departmental policy 
must adhere to existing policies related to summer teaching (
e.g
., current policy states that, in 
general, faculty members will be employed in one 6
-
week period only).
 
 
C
.
 
Allocation as Relates to Department Hea
ds
:  
No summer session faculty allocation is used for 12
-
month department heads who teach in the summe
r
.
 
 
D
.
 
Schedule
: Two 6
-
week sessions will be scheduled between the end of the spring semester and the 
beginning of the fall semester.  Colleges and depart
ments offering courses numbered 450 and 
above, designed primarily to meet the needs of teachers have permanent approval to offer courses 
on a 5
-
week schedule.  During the first summer session, the 5
-
week option schedule begins after 
the first week of instr
uction.  In the second summer session, the 5
-
week option schedule ends after 
the fifth week of instruction.  It is recognized that students may be registered in both 5
-
week and 
6
-
week courses.  Graduate students in a combined registration may not register 
for more than 6 
credits. 
 
 
E
.
 
Faculty Teaching
-
Normal
:  Because the summer schedule must be prepared well in advance, and 
summer funding is always uncertain, early agreements regarding summer teaching must be 
identified as tentative.  
No actual commitment 
is made until approvals are completed on an 
E
-
Hire
 
Form Permission to Offer section).  Full load for 6 weeks is 4.5 semester credits or equivalent.  
(For community college faculty the full load for 6 weeks is 6 semester credits or equivalent.)

may be continued in certain circumstances.  Refer to the COBRA section of the medical plan 
Benefit Booklet for details.
 
 
G.
 
Coverage After Retirement
:  An employee who offi
cially retires from the 
university
 
and receives a 
monthly benefit from the Educational Retirement 
B
oard
 
immediately upon termination of 
employment (those eligible under the Alternative Retirement Plan must meet the regular 
Educational Retirement 
B
oard
 
elig
ibility rules and immediately begin receiving a benefit) may 
elect to continue medical insurance after retirement, providing the employee had been covered 
under the plan for the prior 10 consecutive years and worked in a regular employment status.  
Time wh
ile enrolled as an employee or as a spouse of an active employee will be counted toward 
the 10 years.  Coverage as the spouse of a retiree will not be credited toward the 10 years.  The 
university
 
continues to pay a percentage of the premium.  When a retir
ee or dependent becomes 
age 65 and/or eligible for Medicare, all medical coverage will be moved to the Medicare Carve
-
Out Plan.  If the retiree or dependent enrolls in Medicare Part D, they will no longer be eligible 
access prescription coverage through th
e medical plan.  The 
university
 
reserves the right to 
unilaterally increase, decrease or discontinue coverages, plan provisions, and premiums.  
 
 
H.
 
Dependent Coverage after Retirement
: Spouses of eligible retirees covered at the time of 
retirement may contin
ue coverage after retirement.  Only dependent children covered at the time 
of retirement may continue coverage after retirement.  New spouses of retirees acquired after 
retirement may be added to the plan under certain circumstances.  In order to add a new
 
spouse, an 
enrollment form must be completed.  The new spouse may not be added until 1 year after the date 
of receipt of the form by the 
Office of Human Resource Services
,
 
the retiree must still be living 
and have medical insurance coverage at the end of 
the 1 year waiting period.  New spouse 
coverage begins the first day of the month following the 1 year waiting period.  There will be no 
university
 
contributions to the new premium, and the retiree will be responsible for paying 100 
percent of the premium 
for the new spouse's coverage.  The new spouse will be eligible for 
surviving spouse benefits. If a retiree passes away during the new spouse's 1
-
year waiting period, 
the new spouse will not be eligible for surviving spouse benefits.   New dependent childr
en 
acquired after retirement may not be added to the plan.  A retiree who rescinds retirement, returns 
to full
-
time employment, and later retires, may only continue coverage for dependent children who 
have been covered as a dependent for at least 10 years.
 
Time covered under the retiree as an active 
employee will count toward the 10 years. If coverage is discontinued by the retiree for self or any 
covered dependent (including spouse), retiree and/or dependent may never re
-
enroll.  Surviving 
spouse of a dece
ased retiree may continue coverage until re
-
marriage if they receive a monthly 
benefit from the ERB and pay 100 percent of the premium.  Surviving dependent children of a 
deceased retiree may continue coverage until they no longer meet the rule of a depend
ent child 
under the medical plan by paying 100 percent of the premium.  If coverage is terminated or 
dependents are removed from the plan for any reason, enrollment in the plan at a later date is 
prohibited.

Other Considerations Relating to Military Leave
:

Employees are not entitled to use military leave if the
y are mobilized or volunteer for active 
duty.  
 
 
3.
 
Military leave may only be used for training purposes.  
 
 
4.
 
Employees may continue insurances during the leave
-
without
-
pay period by paying 100 
percent of the total premiums (both employee and employer shares)
.  Any employee called to 
active duty who discontinues insurance coverages during the leave

without
-
pay period may be 
placed immediately back on the plans upon return to employment without providing evidence 
of insurability.  
 
 
5.
 
Injuries/illnesses sustained
 
during the active duty period will not be covered by the 
university
 
health plan.  These conditions would be covered by the Veterans Administration.  
 
 
6.
 
An attorney general's opinion, rendered after the passage of this law, points out that it does 
not perta
in to temporary employees.

Dates for such leave must have prior administrative approval within the department and 
retained with internal leave records.

A.
 
Eligibi
lity
:  
After 3 years of ser
vice
 
and with the approval of appropriate department head and 
administrators, any regular full

time 
exempt
 
staff member or any faculty member of regular 
appointment with rank of instructor or above may submit an application for p
rofessional leave 
without pay, normally not to exceed 1 year, for the purpose of undertaking some project that will 
directly benefit the 
university
 
and the person's professional development. These benefits must be 
detailed in the application. 
 
 
B.
 
Use of Accr
ued Annual Leave
:  
If the leave without pay is approved, all annual leave should be 
used before the professional leave without pay begins.  
 
 
C.
 
Non

All days, including legal holidays, in the period between 
the date the professional leave commences and the date the employee returns to work are taken 
without pay. 
 
 
E.
 
Insurance Premiu
ms Contribution by NMSU
:  
The

will contribute the employer's 
portion of insurance premiums during the leave period.  
 
 
F.
 
Performance Evaluation
:  
In cases where the individual enters a contract with a state or federal 
agency, such agreements must 
provide for a calendar

Sabbatical
 
 
A.
 
Purpose
:  The purpose of a sabbatical leave is to promote pro
fessional growth and increased 
competence among faculty members by subsidizing significant study and research, creative work, 
or some other program which is judged to be of equivalent value and which cannot be 
accomplished during the fulfillment of normal 
academic duties and responsibilities.  All 
departments and colleges including 
community colleges
 
are encouraged to participate fully in the 
sabbatical program.
 
 
B.
 
Qualifications and Options
:  Application for sabbatical leave may be made by any tenured ful
l
-
time faculty member (above the rank of instructor) with at least 12 regular semesters of full
-
time 
ser
vice
 
at the 
university
 
without a sabbatical.  A faculty member who is in the last year of the 
probationary period may be considered for sabbatical leave
 
if a favorable decision on tenure has 
already been made.   Sabbatical leave may be taken in conjunction with earned annual leave, 
personal leave, or educational leave without pay.  Personal leave and educational leave without 
pay must comply with 
universi
ty
 
policies. In instances where, for good and sufficient institutional 
reasons, a sabbatical leave is delayed (not to exceed 2 years), the faculty member will become 
eligible for a succeeding sabbatical leave after an equivalently reduced period.  A facult
y member 
should be given as much notice as possible if a sabbatical leave cannot be approved for the time 
frame requested. Sabbatical leave is available under the following options: 
 
 
1.
 
One semester at no reduction in annual salary.
 
 
2.
 
One full cont
ract year a
t 60 percent salary 
(Those within 5 years of retirement should consult 
the Employee Benefits Office about the possible negative impact on the retirement benefit 
formula.)
 
 
3.
 
Semester II (spring) of 1 year and Semester I (fall) of the following year, at 30 pe
rcent annual 
salary for each semester of leave.
 
 
 
When a person has served as both a 9
-
month and 12
-
month employee in the 6
-
year period 
immediately prior to the requested sabbatical, the amount of time allotted for the sabbatical will be 
prorated.  A facul
ty member employed on a continuing basis on a 12
-
month contract may take a 6
-
month leave at full salary or a 12
-
month leave at 60 percent salary.
 
 
C.
 
Applications
:  Sabbatical leave will not be granted automatically upon the expiration of the 
necessary per
iod of ser
vice
.  Rather, a qualified faculty member shall, normally at least 6 months 
in advance of the leave, submit an application and proposed leave program to the department head 
or chair, with evidence of research, creative activity, or other academic
 
achievement, including 
publications, to support the program of work which is planned for the sabbatical period.  Also, this 
program shall give reasonable promise of accomplishing the major purpose of the leave.  Request 
for a sabbatical leave should be ac
companied by a detailed explanation of the benefits to the 
faculty member, 
university,
 
and the state resulting from the sabbatical leave.  For main campus 
faculty, the approval of the cognizant dean, graduate dean and 
provost
 
are required.  For 
community c
olleges
, the approval of the division dean, CAO and CEO are required.  In addition to 
the work plan, the leave application should include:  (1) a statement regarding choice of options; 
(2) departmental verification that during the applicant's absence, teac
hing, research, and ser
vice
 
duties can be managed by the department; (3) a statement concerning compensation to be received 
during the leave.  A faculty member on sabbatical leave at full pay usually will not take other paid 
employment during the leave; an
d (4) a clear statement of the benefit of the proposed leave to the 
university.
  
A person on sabbatical at 60 percent time usually will not take more than 40 percent 
time employment.  However, it is recognized that such employment may be necessary for or 
e
nhance the leave.  In such cases, a request to take compensated employment should be included 
in the proposal submitted and must have administrative approval. The evaluation of an application 
should be based on whether the planned program satisfies the aim
s and goals explicitly set forth in 
the Purpose statement above.  These aims and goals may be independent of geographical location 
of the leave activities and, therefore, the place of the faculty member's residence during leave 
should be only one factor in
 
considering the merits of the application.   However, to ensure that

the sabbatical experience provides opportunities not otherwise available to the main campus 
faculty member, the sabbatical period will normally include a component of study/work away 
fro
m the home institution.  
 
 
D.
 
Related Conditions
:  Time toward each new sabbatical begins immediately after return to full
-
time 
ser
vice
 
regardless of the semester of return.  The sabbatical leave will not adversely affect salary 
increases or promotions.  I
nstitutional participation in faculty retirement and group insurance will 
be continued for staff on sabbatical leave with pay.  A faculty member on sabbatical leave may 
request, through the department head, travel support for participation in professional 
meetings.  
Consideration will be given if the faculty member is an officer of the professional organization or 
is to participate in some other significant way.  Educational or other leaves are excluded as time 
counted toward eligibility for sabbatical leav
e. Twelve
-
month faculty will accrue annual and sick 
leave (at 60 percent for those on 60 percent pay) and will report annual and sick leave as usual. 
 
 
E.
 
Departmental Implementation
:  Long
-
range department plans should consider the necessity of, and 
provi
de for, temporary absences for sabbatical leave.  The initial leave discussions and 
concomitant management of duties is primarily a matter for discussion and approval by the 
concerned department.  However, in transmitting the final leave request to the dea
n and 
provost
, 
the department head should provide assurance that all student needs will be served by the 
department during the faculty member's absence.  In some departments, the absence of one faculty 
member might place an undue load on the other departme
nt members.  After a department has 
taken every step possible to plan for sabbatical leaves, it should submit its proposal to the dean for 
consideration.  The administration will attempt to accommodate these special cases.  
 
 
F.
 
Procedures
:
 
 
1.
 
At least 6 mon
ths prior to the requested leave period (exceptions to be considered on a case
-
by
-
case basis), application for sabbatical leave is submitted to the department head on a 
Request for Leave Form and includes the supporting materials detailed in the Applicatio
n 
section.
 
 
2.
 
Preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department head, cognizant dean, 
dean of the
 
Graduate School, and the 
provost
 
are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. 
 
For 
community college 
faculty, preliminary approval is obtained wh
en signatures of the 
department chair, division dean, CAO and CEO are affixed to the Request for Leave Form.  A 
supplementary
 
contract, stipulating that the faculty member is obligated and agrees to return 
to the 
university
 
to
 
serve a period of 1 year, and
 
failure to do so would require immediate full 
refund of all salary paid by the 
university
 
during the leave, is prepared and sent to the facult
y 
member.  Upon receipt of the s
igned supplementary contract, final approval of the leave is 
granted and the facu
lty member is
 
notified.
 
 
3.
 
Department heads or chairs submit a Personnel Action Form to place the faculty member on
 
sabbatical.
 
 
G.
 
Post
 
S
abbatical Obligations
:  Sabbatical leaves will be approved only with the clear understanding 
that at the completion of t
he sabbatical and/or supplemental leave, the faculty member will return 
to the 
university
 
for a period of ser
vice
 
of 1 year.  Failure to do so will require immediate full 
refund of all salaries and benefits costs paid by the 
university
 
during the sabbatica
l, and repayment 
for any annual leave accrued and used during the extended leave.  Within the first semester upon 
return from the sabbatical, the main campus faculty member shall submit to the 
provost
, through 
the department head and dean a full report of 
the research, creative work, publications, or other 
results of the period of leave.  This final report should contain a brief summary of the proposal, 
including a review of the objectives, as well as a summary of what was accomplished.  An 
explanation shou
ld be given in the event that some objective(s) were not met.  This report will be 
incorporated in the faculty member

s annual written report and may be used in the annual 
performance evaluation process.  The dean will forward the report
 
with both the dean

department 
heads
 
comments 
to the 
provost
 
regarding the overall value of the sabbatical to the 
faculty member and to the 
university
 
and indicating the extent to which the sabbatical plan was 
accomplished.  
Community college 
faculty will submit a simi
lar report to the CEO through their 
immediate supervisor.

6.
 
A department may require supporting documentation for any usage of sick leave any time 
abuse of sick leave is suspected.  
Any grant of sick leave in excess of 3 consecutive working 
days should b
e supported by a medical certificate or other evidence administratively 
acceptable.  Abuse of sick leave may be grounds for immediate dismissal.

month pay base to an academic 
faculty pay base will be paid for earned sick leave over 600 hours (not to exceed 200 hours).  
Th
e payment will be made at a rate of 50 percent of the employee's straight
-
time hourly salary 
multiplied by the number of sick leave hours accrued over 600 to a maximum of 200.  The 
payment may not exceed 50 percent x hourly rate x 200.  (According to Educa

Sick leave will be transferred from one department to another with the employee.  
 
 
10.
 
Sick leave may be used when 
the employee's presence is reasonably required for the care of 
dependents during illness or recovery from injury.  For this purpose, dependents are defined 
as spouse, children, or immediate family members any of whom normally reside in an 
employee's househ
old and who are dependent upon the employee for support and 
maintenance.  A physician's statement may be required to support the usage of sick leave for 
dependents.  Sick leave may be granted to a full
-
time employee for the purpose of caring for a 
newly ad
opted well child under the age of 5 years.  Exceptions may be considered for children 
ages 5 and older upon request to the human resource ser
vice
 
director.  The leave may be given 
upon request and approval commencing with formal adoption or receipt of plac
ement papers.  
Leave time may not exceed 6 weeks.  If both adoptive parents are employed by the 
university,
 
combined leave time may not exceed 6 weeks.  Birth fathers and mothers may use up to 6 
weeks of sick leave within the first 12 weeks immediately fol
lowing the birth of a child.  Birth 
mothers may use more than 6 weeks of sick leave for time that is required to be off work due 
to complications arising from the birth of the child that is directly associated with the 

of a newborn child with a serious health condition will 
be administered under the sick leave policy associated with caring for a dependent.

Sick Leave Bank
 
 
A.
 
This program establishes a Sick Leave Bank to be used by 
participating 
university
 
employees 
affected by a personal emergency, and who have insufficient leave to cover required work 
absences.  
 
 
B.
 
A personal emergency is defined as an unusual and catastrophic medical or immediate family 
medical emergency that is li
kely to require an employee's absence from duty for a prolonged 
period of time and to result in a substantial loss of income because of the unavailability of paid 
leave.  
 
 
C.
 
Only those items allowable under the 
university
 
Sick Leave Policy are covered by th
e Sick Leave 
Bank; maternity leave in connection with an uncomplicated pregnancy is not a personal 
emergency.  
 
 
D.
 
The bank allows employees to share the risk of severe circumstances by donating to a common 
pool of leave.  
 
 
E.
 
Members of the pool are required 
to enroll in the long
-
term disability insurance long
-
term 
disability program as a protection against income loss while recovering from a severe medical 
condition.  The long
-
term disability policy covers total disability after a waiting period of 135 
consec
utive calendar days or 100 work days.  
 
 
F.
 
The maximum a recipient can receive from the Sick Leave Bank is 70 days per personal 
emergency with no more than one withdrawal from the bank per fiscal year or per personal 
emergency.  No more than 70 days can be w
ithdrawn for a particular medical condition.  
 
 
G.
 
Employees would be wise to maintain a balance of at least 30 days of combined sick and annual 
leave to cover them during the first 30 days of personal emergency or total disability.  The Sick 
Leave Bank does 
not provide for the first 30 days of the personal emergency; these are the 
responsibility of the employee and are covered by the employee's sick and annual leave or leave 
without pay.

s to 
be distributed to. Employees may elect participation in the tax sheltered annuity plans at any time 
during the year. Contributions end when an employee terminates employment, retires, completes a

Area/Shift Differentials
 
 
A.
 
Shift
 
Differential
 
Pay (Nonexempt)
:  Work schedules are divided into three, 8
-
hour shifts in 
any 24

h
our work day.  
Normally, the daytime shift receives the base rate of pay; the second 
shift (swing) receives a $.10 per hour pay differential; the third shift (graveyard) receives a 
$.40 per hour pay differential.  Any granting of differentials other than t
hose specified must 
have specific
 
approval of the 
Office of 
Human Resource Ser
vice
s
.  Payment is reported on 
Form 302 for employees rotating shifts.  A Personnel Action Form is used for non
-
rotating 
shift employees.  The comment section of the Personnel Ac
tion Form should note the base 
salary and shift differential separately.   In order to be eligible for a shift differential, an 
employee

s normal work schedule must extend more than 3 hours into the swing or 
graveyard shift.  An employee is eligible for sh
ift differential pay only for those hours 
extending into the swing or graveyard shift.  
 
 
B.
 
Area Differential Pay
:  Occasionally, employees are sent on temporary duty to locations 
outside their normal work area.  When the cost of temporary lodging and foo
d exceeds the 
normal per diem rate, the supervisor may request a temporary adjustment to the employee's 
base pay during the absence to compensate for this loss.  Such requests should be 
submitted 
to the 
Office of 
Human Resource Ser
vice
s
.  Adjustments in th
e in
-
hire rate for 
nonexempt
 
employees to a rate above the entry rate to compensate for areas or positions in which the 

 
entry level salary is not competitive may be considered by the 
Office of

development program that will provide an opportunity for the individual to become qualified 
for a position. Normally, the salary schedule for the trainee will not be less than 80 percent 
of the minimum non
-
probati
onary salary for the position and will provide for periodic 
incremental increases.

the local market. (
See
 
Area Differential

nonexem
pt positions are based on the grade as set by the current salary schedule 
and the 
university
 
job classification specification.  No employee shall be paid less 
than the minimum for his or her grade in the salary schedule. Classification 
specifications are s
tandardized descriptions of the characteristics, duties, and 
minimum qualifications for a group of positions. The qualifications statement in 
each classification specification establishes minimum requirements that are to be 
met by an individual before bein
g considered for appointment or promotion.  
Combinations of education and experience are specified in the classification 
specification.  Other combinations, if deemed equivalent by the 
Office of Human 
Resource Services
, may qualify an individual for appoin
tment or promotion.  
Employees may be required by their supervisor to perform duties outside the 
general skill level of their classification specification on a temporary basis.  A 
supervisor who determines that the standard classification specification doe
s not 
accurately describe a position should initiate reclassification action (
See

awarded the app
ropriate base adjustment.  Temporary employees are paid on an 
hourly basis.  The 
E

:  
Hardship differential p

employees assigned to work f
or a fixed period of time on a specific project to meet an 
objective, and under extraordinary working conditions.

B.
 
Procedural Guidance
:  
 
 
1.
 
Management should attempt to schedule staff and faculty such that excessive 
overtime and hardship to the employee 
is avoided; the hardship differential pay 
addresses those situations where this cannot be avoided.  
 
 
2.
 
Extraordinary working conditions include situations when the employee is required 
to work an inordinate number of hours beyond the normal forty (40) hour 
work 
week, or to work under unusually risky and/or hazardous conditions, or to work 
away from home through a holiday.  Such working conditions should not be the 
norm, and payment of extra compensation is justified due to the significant hardship 
placed on 
the employee during the period of time necessary to meet the work 
objective.  
 
 
3.
 
In order to receive hardship differential pay, the appropriate dean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
designee and the 
Office of Human Resource Services
 
must approve it in writing. 
 
 
4.
 
The amou
nt of the hardship differential pay will be a differential over and above the 

 
 
a.
 
Hardship differential pay will be included in the calculation of overtime 
compensation for 
non
exempt empl
oyees. 
 
b.
 
The differential for exempt and faculty employees shall not exceed their 
regular base rate of pay.

[
Amendment

Board of Regents

A.
 
Employees Exempt from Overtime
:  Any individual employed in a bona fide 
executive
, 
administrative, or 
exempt 
capacity, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, may be 
exempted from compensatory time o
r payment of overtime.  Employees so exempted 
shall be termed exempt.  All other categories will be termed nonexempt.  
Exempt/nonexempt status will be determined by a review of the specific description of 
duties for the position in question.  Positions hav
ing like classifications may receive 
different exempt/nonexempt classifications based on the specific duties and 
responsibilities required.  The 
Office of Human Resource Services
 
may be contacted for 
information regarding exempt/nonexempt status on any pos
ition.
 
 
B.
 
Overtime Administration
:  A director/department head may prescribe reasonable periods 
of overtime work to meet the needs of an operation.  A nonexempt employee may only 
work more than 40 hours a week after having obtained prior approval or instr
uctions 
from the appropriate supervisor.  Complete records of overtime for employees will be 
maintained in each department or office.
 
 
C.
 
Overtime Payment
:  Nonexempt employees as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(
See 
Chapter 4 Human Resources 
-
 
General 
-
 
Hiring Definitions
)
 
are eligible to be 
compensated or given compensatory time for overtime.  
Upon election by the employee, 
overtime work may be compensated in the form of overtime pay or compensatory time 
off.
  
Normally, employees who are eligible for payment of overtime will not work in 
excess of a 40
-
hour week.  To prevent a backlog, workloads should be adjusted by 
determining needs sufficiently in advance so that temporary help may be hired.  
The 
university
 
has no contractual obligation to pay overtime or approve compensatory time.
  
If it becomes necessary for nonexempt employees to work more than 40 hours in a 
week, the following will apply:
 
 

NMSU Policy Manual 
                                     
                                  
        
                                      
                    
Chapter 8 
Page

1.
 
All regular, non
-
exempt, employees shall be paid for all hours wor
ked in excess of 

additional 0.5 times for the overtime hours worked or be paid for all hours worked 

of pay and 
earn comp time at an additional 0.5 times the overtime hours worked.
 
 
2.
 
When 
regular, 
part
-
time, employees are required
 
to work more than their normal 
scheduled hours, but less than 40 hours per week, they will be paid for additional 
hours (at str
aight time
 
rates) up to a total of 40 hours in a work week.  All time 
worked in excess of 40 hours is subject to the
 
provisions in #1 above.
 
 
3.
 
When temporary employees are required to work more than their normal scheduled 
hours, but less than 40 hours per w
eek, they will be paid for additional hours (at 
straight time rates) up to a total of 40 hours in a work week. All time worked in 

0.5 times the overtime hours worked.
 
 
C.
 
Holi
day Pay
:  Any nonexempt employee required to work on one of the official holidays 
and who does not receive a day off in lieu of the holiday, may be compensated at one 
and a half times the regular hourly rate in addition to the holiday pay regardless of the
 
number of hours actually worked during the normal work week.  If compensatory time, 
in lieu of payment, is granted for work performed on a holiday, it shall be granted at the 
rate of one and one half times the number of hours worked regardless of the numb
er of 
hours actually worked during the normal work week.  An employee whose normal work 
schedule does not include a day designated as an official 
university
 
holiday may receive 
a day off in lieu of the holiday during the same work week in which the holiday
 
falls.  
Payment for a holiday, annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, compensatory 
time, or compassionate leave will be considered as hours worked only during a work 
week in which an official 
university
 
holiday occurs.  Otherwise, in order to be 
paid at 
the overtime rate, actual hours worked must be in excess of 40 hours for an employee's 
work week.  If holiday hours and actual hours worked exceed 40 hours in a workweek, 
calculation of overtime hours will exclude holiday premium hours already comp
ensated.
 
 
D.
 
Overtime Reporting
:  Nonexempt employees eligible for payment of overtime who are 
required to work in excess of 40 hours per week will report overtime hours worked on 
the 
university
 
Compensation Overtime Report at the end of the pay period.  The 
method 
for computing overtime is stated on the form. 
 
 
E.
 
Compensatory Time
 
(Comp Time)
: The purpose of compensatory time is to provide an 
alternative to cash payment of overtime.  A nonexempt employee may only work more 
than 40 hours a week after having obta
ined prior approval or instructions from the 
appropriate supervisor.  
 
 
1.
 
Upon election by the employee, overtime work may be compensated in the form of 
compensatory time off. When such form of compensation is elected, the employee 
shall be paid for all hour
s worked in excess of forty (40) hours during the work 

and earn comp time at an additional .5 times the overtime hours worked. The 
university
 
shall designate two (2) opportuni

receive comp time for overtime hours worked, to be effective on January 1 and July 
1.
 
 
2.
 
The date to be taken as comp time off shall be scheduled by agreement between the 
supervisor and the employee. Supervisory appr
oval for the use of comp time shall 
not be unreasonably withheld. A supervisor may direct that an employee use 
accrued comp time.

A maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) hours of comp time may be accrued 
in a fiscal year. Comp time earned for overtime an
d reported by the payroll deadline 
shall be accrued at the next regularly scheduled pay day. An employee may request 
payment of accrued comp time at any time, which shall then be paid at the next 
regularly scheduled pay day. All comp time must be used or p

fiscal year or prior to transfer or termination.

look for all signage on campus. Collaboration and participation by in
terested parties 
(administrative staff, architects, sign designers, interior designers, campus project managers, 
etc) will ensure that the system remains uniform and cohesive. The design of the signage will 
incorporate the guidelines from the branding init
iative.
