To this end, intbrmation technology and university organizations shall:(1)Establish and protect the network perimeter(s) and facilitate the protection ofinternal netwoa'k zones housing and processing sensitive data in accordance withorganizational risk assessments as defined in The University of Toledo"Information Security Framework."(2) Provide secure remote access thi'ough the perimeter for authorized users. Remoteaccess users must be authenticated against the authorized access list in accordancewith the "Remote Access Security" policy.(3) Incorporate generally prescribed system hardening techniques. Organizationsshall determine which ports and services are required to suppoa't their businessprocesses and internal system interconnectivity, limit access to these access

Organizations shall coordinate with informationtechnology to identify the types of services and protocols permitted both withinthe network and that cross network boundaries. Some clear text services thatcross the network boundaries, such as file transfer protocol (FTP), provideconvenience to the user but carry significant risk to the network. Securitymeasures for services and protocols that cross network boundaries include, but arenot limited to:(a) Servers or firewalls configured specifically to protect againstvulnerabilities(b) Host-to-host management(c) Intemet protocol (IP) specification for source and destination(d) Strong authentication(e) Encryption(f) Packet filtering(g) Activity logging(h) Vii°real Private Network (VPN)(i) System and application software security fixes and patches(j) Using secured (encrypted) alternatives to clear text services andprotocols (example: the use of SSH instead oftelnet or the use of SFTPinstead of FTP.)(4) Authentication measures and procedures. Ensure that appropriate authenticationmeasures and procedures are in place for traffic that crosses universityboundaries. Authentication measures shall be consistent with the results of therisk assessment as defined in The University of Toledo "Information SecurityFramework."(a) Use protocols that do not transmit clear text, re-usable authenticationinformation across organizational boundaries.(b) Two-factor authentication may be implemented to limit access tosystems that contain data requiring more secure access or informationwhose disclosux'e would cause serious disruption or harm.(5) Control network traffic. At a minimum, the following functions shall beprovided:(a) Isolate and protect public and private World Wide Web (Web) servicesby installing in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).(b) Use DMZ security control for network traffic entering and leaving thenetwork and crossing security boundaries.(c) Establish and protect internal enclaves as required to protect sensitivedata by establishing internal security control points using technologiessuch as firewalls.
3364-65-14 Boundary security policy                                  3(d) Per the organization's risk assessment, block unwanted traffic such as:(i)(ii)(iii)Dynamic content, including unsigned Java applets or ActiveXcontrols.Multipurpose Internet Multimedia Extensions (MIME) types.Application specific commands, such as the HTTP "delete"command.(e) Route incoming and outgoing traffic to internal systems that areprotected.(f) Hide vulnerable systems and information from the Internet, such as:(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)(vi)IP addresses and local network traffic.Network topology.Internal user IDs and account properties.Configuration details for firewalls and other network securitydevices.Physical security information for important network devices suchas file servers and routers.Continuity of operations, security assessment reports and disasterrecovery plans.(6)Monitor attempted probes, attacks or intrusions. All repeated attempts from non-authorized entities to breach the boundary shall be monitored. Informationtechnology shall activate and review logs pursuant to the security audit loggingrequirements of university policy for "Security Incident Response" and report anyevidence of an attack or intrusion as specified by the organization's incidentreporting procedures.(7) Provide a common, standardized network time source. If systems do notaccommodate accepting external network times, upgrades to these systems shallbe able and configured to do so.In addition to serving as an important element in data accuracy, the timemechanisms of the various system components must be synchronized for securityreasons. Accurate, synchronized time logs are crucial for tracking a hacker'smovements through a system that the hacker has targeted.(E) Definitions(1) Access point. In this context, any point at which an entity outside the boundaryconnects to the network that contains secured assets.(2) Boundary. The perimeter where security controls are in effect to protect assets.(3) Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). A computer host or small network established as a"neutral zone" between two networks or network segments to control direct
3364-65-14 Boundary security policy                                  4access to data and other resources. The DMZ mediates communication betweenassets and creates a boundary security according to locally established securityand access control policies.(4)Encryption. The use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form inwhich there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of aconfidential process or key.(5)(7)(8)(6)File Transfer Protocol (FTP). An inherently unsecured (non-encrypted) servicethat allows computer-to-computer communication to exchange files directly,regardless of the platforms used. FTP can be accessed through either dial-upmodems or the Internet. Secured file transfer protocols such as SFTP or FTPSshould be used instead.Firewall. Either software or a combination of hardware and software, thatimplements security policy by governing traffic between two or more networks ornetwork segments. Firewalls are used to protect internal networks, servers andworkstations from unauthorized users or processes. Firewalls have variousconfigurations, from stand-alone servers to software on a notebook computer, andmust be configured properly to enable protection.Two-factor authentication. Authentication that incorporates two elements. Thereare three elements of authentication: "what you know" (for example, a passwordor PIN), "what you have" (for example, a digital certificate or a smart card), and"what you are" (for example, a biometric). Two-factor authentication iscommonly used for access to systems that contain data requiring secured access orinformation of which disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm. It is alsoknown as strong authentication, although strong authentication can have morethan two elements.Virtual Private Network (VPN). Uses a public telecommunication infrastructure,such as the Intemet, to provide remote offices or individual users with secureaccess to their organization's network.
