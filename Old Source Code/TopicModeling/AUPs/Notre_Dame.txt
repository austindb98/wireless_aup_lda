2.2 Use
 only those
 information
 technology
 resources
 they
 are authorized
 to use,
 and use
 them
 only in 
the manner 
and 
to the
 extent
 authorized.
 All 
users
 of these resources
 must
 respect
 the 
privacy
 of other users
 and 
their
 accounts,
 regardless
 of whether
 those
 accounts
 are securely
 protected.
 Accounts,
 passwords,
 and
 access
 to University
 information
 technology
 resources
 may
 not, under any
 circumstances,
 be shared
 with,
 transferred
 to, or used by, 
persons
 other
 than
 those
 to whom they
 have
 been
 assigned
 by the
 University.
 All Notre
 Dame community
 members
 are
 responsible 
for 
their
 uses
 of University
 information
 technology
 resources
 on and
 off
 campus, 
and
 for
 ensuring
 that 
their
 systems
 are
 maintained
 and
 used
 so they
 do not endanger,
 impede access
 to, or
 threaten
 the privacy
 or security
 of 
others™
 information or 
systems.
  2.3 Respect
 the finite
 capacity
 of those
 resources
 and 
limit
 use
 to the
 extent
 needed
 for
 authorized
 activities,
 so as not
 to consume 
an unreasonable
 amount
 of 
those
 resources
 or to interfere 
unreasonably
 with 
the activity
 of 
other users.
  The University
 may
 require
 users
 of 
information
 technology
 resources
 to limit
 or refrain
 from
 specific uses in 
accordance
 with this principle.  The
 University
 will 
judge 
the
 reasonableness
 of any
 particular
 use in the
 context of 
all
 of the
 relevant
 circumstances.
  2.4 Refrain
 from
 using those 
resources
 for
 commercial
 purposes
 or for
 personal
 financial
 or other 
gain. 
The
 University
 permits 
occasional
 non-commercial
 personal
 use 
of Notre
 Dame™s

 resources, 
interfere 
with job 
performance 
or other
 University

  2.7 Understand
 that uses
 of information
 technology
 resources
 are
 not
 completely
 private.
 The normal
 operation
 and 
maintenance 
of the
 University™s
 technology
 resources
 require
 backup
 and
 caching
 of data 
and
 communications,
 logging
 of activity,
 monitoring
 of general
 use 
patterns,
 and
 other such 
activities
 that
 are 
necessary
 to provide
 service.
  The
 University
 reserves
 the
 right
 to inspect 
any
 activities
 or accounts
 of individual 
users
 of University
 information
 technology
 resources,
 including
 individual 
login
 sessions 
and
  Page
 2   
communications,
 without
 notice,
 unless 
otherwise
 prohibited
 by law.
  The Uni
versity
 may
 inspect
 such 
information
 technology
 resources
 under 
circumstances
 when the
 University
 determines
 inspection
 is necessary,
 including
 but not 
limited
 to the
 following:
  a. To 
protect
 the 
integrity,
 security,
 or functionality
 of University
 or 
other
 information
 technology
 resources,
 or to 
protect
 the
 University
 from
 harm;
 b. There
 is 
reasonable
 cause
 to believe
 that the user
 has
 violated,
 or is 
violating,
 any
 Notre
 Dame
 policy
 or applicable 
civil
 or 
criminal
 law;
 or c. An information
 technology
 resource
 appears
 to be
 engaged
 in 
unusual
 or unusually
 excessive activity,
 as indicated
 by monitoring
 of 
general
 activity
 and
 usage
 patterns.
  Under
 normal
 circumstances,
 the
 General
 Counsel
 and the
 individual™s
 dean/director
 or vice
 president,
 in 
consultation
 wit
h the Chief 
Information
 Officer,
 must 
approve
 in 
advance
 any
 individual 
inspection,
 other
 than
 that 
which
 is 
voluntary,
 required
 by law,
 or necessary
 to respond
 to emergency
 situations.
  The
 University,
 in its 
discretion,
 may
 use 
or 
disclose the 
results
 of any
 such 
inspection,
 including
 the 
contents
 and 
records
 of individual
 communications,
 as it considers
 appropriate
 to University
 personnel, third 
parties, 
or law
 enforcement
 agencies.
  2.8 Appropriate use of
 Electronically Stored Information
. The University 
recognizes that there is a risk of abuse and misappropriation connected to the access to 
electronically stored information (ﬁESIﬂ), especially when the access is by someone other 

than the regular steward or user of the ESI.  To help guard ag
ainst potential abuse or 
misappropriation, individuals with access to 
ESI 
must:  
  2.8.1. Comply with all 
applicable laws, all applicable University rules and 
policies, and all contracts and licenses.  
Access to ESI 
by those other than the normal 
users or 
stewards must be
 only for lawful purposes, and not for any purpose that is 
illegal, immoral, unethical, dishonest, damaging to the reputation of the University, 

inconsistent with the mission and values of the University, or likely to subject the 

University
 to harm.  
  
2.8.2. Inform and seek collaboration with the appropriate Data Steward when 
accessing and using information stewarded outside of the individual™s own area of 

responsibility.  Stewards have the duty to assure data is being sought for legitimate
 purposes and should assist accordingly.  
See Appendix A for assistance identifying 

University Data Stewards.
  2.8.3.  Obtain
 approval of the appropriate data steward(s) before releasing 
University information or analysis based on University information to
 parties outside 
of the University.  If unsure who the appropriate data steward is, an individual should 

contact 
the Campus Data Steward
 for guidance.  This policy does not interfere with an 
employee™s ability to communicate with government officials and a
gencies in their 
individual capacity or with an individual™s capacity to cooperate in a government 

investigation.  
  
2.8.4. When using samples sizes of three or less, take care not to share information 
and take all necessary precautions to protect confiden
tiality.
    Page
 3   
2.8.5. If information, data, or reports are provided for a specific purpose, that 
information, data, or report should be used for those purposes only.  
  2.8.6. Complete and periodically renew any certification or mandatory training 
courses requ
ired by 
the appropriate Data Steward, with oversight of the Information 
Governance Committee if necessary.  Data Stewards are responsible for deciding, 

maintaining, and monitoring what certifications and training courses, if any, are 

required for access to
 and use of the data they steward.
  All users 
must certify that 
they have reviewed and understand th
is Responsible Use of Data and Information 
Technology Resources
 Policy
 when they are assigned a Notre Dame NetID and 
periodically as follows:
  a) When granted access to resources designated by the Information 

Governance Committee as requiring acknowledgement of this policy; or 
  b) Every five (5) years while having access to any resources designated by the 

Information Governance Committee as requiri
ng acknowledgement of this 
policy.
    This policy
 applies
 to all users 
of University
 information technology
 resources,
 whether
 affiliated
 with the
 University
 or not, 
and
 to all uses 
of those 
resources,
 whether
 on campus
 or from
 remote 
locations.  Additional 
policies
 may
 apply
 to specific information technology
 resources
 provided
 or operated
 by specific 
units
 of the
 University,
 or to uses within 
specific
 units.
 Members
 of the University
 community
 who use
 resources
 not owned 
by the Univer
sity
 must 
adhere
 to this Responsible 
Use 
policy
 when
 conducting 
University
 business.
       Data Steward
 Data Stewards are appointed by the Information Governance 
Committee and will:
   Assign 
information under their stewardship to one of three 

security classifications: public, internal, or sensitive based 
upon the information™s intended use and the expected impact if 
disclosed
;    Bear primary responsibility for decisions regarding data usage 

and handling for the data under their stewardship.  
Stewardship of 
Highly Sensitive
 data elements
, as defined 
by 
the 
Information Security Policy
, is reserved for the 
Information Governance Comm
ittee.  
  Consistent with the guidelines set forth in section 2.8 above, 
cooperate as appropriate with requests to access ESI within 
their control.
