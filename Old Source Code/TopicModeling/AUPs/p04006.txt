Employees may also use other means of electronic 
communication for university purposes; those
 
are governed by the master policy on Digital Communication and the 
Acceptable Use Policy. 
 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
 
CMU recog
nizes the efficiency of employing digital communications 
among
 
its students and employees.  Digital 
communication saves time
, saves
 
money
, and
 
is often the fastest, most effective method of communication among members 
of the CMU community.  At the same tim
e, digital communications can easily be abused, and an email that seems useful and 

sometimes troublesome, the real issue emerges wi
th regard to bulk or group communications, and it is this type of 
communication to which this policy specifically refers.
