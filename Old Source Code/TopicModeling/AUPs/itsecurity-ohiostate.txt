 or other authorized
 agents
 with
 access
 to university
 IT resources,
 data
 or assets) with 
clear
 direction 
for
 the
 safeguarding
 of university
 information assets.
 II. This
 IT security
 policy
 establishes
 the
 overall
 intent
 of 
the
 organization
 to support
 and
 promote
 information
 security
 in all
 its practices.
 III.
 Statements
 created

 particular elements
 of 
the
 information 
security
 practice at
 The
 Ohio
 State
 University 
will be organized into 
existing policies, 
standards, requirements, 
guidelines, 
and practices
. Creation of new 
policies, 
standards,
 requirements,

to support
 the
 intent
 of 
this
 policy
 is allowed.
 IV.
 The
 Office
 of 
the
 Chief 
Information
 Officer
 or its appointed designees 
will
 manage
 the 
IT security
 policy
 and
 its
 derivative
 works.
  V. University organizations 
(e.g., colleges,

 Scope
 A. This
 policy applies 
to all 
colleges
 and 
units
 established by 
The
 Ohio
 State
 University 
that
 exercise any 
IT function
 relating
 to the
 mission
 of 
the
 university except
 for
 those
 specifically
 exempted in writing by 
the
 senior leadership
 of 
the
 university.
 B. This
 policy applies 
to university 
computer
 and 
telecommunications
 systems;
 faculty,
 staff,
 and 
students;
 academic
 and
 administrative
 units;
 affiliated
 entities,
 agents,
 contractors,
 and 
volunteers
 of 
the
 university who 
use and/or administer 
such
 systems.
 VII.
 Rationale
 A. The
 ability
 for
 the
 university 
to meet
 the
 daily needs
 of 
the
 academic, administrative,
 and 
research
 communities
 is facilitated,
 in large
 part, 
through
 the
 use of 
IT.
 This
 technology
 allows 
faculty,
 staff,
 and 
students
 to meet
 their
 diverse 
requirements
 (e.g.,
 collaboration,
 research,
 communication,
 etc.). 
While
 critical
 to the
 business of 
the
 university, 
these
 technologies
 also introduce 
risks. The
 risks
 and
 corresponding 
threats
 associated
 with
 IT 
are
 increasing
 in both number and
 variety.
 Information
 technology
 infrastructures
 are
 increasingly
 complex
 to implement and
 administer.
  The
 advent
 of hacking
 tools
 and persons
 willing
 to distribute 
viruses
 and 
malicious code
 have
 increased 
the
 risks
 to IT organizations and 
the
 assets 
they
 are 
charged
 to safeguard.
 B. University 
mission
-critical
 functions
 supported
 by 
IT systems
 continue
 to expand. 
Although
 some
 data and 
systems may
 not be
 classified
 as mission
 critical,
 they
 nevertheless
 represent
 a significant
 investment
 in resources,
 may
 contain
 sensitive
 data,
 and
 are
 efficient
 methods
 of providing 
a wide 
range
 of education 
related
 services.
 Coupled with
 overall 
system
 integration and inte
rconnectivity,
 university 
systems
 and 
networks are increasingly at 
risk
 to intrusions, 
misuse
 of data, and other attacks 
from
 both
 internal and 
external sources.
 C. A successful
 security
 framework
 is reliant
 upon strong
 leadership
 support
 and
 a comprehensive
 body of effective
 and
 efficient 
IT security
 standards
 and procedures 
that:
 1. Promote
 public 
trust,
 2. Ensure
 continuity
 of services,
 3. Comply
 with
 legal
 and
 contractual
 requirements,
 4. Recognize 
risks
 and 
threats,
 and
 5. Protect 
systems assets
.  VIII.
 Enforcement
 Failure
 to comply
 with
 these
 policies 
may
 result
 in suspension
 of access
 to information
 assets
 and information 
systems 
or both and
 may
 also 
result
 in disciplinary action,
 up 
to and
 including
 termination
 and
 criminal
 prosecution.

 The
 following
 minimum
 security
 requirements
 provide
 the
 foundation
 for
 IT security
 policy development. 
The
 core
 assumptions
 of these
 requirements
 are
 adapted
 from
 the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Risk Management Framework and Security Controls
:  Information Security Standard (ISS)
  Information Security
 Control Requirements (ISCR) 
 A. Risk 
Management:
 The
 Ohio
 State
 University 
shall
 apply 
risk
 management
 techniques 
to balance 
the
 need 
for
 security
 measures
 considering
 the
 cost 
benefit analysis 
to make
 informed decisions
 and
 to aid
 in designing
 and
 implementing
 any 
security
 policies, 
standards,
 requirements,
 guidelines, 
and practices. 
Impact
 upon the
 teaching,
 research,
 and 
service
 mission
 of 
the
 university will
 be 
considered
 as a key
 factor
 in 
this
 process.
 B. Confidentiality, 
Integrity
 and 
Availability:
 The
 Ohio
 State
 University
 shall
 ensure 
that
 its 
IT security
 policies,
 standards,
 requirements,
 guidelines, 
and
 practices address 
the
 basic 
security
 elements of 
confidentiality,
 integrity and
 availability.
 C. Protect,
 Detect, and Respond: 
Security
 policies, 
standards,
 requirements,
 guidelines,
 and practices 
shall
 include 
methods
 to protect against, detect, and 
respond
 to threats
 and 
vulnerabilities
 to unit information and 
systems.
 These
 instruments will be implemented with 
consideration
 of business impact
 and 
resource
 constraints
 for
 all
 university units
 tasked
 with
 their
 implementation.
 D. Identification
 and 
Authentication:
 The
 Ohio
 State 
University 
shall
 implement identification and 
authentication 
requirements
 for
 information 
systems
 and 
services
 that
 protect 
the
 university™s data and
 physical 
IT resources
 in 
the
 most
 appropriate manner.
  E. Access
 Control and 
Authorization:
 The
 Ohio
 State 
University 
shall
 implement access 
control
 and 
authorization policies, plans, 
standards
, and procedures 
required
 to protect 
system
 assets and other 
information 
resources
 maintained
 by its
 colleges
 and offices.
 F. Security
 Audit
 Logging: 
The
 Ohio
 State 
University 
shall
 implement 
a security
 audit
 logging 
capability
 for
 information 
systems,
 including 
computers
 and network devices.
 G. Security
 Management
 and
 Administration:
 The
 Ohio
 State 
University 
shall
 implement
 a university
-wide
 security
 management
 and
 administration
 program.
 H. Process
 Management:  Standards,
 requirements, 
guidelines,
 and practices
 created
 to support
 this
 overarching
 IT Security
 policy
 must
 be reviewed
 and 
made
 available
 to university
 committees
 and appointed
 security
 representatives
 of the
 university 
technical,
 faculty
 and
 general
 user
 communities
 before
 being
 put into
 place. 
These
 reviewing
 organizations 
must
 be explici
tly enumerated in 
the
 draft of each
 process 
management
 document. 
The
 assigned
 groups will 
vary
 based
 upon 
the
 subject
 matter 
of 
the
 document but
 must
 include
 at 
least
 one body
 from
 the
 above general
 categories
 before 
the
 adoption
 of the
 policy,
 standard,
 requirement,
 guideline,
 or practice.
 Instruments
 designed
 through

 process
 will
 be reviewed
 and
 revised
 using
