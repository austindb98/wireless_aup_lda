will be protected from 
intentional, unauthorized, or accide
ntal changes
.

by 
the University 
community
 
when
 
needed.

sensitivity, and criticality to the University.  P
rotection levels must be established and 

access, modification, disclosure, and destruction.  For information governed by law and

Restricted
 
Restricted Data is the most sens
itive 
information and requires the highest 
level of protection. This information is 
usually described as 'non
-
public 
personal information' (NPPI) about 
people or critical business, academic 
or research operations under the 
purview of the Information Owner 
(Data Custodian). Restricted data 
includes, but is not limited to, data that 
University is required to protect under 
regulatory or legal requirements. 
Unauthorized disclosure or access 
may 1) subject Rutgers to legal risk, 
2) adversely affect its reputatio
n, 3) 
jeopardize its mission, and 4) present 
liabilities to individuals (for example, 
HIPAA penalties).
