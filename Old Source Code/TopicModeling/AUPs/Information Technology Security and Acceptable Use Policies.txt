Proven, standard algorithms such as DES, Blowfish, RSA, RC5 and IDEA should be used as the 
basis for encryption technologies. These algorithms represent the actual cipher used for an 
appro
ved application. For example, Network Associate's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) uses a 
combination of IDEA and RSA or Diffie

Application Service 
Providers
 
(ASP) Policy
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This document de
scribes Information Security's requirements of Application Service Providers 
(ASPs) that engage with University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
 
      
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This policy applies to any use of Application Service Providers by University of Louisiana at 
Lafay
ette, independent of where hosted. 
 
        
 
3.0 Policy 
 
3.1 Requirements of Project Sponsoring 
Division
 
The ASP Sponsoring 
Division
 
must first establish that its project is an appropriate one for the 
ASP model, prior to engaging any additional infrastruct
ure teams within University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette or ASPs external to the company. The person/team wanting to use the ASP service 
must confirm that the ASP chosen to host the application or project complies with this policy. 
The Business Function to be
 
outsourced must be evaluated against the following: 
 
 
1.
 
The requester must go through the ASP engagement process with the ASP Tiger Team to 
ensure affected parties are properly engaged.
 
2.
 
In the event that University of Louisiana at Lafayette data or applicat
ions are to be 
manipulated by, or hosted at, an ASP's service, the ASP sponsoring 
division
 
must have 
written, explicit permission from the data/application owners. A copy of this permission 
must be provided to Information Technology Security. 
 
3.
 
The informat
ion to be hosted by an ASP must fall under the "Minimal" or "More 
Sensitive" categories. Information that falls under the "Most Sensitive" category may not 
be outsourced to an ASP. Refer to the 
Information Sensitivity Policy
 
for additional 
details.
 
4.
 
If the 
ASP provides confidential information to University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the 
ASP sponsoring 
division
 
is responsible for ensuring that any obligations of 
confidentiality are satisfied. This includes information contained in the ASP's application. 
Univ
ersity of Louisiana at Lafayette's legal services department should be contacted for 
further guidance if questions about third
-
party data arise. Projects that do not meet these 
criteria may not be deployed to an ASP.
 
        
 
3.2 Requirements of the Applic
ation Service Provider
 
Information Technology Security has created an associated document, entitled 
ASP Security 
Standards
 
that sets forth the minimum security requirements for ASPs. The ASP must 
demonstrate compliance with these Standards in order to be c
onsidered for use. 
 
 
The ASP engagement process includes an Information Technology Security evaluation of 
security requirements. The 
ASP Security Standards
 
can be provided to ASPs that are either being 
considered for use by University of Louisiana at Lafay
ette, or have already been selected for use. 
 

Page

Information Technology Security may request that additional security measures be implemented 
in addition to the measures stated in the 
ASP Security Standards
 
document, depending on the 
nature of the project. I
nformation Technology Security may change the requirements over time, 
and the ASP is expected to comply with these changes. 
 
 
ASPs that do not meet these requirements may not be used for University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette projects.

ASP 
Security
 
Standards
 
 
1.0 Overview 
 
This document defines the minimum security criteria that an Application Service Provider (ASP) 
must meet in order to be considered for use by University of Louisiana at
 
Lafayette. As part of 
the ASP selection process, the ASP Vendor must demonstrate compliance with the Standards 
listed below by responding in writing to EVERY statement and question in the six categories. 
Information Technology Security  (IT
-
SEC) will clos
ely review the vendor responses, and will 
suggest remediation measures in any areas that fall short of the minimum security criteria. (IT
-
SEC) approval of any given ASP resides largely on the vendor's response to this document.
 
 
These Standards are subject
 
to additions and changes without warning by IT
-
SEC.   
 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This document can be provided to ASPs that are either being considered for use by University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette, or have already been selected for use.   
 
 
3.0 Responding to These S
tandards
 
IT
-
SEC is looking for explicitly detailed, technical responses to the following statements and 
questions.  ASPs should format their responses directly beneath the Standards (both questions 
and requirements) listed below.  In addition, please inclu
de any security whitepapers, technical 
documents, or policies that you may have.  
 
 
Answers to each Guideline should be specific and avoid generalities, e.g.:
 
 
Examples:
 
 
Bad: "We have hardened our hosts against attack." 
 
Good: "We have applied all securit
y patches for Windows 2000 as of 8/31/2000 to our 
servers.   Our Administrator is tasked with keeping up
-
to
-
date on current vulnerabilities that 
may affect our environment, and our policy is to apply new patches during our maintenance 
period (2300hrs, Satu
rday) every week.   Critical updates are implemented within 24 hours.   
A complete list of applied patches is available to University of Louisiana at Lafayette." 
 
 
Bad:  "We use encryption." 
 
Good:  "All communications between our site and University of Lo
uisiana at Lafayette will 
be protected by IPSec ESP Tunnel mode using 168
-
bit TripleDES encryption, SHA
-
1 
authentication.   We exchange authentication material via either out
-
of
-
band shared secret, or 
PKI certificates." 
 
 
4.0 Standards 
 
4.1 General Securit
y

1.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette reserves the right to periodically audit the University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure to ensure compliance with the ASP 
Policy and these Standards.  Non
-
intrusive network audits (basic portscan
s, etc.) may be 
done randomly, without prior notice.  More intrusive network and physical audits may be 
conducted on site with 24 hours notice.  
 
 
2.
 
The ASP must provide a proposed architecture document that includes a full network 
diagram of the University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette Application Environment, illustrating 
the relationship between the Environment and any other relevant networks, with a full 
data flowchart that details where University of Louisiana at Lafayette data resides, the 
applications that
 
manipulate it, and the security thereof.   
 
 
3.
 
The ASP must be able to immediately disable all or part of the functionality of the 
application should a security issue be identified.   
 
4.2 Physical Security
 
 
1.
 
The equipment hosting the application for Univers
ity of Louisiana at Lafayette must be 
located in a physically secure facility, which requires badge access at a minimum.   
 
 
2.
 
The infrastructure (hosts, network equipment, etc.) hosting the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette application must be located in
 
a locked cage
-
type environment.   
 
 
3.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette shall have final say on who is authorized to enter 
any locked physical environment, as well as access the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette Application Infrastructure.   
 
 
4.
 
The ASP
 
must disclose who amongst their personnel will have access to the environment 
hosting the application for University of Louisiana at Lafayette.   
 
 
5.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette's Corporate Asset Protection team requires that the 
ASP disclose their
 
ASP background check procedures and results prior to IT
-
SEC 
granting approval for use of an ASP.  
 
4.3 Network Security 
 
 
1.
 
The network hosting the application must be air
-
gapped from any other network or 
customer that the ASP may have.  This means the Univ
ersity of Louisiana at Lafayette 
application environment must use separate hosts, and separate infrastructure.  
 
 
2.
 
How will data go between University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the ASP? Keep in 
mind the following two things: 
 
 
a.
 
If University of Louisiana
 
at Lafayette will be connecting to the ASP via a private 
circuit (such as frame relay, etc.), then that circuit must terminate on the University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette extranet, and the operation of that circuit will come under the 
procedures and polic
ies that govern the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Partner 
Network Management Group.
 

Page 
20
 
of 
77
 
 
 
b.
 
If, on the other hand, the data between University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the 
ASP will go over a public network such as the Internet, appropriate firewalling
 
technology must be deployed by the ASP, and the traffic between University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette and the ASP must be protected and authenticated by 
cryptographic technology (See Cryptography below).   
 
4.4 Host Security 
 
 
1.
 
The ASP must disclose how and
 
to what extent the hosts (Unix, NT, etc.) comprising the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure have been hardened 
against attack.  If the ASP has hardening documentation for the CAI, provide that as well.   
 
 
2.
 
The ASP must provide
 
a listing of current patches on hosts, including host OS patches, 
web servers, databases, and any other material application.   
 
 
3.
 
Information on how and when security patches will be applied must be provided.   How 
does the ASP keep up on security vulnera
bilities, and what is the policy for applying 
security patches? 
 
 
4.
 
The ASP must disclose their processes for monitoring the integrity and availability of 
those hosts.   
 
 
5.
 
The ASP must provide information on their password policy for the University of 
Louisi
ana at Lafayette application infrastructure, including minimum password length, 
password generation guidelines, and how often passwords are changed.   
 
 
6.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette cannot provide internal usernames/passwords for 
account generation
, as the company is not comfortable with internal passwords being in 
the hands of third parties.  With that restriction, how will the ASP authenticate users? 
(e.g., LDAP, Netegrity, Client certificates.) 
 
 
7.
 
The ASP must provide information on the account ge
neration, maintenance and 
termination process, for both maintenance as well as user accounts.  Include information 
as to how an account is created, how account information is transmitted back to the user, 
and how accounts are terminated when no longer need
ed.   
 
4.5 Web Security 
 
 
1.
 
At University of Louisiana at Lafayette's discretion, the ASP may be required to disclose 
the specific configuration files for any web servers and associated support functions (such 
as search engines or databases).   
 
 
2.
 
Please disc
lose whether, and where, the application uses Java, Javascript, ActiveX, PHP 
or ASP (active server page) technology.   
 
 
3.
 
What language is the application back
-
end written in? (C, Perl, Python, VBScript, etc.) 
 
 

Page 
21
 
of 
77
 
 
4.
 
Please describe the ASP process for doing sec
urity Quality Assurance testing for the 
application.  For example, testing of authentication, authorization, and accounting 
functions, as well as any other activity designed to validate the security architecture.   
 
 
5.
 
Has the ASP done web code review, inclu
ding CGI, Java, etc, for the explicit purposes of 
finding and remediating security vulnerabilities?  If so, who did the review, what were 
the results, and what remediation activity has taken place?  If not, when is such an 
activity planned? 
 
4.6 Cryptograp
hy 
 
 
1.
 
The University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure cannot utilize any 
"homegrown" cryptography 

 
any symmetric, asymmetric or hashing algorithm utilized 
by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure must utili
ze 
algorithms that have been published and evaluated by the general cryptographic 
community.   
 
 
2.
 
Encryption algorithms must be of sufficient strength to equate to 168
-
bit TripleDES.   
 
 
3.
 
Preferred hashing functions are SHA
-
1 and MD
-
5.   
 
 
4.
 
Connections to the
 
ASP utilizing the Internet must be protected using any of the 
following cryptographic technologies: IPSec, SSL, SSH/SCP, PGP.   
 
 
5.
 
If the University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure requires PKI, please 
contact University of Louisiana a
t Lafayette Information Security Group for additional 
guidance.

DB 
Password
 
Policy
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This policy states the requirements for securely storing and retrieving database usernames and 
passwords (i.e., database cred
entials) for use by a program that will access a database running on 
one of University of Louisiana at Lafayette's networks. 
 
 
Computer programs running on University of Louisiana at Lafayette's networks often require the 
use of one of the many internal da
tabase servers. In order to access one of these databases, a 
program must authenticate to the database by presenting acceptable credentials. The database 
privileges that the credentials are meant to restrict can be compromised when the credentials are 
impr
operly stored. 
 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This policy applies to all software that will access a University of Louisiana at Lafayette, multi
-
user production database.
 
 
3.0 Policy 
 
 
3.1 General 
 
In order to maintain the security of University of Louisiana at Lafayette's 
internal databases, 
access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The 
credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the 
program's source code in clear text. Database creden
tials must not be stored in a location that can 
be accessed through a web server. 
 
 
3.2 Specific Requirements 
 
 
3.2.1. Storage of Data Base User Names and Passwords
 
 

 
Database user names and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing 
body
 
of the program's code. This file must not be world readable. 
 

 
Database credentials may reside on the database server. In this case, a hash number 
identifying the credentials may be stored in the executing body of the program's code. 
 

 
Database credentials 
may be stored as part of an authentication server (i.e., an entitlement 
directory), such as an LDAP server used for user authentication. Database authentication 
may occur on behalf of a program as part of the user authentication process at the 
authenticati
on server. In this case, there is no need for programmatic use of database 
credentials. 
 

 
Database credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web server. 
 

 
Pass through authentication (i.e., Oracle OPS$ authentication) must not allow access to 
the
 
database based solely upon a remote user's authentication on the remote host. 
 

 
Passwords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to the 
Password Policy
. 
 
              
 

Page 
23
 
of 
77
 
 
3.2.2. Retrieval of Database User Names and Passwords 
 

 
If stored in a fi
le that is not source code, then database user names and passwords must be 
read from the file immediately prior to use. Immediately following database 
authentication, the memory containing the user name and password must be released or 
cleared. 
 
 

 
The scope
 
into which you may store database credentials must be physically separated 
from the other areas of your code, e.g., the credentials must be in a separate source file. 
The file that contains the credentials must contain no other code but the credentials (i
.e., 
the user name and password) and any functions, routines, or methods that will be used to 
access the credentials. 
 
 

 
For languages that execute from source code, the credentials' source file must not reside 
in the same browseable or executable file dire
ctory tree in which the executing body of 
code resides. 
 
 
3. Access to Database User Names and Passwords 
 

 
Every program or every collection of programs implementing a single business function 
must have unique database credentials. Sharing of credentials be
tween programs is not 
allowed. 
 

 
Database passwords used by programs are system
-
level passwords as defined by the 
Password Policy
. 
 

 
Developer groups must have a process in place to ensure that database passwords are 
controlled and changed in accordance with
 
the 
Password Policy
. This process must 
include a method for restricting knowledge of database passwords to a need
-
to
-
know 
basis. 
 
 
4. Coding Techniques for implementing this policy 
 
[Add references to your site
-
specific guidelines for the different coding
 
languages such as Perl, 
JAVA, C and/or C
 
pro.]
 
              
 
4.0 Enforcement

Extranet 
Policy
 
 
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This document describes the policy under which third party organizations connect to Universi
ty 
of Louisiana at Lafayette networks for the purpose of transacting business related to University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette. 
 
      
 
2.0 Scope 
 
Connections between third parties that require access to non
-
public University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette resou
rces fall under this policy, regardless of whether a telco circuit (such as frame 
relay or ISDN) or VPN technology is used for the connection. Connectivity to third parties such 
as the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that provide Internet access for Univ
ersity of Louisiana 
at Lafayette or to the Public Switched Telephone Network does NOT fall under this policy. 
 
        
 
3.0 Policy 
 
 
3.1 Pre
-
Requisites 
 
 
3.1.1 Security Review
 
All new extranet connectivity will go through a security review with the Informa
tion Security 
department (Information Technology Security). The reviews are to ensure that all access matches 
the business requirements in a best possible way, and that the principle of least access is 
followed.
 
          
 
3.1.2 Third Party Connection Agre
ement
 
All new connection requests between third parties and University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
require that the third party and University of Louisiana at Lafayette representatives agree to and 
sign the 
Third Party Agreement
. This agreement must be signe
d by the Vice President of the 
Sponsoring Organization as well as a representative from the third party who is legally 
empowered to sign on behalf of the third party. The signed document is to be kept on file with 
the relevant extranet group. Documents per
taining to connections into University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette labs are to be kept on file with the [name of team responsible for security of labs].
 
          
 
3.1.3 Business Case
 
All production extranet connections must be accompanied by a valid busines
s justification, in 
writing, that is approved by a project manager in the extranet group. Lab connections must be 
approved by the [name of team responsible for security of labs]. Typically this function is 
handled as part of the 
Third Party Agreement
.
 
    
      
 
3.1.4 Point Of Contact
 
The Sponsoring Organization must designate a person to be the Point of Contact (POC) for the 
Extranet connection. The POC acts on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization, and is responsible 

Page 
32
 
of 
77
 
 
for those portions of this policy and 
the 
Third Party Agreement
 
that pertain to it. In the event that 
the POC changes, the relevant extranet Organization must be informed promptly.
 
        
 
3.2 Establishing Connectivity 
 
Sponsoring Organizations within University of Louisiana at Lafayette that
 
wish to establish 
connectivity to a third party are to file a new site request with the proper extranet group. The 
extranet group will engage Information Technology Security to address security issues inherent 
in the project. If the proposed connection is
 
to terminate within a lab at University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette, the Sponsoring Organization must engage the [name of team responsible for 
security of labs]. The Sponsoring Organization must provide full and complete information as to 
the nature of the 
proposed access to the extranet group and  Information Technology Security, as 
requested.
 
 
All connectivity established must be based on the least
-
access principle, in accordance with the 
approved business requirements and the security review. In no case w
ill University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette rely upon the third party to protect University of Louisiana at Lafayette's network or 
resources.
 
        
 
3.3 Modifying or Changing Connectivity and Access 
 
All changes in access must be accompanied by a valid busi
ness justification, and are subject to 
security review. Changes are to be implemented via corporate change management process. The 
Sponsoring Organization is responsible for notifying the extranet management group and/or 
Information Technology Security whe
n there is a material change in their originally provided 
information so that security and connectivity evolve accordingly.
 
        
 
3.4 Terminating Access 
 
When access is no longer required, the Sponsoring Organization within University of Louisiana 
at La
fayette must notify the extranet team responsible for that connectivity, which will then 
terminate the access. This may mean a modification of existing permissions up to terminating the 
circuit, as appropriate. The extranet and lab security teams must cond
uct an audit of their 
respective connections on an annual basis to ensure that all existing connections are still needed, 
and that the access provided meets the needs of the connection. Connections that are found to be 
depreciated, and/or are no longer bei
ng used to conduct University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
business, will be terminated immediately. Should a security incident or a finding that a circuit 
has been deprecated and is no longer being used to conduct University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
busines
s necessitate a modification of existing permissions, or termination of connectivity, 
Information Technology Security and/or the extranet team will notify the POC or the Sponsoring 
Organization of the change prior to taking any action.

1.0
 
Purpose
 
The I
nformation Sensitivity Policy is intended to help employees determine what information 
can be disclosed to non
-
employees, as well as the relative sensitivity of information that should 
not be disclosed outside of University of Louisiana at Lafayette withou
t proper authorization. 
 
 
The information covered in these guidelines includes, but is not limited to, information that is 
either stored or shared via any means. This includes: electronic information, information on 
paper, and information shared orally or 
visually (such as telephone and video conferencing). 
 
        
 
All employees should familiarize themselves with the information labeling and handling 
guidelines that follow this introduction. It should be noted that the sensitivity level definitions 
were c
reated as guidelines and to emphasize common sense steps that you can take to protect 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential information (e.g., University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette Confidential information should not be left unattended in confer
ence rooms). 
 
 
Please Note: The impact of these guidelines on daily activity should be minimal. 
 
 
Questions about the proper classification of a specific piece of information should be addressed 
to your manager. Questions about these guidelines should be a
ddressed to VP Information 
Technology.

public, is not structured or formatted for the public, and should not be released to the public.  
Ho
wever, release of these data would not cause damage to the University.
 
 
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential contains all other information. It is a 
continuum, in that it is understood that some information is more sensitive than other 
inform
ation, and should be protected in a more secure manner. Included is information that 
should be protected very closely, individual student information, individual personnel 
information, medical information, social security identification, etc.. Also include
d in University 

Page

of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential is information that is less critical, such as telephone 
directories, and email lists.
 
 
A subset of University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential information is "University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette
 
Third Party Confidential" information. This is confidential information 
belonging or pertaining to another corporation which has been entrusted to University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette by that company under non
-
disclosure agreements and other contracts. 
Ex
amples of this type of information include research findings, proprietary software, etc.

-
to
-
other business connections
 
Connections shall be set up to allow other businesses to see only what they need to see. This 
involves setting up both applications and network configurations to allow access to only what 
is 
necessary.

Includes supported FTP clients and Web browsers. 
 
            
 
Envelopes Stamped Confidential
 
You are not required to use a special envelope. Put your document(s) into an interoffice 
envelope, seal it, address it, and stamp it confidential. 
 
            
 
Approved Electronic Mail
 
Includes all mail systems supported by the University Computing Suppor
t Services. These 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, Outlook, 
Open Webmail
,

Telnet
 
Session (access to email via Elm).
 
 
Approved Encrypted email and files
 
Techniques include the use of DES and PGP. DES encryption is available via many different 
public domain packages on all platforms. 
 
 
Company Information System Resources
 
Company Information System Resources include, but are not limited to, all computers, 
their data 
and programs, as well as all paper information and any information at the Internal Use Only level 
and above. 
 
            
 
Expunge
 
To reliably erase or expunge data on a PC or Mac you must use a separate program to overwrite 
data. Otherwise, the
 
PC or Mac's normal erasure routine keeps the data intact until overwritten. 
The same thing happens on UNIX machines, but data is much more difficult to retrieve on UNIX 
systems. 
 
            
 
Individual Access Controls
 
Individual Access Controls are metho
ds of electronically protecting files from being accessed by 
people other than those specifically designated by the owner. On UNIX machines, this is 
accomplished by careful use of the chmod command (use 
man chmod
 
to find out more about it). 

's, this includes using passwords on screensavers, such as Disklock. 
 
            
 
Insecure Internet Links
 
Insecure Internet Links are all network links that originate from a locale or travel over lines that 
are not totally under the control of University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette.

complex. Follow corporate
 
guidelines on export controls on cryptography, and consult your 
manager and/or corporate legal services for further guidance. 
 
            
 
One Time Password Authentication
 
One Time Password Authentication on Internet connections is accomplished by using 
a one time 
password token to connect to University of Louisiana at Lafayette's internal network over the 
Internet. Contact your support organization for more information on how to set this up
. 
 
            
 
Physical Security
 
Physical security means either 
having actual possession of a computer at all times, or locking the 
computer in an unusable state to an object that is immovable. Methods of accomplishing this 
include having a special key to unlock the computer so it can be used, thereby ensuring that the
 
computer cannot be simply rebooted to get around the protection. If it is a laptop or other 
portable computer, never leave it alone in a conference room, hotel room or on an airplane seat, 
etc. Make arrangements to lock the device in a hotel safe, or take
 
it with you
. 
When leaving the 
office for the day, secure the laptop and any other sensitive material in a locked drawer or 
cabinet.

Password
 
Policy
 
            
 
 
1.0 Overv
iew
 
Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for 
user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette's entire corporate network. As such, all Univ
ersity of Louisiana at 
Lafayette employees (including contractors and vendors with access to University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select 
and secure their passwords. 
 
         
  
 
2.0 Purpose
 
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords, the 
protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change.
 
             
 
3.0
 
Scope 
 
The scope of this policy includes all personnel who have or are 
responsible for an account (or 
any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette facility, has access to the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette network, or stores any non
-
publi
c University of Louisiana at Lafayette information.
 
 
4.0 Policy 
 
4.1 General 
 

 
All system
-
level passwords (e.g., root, enable, NT admin, application administration 
accounts, etc.) must be changed on at least a quarterly basis.
 

 
All production system
-
level pa
sswords must be part of the Information Technology 
Security administered global password management database.
 

 
All user
-
level passwords (e.g., email, web, desktop computer, etc.) must be changed at 
least every six months. The recommended change interval is 
every four months.
 

 
User accounts that have system
-
level privileges granted through group memberships or 
programs such as "sudo" must have a unique password from all other accounts held by 
that user.
 

 
Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or oth
er forms of electronic 
communication.
 

 
Where SNMP is used, the community strings must be defined as something other than the 
standard defaults of "public," "private" and "system" and must be different from the 
passwords used to log in interactively. A keyed
 
hash must be used where available (e.g., 
SNMPv2).
 

 
All user
-
level and system
-
level passwords must conform to the guidelines described 
below.
 
 
4.2 Guidelines
 

Page 
49
 
of 
77
 
 
A. General Password Construction Guidelines
 
Passwords are used for various purposes at University o
f Louisiana at Lafayette. Some of the 
more common uses include: user level accounts, web accounts, email accounts, screen saver 
protection, voicemail password, and local router logins. Since very few systems have support for 
one
-
time tokens (i.e., dynamic 
passwords which are only used once), everyone should be aware 
of how to select strong passwords. 
 
 
Poor, weak passwords have the following characteristics: 
 
 

 
The password contains less than eight characters 
 

 
The password is a word found in a dictionary (En
glish or foreign) 
 

 
The password is a common usage word such as: 
 
o
 
Names of family, pets, friends, co
-
workers, fantasy characters, etc. 
 
o
 
Computer terms and names, commands, sites, companies, hardware, software. 
 
o
 
The words "University of Louisiana at Lafayett
e", "sanjose", "sanfran" or any 
derivation. 
 
o
 
Birthdays and other personal information such as addresses and phone numbers. 
 
o
 
Word or number patterns like aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, 123321, etc. 
 
o
 
Any of the above spelled backwards. 
 
o
 
Any of the above preceded 
or followed by a digit (e.g., secret1, 1secret) 
 
 
Strong passwords have the following characteristics: 
 
 

 
Contain both upper and lower case characters (e.g., a
-
z, A
-
Z) 
 

 
Have digits and punctuation characters as well as letters e.g., 0
-
9, !@#$%^&*()_+|~
-
=
\
`{
}[]:";'<>?,./) 
 

 
Are at least eight alphanumeric characters long. 
 

 
Are not a word in any language, slang, dialect, jargon, etc. 
 

 
Are not based on personal information, names of family, etc. 
 

 
Passwords should never be written down or stored on
-
line. Try to c
reate passwords that 
can be easily remembered. One way to do this is create a password based on a song title, 
affirmation, or other phrase. For example, the phrase might be: "This May Be One Way 
To Remember" and the password could be: "TmB1w2R!" or "Tmb1W>
r~" or some other 
variation.
 
 
NOTE: Do not use either of these examples as passwords! 
 
 
B. Password Protection Standards
 
Do not use the same password for University of Louisiana at Lafayette accounts as for other non
-
University of Louisiana at Lafayette ac
cess (e.g., personal ISP account, option trading, benefits, 
etc.). Where possible, don't use the same password for various University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette access needs. For example, select one password for the Engineering systems and a 
separate passwo
rd for IT systems. Also, select a separate password to be used for an NT account 
and a UNIX account. 
 
 

Page 
50
 
of 
77
 
 
Do not share University of Louisiana at Lafayette passwords with anyone, including 
administrative assistants or secretaries. All passwords are to be trea
ted as sensitive, Confidential 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette information.
 
 
Here is a list of "dont's": 
 
 

 
Don't reveal a password over the phone to ANYONE 
 

 
Don't reveal a password in an email message 
 

 
Don't reveal a password to the boss 
 

 
Don't talk a
bout a password in front of others 
 

 
Don't hint at the format of a password (e.g., "my family name") 
 

 
Don't reveal a password on questionnaires or security forms 
 

 
Don't share a password with family members 
 

 
Don't reveal a password to co
-
workers while on vac
ation 
 
 
If someone demands a password, refer them to this document or have them call someone in the 
Information Security Department. 
 
 
Do not use the "Remember Password" feature of applications  (e.g., Eudora, OutLook, Netscape 
Messenger).
 
 
Again, do not w
rite passwords down and store them anywhere in your office. Do not store 
passwords in a file on ANY computer system (including Palm Pilots or similar devices) without 
encryption.
 
 
Change passwords at least once every six months (except system
-
level passwor
ds which must be 
changed quarterly). The recommended change interval is every four months. 
 
 
If an account or password is suspected to have been compromised, report the incident to 
Information Technology Security and change all passwords. 
 
 
Password cracki
ng or guessing may be performed on a periodic or random basis by Information 
Technology Security or its delegates. If a password is guessed or cracked during one of these 
scans, the user will be required to change it. 
 
 
C. Application Development Standards
 
Application developers must ensure their programs contain the following security precautions. 
Applications:
 

 
should support authentication of individual users, not groups. 
 

 
should not store passwords in clear text or in any easily reversible form. 
 

 
should 
provide for some sort of role management, such that one user can take over the 
functions of another without having to know the other's password. 
 

 
should support TACACS+ , RADIUS and/or X.509 with LDAP security retrieval, 
wherever possible. 
 
              
 
D. Use of Passwords and Passphrases for Remote Access Users
 

Page 
51
 
of 
77
 
 
Access to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Networks via remote access is to be controlled 
using either a one
-
time password authentication or a public/private key system with a strong 
passp
hrase. 
 
 
E. Passphrases 
 
Passphrases are generally used for public/private key authentication. A public/private key system 
defines a mathematical relationship between the public key that is known by all, and the private 
key, that is known only to the user.
 
Without the passphrase to "unlock" the private key, the user 
cannot gain access. 
 
 
Passphrases are not the same as passwords. A passphrase is a longer version of a password and 
is, therefore, more secure. A passphrase is typically composed of multiple wor
ds. Because of 
this, a passphrase is more secure against "dictionary attacks." 
 
 
A good passphrase is relatively long and contains a combination of upper and lowercase letters 
and numeric and punctuation characters. An example of a good passphrase: 
 
 
"The*
?#>*@TrafficOnThe101Was*&#!#ThisMorning" 
 
 
All of the rules above that apply to passwords apply to passphrases.

Cable Modem
 
Cable companies such as AT
&T Broadband provide Internet access over 
Cable TV coaxial cable. A cable modem accepts this coaxial cable and can 
receive data from the Internet at over 1.5 Mbps. Cable is currently 
available only in certain communities.
 
 
CHAP
 
Challenge Handshake Authenti
cation Protocol is an authentication method 
that uses a one
-
way hashing function. DLCIData Link
 
Connection 
Identifier ( DLCI) 
is a unique number assigned to a Permanent Virtual 
Circuit (PVC) end point in a frame relay network. DLCI identifies a 
particular 
PVC endpoint within a user's access channel in a frame relay 
network, and has local significance only to that channel. 
 
 
 
Dial
-
in Modem
 
A peripheral device that connects computers to each other for sending 
communications via the telephone lines. The modem 
modulates the digital 
data of computers into analog signals to send over the telephone lines, 
then demodulates back into digital signals to be read by the computer on 
the other end; thus the name "modem" for modulator/demodulator. 
 
 
Dual Homing
 
Having conc
urrent connectivity to more than one network from a 
computer or network device. Examples include: Being logged into the 
Corporate network via a local Ethernet connection, and dialing into AOL 
or other Internet service provider (ISP). Being on a University 
of 
Louisiana at Lafayette
-
provided Remote Access home network, and 
connecting to another network, such as a spouse's remote access. 
Configuring an ISDN router to dial into University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette and an ISP, depending on packet destination. 
 
 
DSL 
 
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a form of high
-
speed Internet access 
competing with cable modems. DSL works over standard phone lines and 
supports data speeds of over 2 Mbps downstream (to the user) and slower 
speeds upstream (to he Internet).
 
 
 
Fram
e Relay
 
A method of communication that incrementally can go from the speed of 
an ISDN to the speed of a T1 line. Frame Relay has a flat
-
rate billing 
charge instead of a per time usage. Frame Relay connects via the 
telephone company's network. 
 
 
ISDN 
 
There
 
are two flavors of Integrated Services Digital Network or SDN: BRI 
and PRI. BRI is used for home office/remote access. BRI has two "Bearer" 
channels at 64kbit  (aggregate 128kb) and 1 D channel for signaling info. 
 
 
Remote Access 
 
Any access to University
 
of Louisiana at Lafayette's corporate network 
through a non
-
University of Louisiana at Lafayette controlled network, 
device, or medium.

operational group that is responsible for system administration. Approved server configuration 
guides must be established and maintained by each operational group, based on business
 
needs 
and approved by Information Technology Security. Operational groups should monitor 
configuration compliance and implement an exception policy tailored to their environment. Each 
operational group must establish a process for changing the configurati
on guides, which includes 
review and approval by Information Technology Security.
 
 

 
Servers must be registered within the corporate enterprise management system. At a 
minimum, the following information is required to positively identify the point of 
contact

The most recent security patches must be installed on the system as
 
soon as practical, the 
only exception being when immediate application would interfere with business 
requirements. 
 

 
Trust relationships between systems are a security risk, and their use should be avoided. 
Do not use a trust relationship when some other m
ethod of communication will do. 
 

 
Always use standard security principles of least required access to perform a function. 
 

 
Do not use root when a non
-
privileged account will do. 
 

 
If a methodology for secure channel connection is available  (i.e., technicall
y feasible), 
privileged access must be performed over secure channels, (e.g., encrypted network 
connections using SSH or IPSec). 
 

 
Servers should be physically located in an access
-
controlled environment. 
 

 
Servers are specifically prohibited from operating 
from uncontrolled cubicle areas.
