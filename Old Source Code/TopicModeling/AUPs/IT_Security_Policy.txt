General Administration
 
 
Each user must be made aware of 
IT
 
Security Policy and 
Information 
Technology and 
Resource
s
 
Policy
 
of the University
 
 
Individuals aware of
 
any breach of information system or network security, or 
compromise of computer security safeguards, must report such situations to 
the systems administrator or the departmental representative responsible for 
security in that area.  The administrator must
 
determine if a security breach 
has occurred, and if so, must report the incident to the 
Security Incident 
Response Team (SIRT) at 
sirt@mail.ucf.edu
 
 
System Administrators must acquire prior approval, in the form of
 
a work 
order request, from NOC before making configuration changes or installing 
network devices, such as switches. This process prevents unexpected changes 
from inadvertently leading to denial of service, unauthorized disclosure of 
information, and other
 
problems.
 
 
Each college, school or department should provide Information services for 
their faculty, staff, and students, thus eliminating the need for them setting up 
their own services
 
 
Faculty, staff or students must 
NOT
 
establish their own personal web 
servers, 
FTP servers, news servers, electronic bulletin boards, local area networks, 
modem connections to existing local area networks, or other multi
-
user 
systems for communicating information witho
ut the specific approval of NOC 
and 
Computer Services and
 
Telecommunication
 
(CS&T)
 
 
Enterprise services, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), 
Domain Name Service (DNS), E
-
mail, routing, WINS services, firewalls, E
-
mail relay services, and directory services should be run in cooperat
ion with 
NOC and
 
Computer Services and Telecommunication
 
(CS&T)
 
 
All servers must be registered with 
CS&T
 
using the NOC secure server 
registration page 
https://newintranet.noc.ucf.edu
 
 
 
Security protocols, such as SSH and SSL, must be used whenever possible
 
 
Port scanning ou

 
 

permission of NOC
 
and CS&T
 
 
Packet 
sniffing is strictly prohibited
 

Physical Security
 
 
Computing equipment must be placed in an environmentally controlled 
l
ocation (e.g., temperature control, humidity, exposure to water, etc.)
 
 
Computing resources and equipment must be stored in secure locations (server 
room, wiring closets, etc.) with restricted access
 
 
Printers or faxes used for sensitive data must be stored 
in a secure location
 
 
Magnetic media
 
such as hard 
drives, diskettes
, or tapes, must be
 
erased before 
disposal
 
 
A shredder must be used for the disposal of sensitive documents
 
 
UPS is required for networking devices and servers
 
 
Where appropriate security acces
s and authorization documentation must be 
retained a minimum of three (3) years
 
 
Restricted data
, or copy of it, should not be stored o
n 
desktops, 
laptop
s,
 
handheld
, or any portable device (e.g., USB drives, etc.)
 
System Security
 
 
Only authorized personnel m
ust install applications on a server or workstation
 
 
Administrative access to systems will be determined by the local systems 
administrator
 
 
System configuration must be done off line.  The system must not be 
connected to the network until it is at an approp
riate level of security (see 
Computer Security Standards
 
and 
Security Tips for IT
 
for more 
guidance.)
 
 
Whenever system security has been compromised, or even if there is a 
convincing reason to believe that it has been compromised, the involved 
System Administrator must immediately: (a) reassign all relevant passwords, 
and (b) force every password
 
on the involved system to be changed at the time 
of the next log
-
in.  If systems software does not provide the latter capability, a 
broadcast message must be sent to all users telling them to change their 
passwords
 
 
Operating systems and applications must 
be kept current.  Where appropriate, 
all the latest operating and application patches must be applied
 
 
Applications must be 
coded or 
configured with security in mind
 
 
Security, Account, and System level logging must be turned on when a server 
is set up
 
 
All u
nneeded services (e.g., SMTP, Telnet, etc.) must be turned off for 
network devices, such as printers and computers
 
 
Services not intended for the general user must be protected with a host
-
based 
or network
-
based firewall
 
 
Servers must not be used for general
 
purpose computing, such as web 
browsing or reading email and must be strictly used for its intended purpose
 
 
The use of fault tolerant system, such as disk mirroring, server duplexing, or 
RAID is recommended.  It is required for servers that store mission 
or 
business critical data
 

 
Major applications must be installed on separate servers, e.g., mail on its own 
server, Web files on a separate server
, and in general a database server 
firewalled from Internet facing servers
 
 
Maintenance and Service agree
ments wi
th vendors must be kept
 
current
 
User Account Security
 
 
Each user must have a unique user ID. System administrators must be able to 
uniquely identify all users, including name, user ID, association, phone 


for example, are an exception to this rule
 
 

and saved in a secure location for future reference
 
 

not
 
be readable, writeable or executable 
by other 
users. Access to shared resources should be granted only as needed
 
 
Accounts created for vendors to provide services must only be active during 
the time the service is carried out
 
 
Accounts must be re
-
certified annually to ensure that only valid acc
ounts 
remain active
 
 
All user accounts, where possible, must automatically have the associated 
privileges revoked after 
a certain period of inactivity
 
 
Temporary accounts must have expiration dates
 
 
If possible, failed login sessions must be terminated and ac
count locked after 
three to five unsuccessful tries
 
 
Where possible, concurrent logins must be limited to one
