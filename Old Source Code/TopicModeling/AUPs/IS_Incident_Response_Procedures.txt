*!PURPOSE
 Central Michigan UniversityÕs (CMU)
 Office of Information Technology (OIT)
 has adopted the following 
procedures and guidelines for responding to
 information security incidents and to provide operation detail 
to 
complement the 
INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY. 
 These procedures apply broadly 
to 
all Institutional 
Data, and 
further 
appl
y to all faculty, staff, students and third
-party Agents of the University as 
well as any other CMU affiliate who is authorized to access Institutional Data or CMU networks.
 AUTHORITY
 Execution of these procedures 
will be managed by the Chief Information Security Officer
 (CISO)
 under the 
guidance of the TPC 
and Chief Information Officer
 (CIO) and 
as established by the 
INFORMA
TION SECURITY 
POLICY
. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES 
 The security incident response process incorporates the 
INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
 definitions and 
extends or adds the following roles:
 ¥!The Information Security Office (ISO) 
collectively describe
s the CISO, other OIT employees, other 
CMU staff, or outside contractors who
 conduct the technical work to
 1) gather, preserve, and analyze 
evi
dence and 2) return affected equipment to full operations so that an incident can be 
closed.
 ¥!The 
Incident Commander 
is the ISO employee (or designee) who is responsible for assembling all the 
data pertinent to an incident, communicating with appropriate 
parties, ensuring the information is complete, 
and reporting on incident status both during and after the investigation
 ¥!Law Enforcement 
includes the CMU Police, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and the 
U.S. government agencies that prese
nt warrants or subpoenas for the disclosure of information. Interactions 
with these groups will be coordinated with the Office of General Counsel (ÒOGCÓ).
 ¥!The 
Office of General Counsel
 (OGC)
 for the University acts as the liaison between the ISO and extern
al 
Law Enforcement
 and provides guidance on the extent and form of all responses and disclosures to law 
enforcement and the public.
 ¥!Academic and Business O
fficers 
are the 
CMU leaders
 overseeing significant CMU academic and business 
offices and/or 
designate
d for 
overseeing the 
various regulatory frameworks to which the University is 
required to comply.
  EVIDENCE PRESERVATION
 The goal of Security Incident Response is to reduce and contain the scope of a security incident and ensure that IT 
assets are returned
 to service as quickly as possible. Rapid response is balanced by the requirement to collect and 
preserve evidence in a manner consistent with the requirements of rules 26
-34 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Discovery
 and to abide by legal and administrative 
requirements for documentation and chain of custody. 
 PHASES OF 
INFORMATION 
SECURITY INCIDE
NT RESPONSE
 OIT
 utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800
-61 as a guide for 
security incident response that encompasses four phases as shown below in Figure 1:
  
 Figure 1 
Ð Information 
Security Incident Response Phases
 Phase I: 
Preparation
 includes those activities that enable the ISO to respond to a security incident: Policies, tools, 
procedures, effective governance, and communication plans. Preparation also implies that the affected groups have 
instituted the controls necessary to recove
r and continue operations after a security incident is discovered. Post
-mortem analyses from prior incidents 
will 
form the basis for continuous improvement of this phase.
 Phase II: 
Detection and 
Analysis 
includes activities to analyze symptoms that might i
ndicate a 
Security 
Incident, 
and to determine the level of severity for those identified as 
Incidents. 
Initial D
etection
 and A
nalysis 
activities 
will 
focus on determining
 the nature of the Security E
vent.  The definitions below
 will guide OITÕs actions through 
this 
phase
.  
 ¥!Security E
vent
 means any unconfirmed or reported concern or complaint related to the inappropriate 
access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the UniversityÕs information, information technologies, or 
informatio
n systems. 
 o!ALL CMU Employees are required to report the theft or exposure of CMUÕs Restricted 
Information
 by the 
DATA STEWARDSHIP POLICY
.  All OIT employees are 
additionally 
responsible for identifying and reporting Security Events as defined by the 
INFORMATION 
SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY
. No matter where the intake p
rocess begins
, a 
ticket must be created and assigned to the IT_INFO_SECURITY ticketing group. If the employee 
believes that the security incident is likely to be classified as ÒhighÓ severity based on the above 
descriptions, they must also report it to the
ir supervisor. The CISO or designee will review all 
tickets, determine severity and sensitivity, and assign security incident commanders as appropriate. 
For insider threats, see below for appropriate intake.  
In the event that investigation into
 Security 
Event 
yields no evidence of a Security 
Incident
 or Breach
, the Ticket will be closed.
  ¥!Security I
ncident
 means any confirmed inappropriate access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the 
UniversityÕs information, information technologies, or information systems, requiring investigation and/or 
significant follow
-up, and/or non
-routine action. Security incidents r
equiring formal breach response are 
escalated to breach status. 
 o!Examples of security incidents include, but are not limited to:
 !!Unauthorized access to data, especially protected or restricted data
 !!Computing device infected with malware
 !!Denial of Service (
DoS) attacks
 !!Reconnaissance activities such as scanning the network for security vulnerabilities
 !!Web site defacement
 
!!Violation of CMU security policy
 o!Security 
Incidents may 
also 
be established by review of sources
, including, but not limited to:
 !!Monitoring
 systems
 !!Reports from CMU staff or outside organizations
 !!Service degradations or outages
  Detected vulnerabilities will not be classified as incidents. OIT employs tools to scan the CMU 
environment and depending on severity of found vulnerabilities may war
n affected users, disconnect 
affected machines, or apply other mitigations. In the absence of indications of compromise or sensitive data 
exposure, vulnerabilities will be communicated
 and documented,
 and the Information Security Office 
(ÒISOÓ) will pursue
 available technology remedies to reduce risk.
  ¥!Security B
reach
 means any confirmed inappropriate access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the 
UniversityÕs Protected or Restricted data or information technologies requiring formal breach response, 
reporting,
 and/or notification(s)
 (such as those 
required for HIPAA
-related incidents)
. Security Breaches are 
one type of High Severity Security Incidents, as defined below.
  Because t
he activities 
in the next phase 
- Incident Containment, Eradication, and R
ecovery
- will be managed based 
on the level of severity of the 
Security I
ncident
, that level of severity is assigned during
 the Detection and Analysis 
phase of response
. The level of severity is a measure of its impact on or threat to the operation or integrity of 
the 
institution and its information
, and 
determines the priority for handling the incident, who manages the incident, and 
the timing and extent of the response. 
 OIT recognizes three 
levels of 
Security 
Incident 
severity: 
High, 
Medium, 
and 
Low. ¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
High
 Severity
Ó if any of the following conditions exist:
 o!Threatens to have a significant adverse impact on a large number of systems and/or people, such 
as the entire institution.
 o!Poses a potential large financial risk or legal 
liability to the University
 o!Threatens restricted data, such as the compromise of a server that contains names with social 
security numbers or credit card information.
 o!Adversely impacts, either currently or imminently, a core system or service critical to t
he 
operation of a major portion of the University, such as the learning management system or a major 
portion of the campus network.
 o!Poses a significant and immediate threat to human safety, such as a death
-threat to an individual or 
group.
 o!Has a high proba
bility of propagating to many other systems on and/or off campus and causing 
significant damage or disruption.
 o!Indication that a 
Security Breach 
of protected or restricted data has likely occurred.
 o!Expectations for Response 
to High Severity 
Security 
Incide
nts
: OIT expects response time for 
High Severity Security Incidents to be immediate.  The Chief Information Security Officer will 
notify and inform the CIO, then, acting in league with the CIO, coordinate the ISOÕs technical 
investigation and recovery from
 the Security Incident, while the CIO will act as Incident 
Commander and convene a steering team to guide CMUÕs response to the Security Incident.  This 
steering team will include the President, the Provost, the General Counsel, the AVP for University 
Comm
unications, the CISO
, other appropriate business or academic officers
, a
nd, if 
HIPAA
-related, the HIPAA Pr
ivacy and 
Security Officers
.  A ÒLessons LearnedÓ session and Post
-Incident 
Report are required following each High Severity Security Incident.
  ¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
Medium
 Severity
Ó if any of
 the following conditions exist:
 o!Adversely impacts a moderate number of systems and/or people, such as an individual department, 
unit, or building.
 o!Adversely impacts a non
-core service
 o!Adversely impacts a departmental system or service, such as a departmen
tal file server
 o!Disrupts a building or departmental network.
 o!Has a moderate probability of propagating to other systems on and/or off campus and causing 

moderate damage or disruption
 o!Expectations for Response 
to Medium Severity 
Security 
Incidents
: OIT 
expects to respond to 
Medium Severity Security Incidents within 4 hours.  The CISO or appropriate OIT Director will 
act as Incident Commander and will convene a steering team consisting of appropriate CMU 
academic and business officers, OITÕs University Co
mmunications Liaison, and appropriate 
members of the ISO to coordinate recovery and response.  A ÒLessons LearnedÓ and Post
-Incident 
Report are not required unless requested by the CIO or CISO.
  ¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
Low Severity
Ó if it 
exhibits the following characteristics:
 o!Adversely impacts a very small number of systems or individuals
 o!Disrupts a very small number of network devices or segments
 o!Has little or no risk of propagation or causes only minimal disruption or damage in their 
attempt to 
propagate.
 o!Expectations for Response to Low Severity 
Security 
Incidents
: OIT expects to respond to Low 
Severity Security Incidents within one business day.  Recovery and response will be managed by 
staff assigned to the affected service(s).   A 
ÒLessons LearnedÓ is not required, nor is a Post
-Incident Report.
  Phase III: 
Containment, Eradication, and R
ecovery 
includes 
two parts 
Ð 1) the technical 
activities that attempt to 
contain the incident, and if necessary, recover from it by restoring any 
affected resources and/or processes
, and 2) 
the administrative activities required to communicate to affected individuals and the public.
 The technical activities 
could lead to the identification of additional indicators of compromise and 
might shift the 
Incident 
back into the 
Detection and 
Analysis phase. These activities include, but are not limited to:
 ¥!Segmenting or disconnecting a device from the network
 ¥!Stopping or shutting down services on a device
 ¥!Restricting access to one or more technology services
 ¥!Confiscating a CMU
-owned device to perform additional analysis or restoration
 ¥!Monitoring of suspicious activity
 ¥!Creating/modifying firewall rules
 ¥!Changing passwords
 ¥!Installing patches
 ¥!Conducting 
Forensics investigations
, including imaging of devices
 ¥!Resto
ring systems and/or processes
  The administrative activities 
include, but are not limited to:
 ¥!Engaging Beazley
, Marsh,
 or other vendors 
to conduct research into reporting/communication 
requirements, gain access to bulk buys of ID protection services, 
obtain templates for communication
, or 
conduct forensic services.
 ¥!Issuing letters or other communications to affected individuals or organizations.
  Phase IV: 
Post
-Incident A
ctivity
 includes activities
 (such as the ÒLessons LearnedÓ meetings 
referenced 
above)
 to 
analyze the relevant security incident handling procedures with the goals of improving those processes, and to 
reduce the probability of similar future incidents. Post
-incident reports, where applicable, will be created and 
disseminated during th
is phase. The report should minimally contain the following: A description of the security 
incident, the impact or potential impact of the security incident such as system downtime, the classification of any 
data involved in the security incident, and any 
suggestions for improvement of the security incident response process 
or future mitigation strategies.
  Response to every incident, regardless of severity, must include review of all 
applicable response metrics
 with suggestions for improvement if appropria
te.
  
ADDITIONAL 
INCIDENT RESPONSE 
CONSIDERATIONS
 ¥!Escalation
 o!Security Incidents may be escalated at any point in the recovery process based upon new 
developments in the investigation.  Escalation from Low Severity to 
Medium
 Severity may be 
done unilaterally by the CISO.  Escalation from Medium Severity to High Severity will be 
recommended to the CIO by the CISO and escalated by the CIO.
 ¥!Interactions with Law Enforcement 
 o!No communications with external law enforcement author
ities may occur without the approval of 
the Office of General Counsel.
 The ISO works with these entities, where authorized by OGC, to 
determine the information requirements and to share the minimum necessary information as 
required for incident response.
 ¥!Communications Plan
 o!Public communications about a Security Incident will be released by University Communications 
or their designee after appropriate conversation with the incident steering committee, or, at 
minimum, the OGC.
  Should a Security Incident bec
ome a Security Breach or suspected Security 
Breach, both the CISO and CIO should be notified immediately. 
 ¥!Privacy
 o!All incident response procedures will follow the current privacy requirements as set out in 
the
 DATA STEWARDSHIP POLICY
. Exceptions must be approved by OGC.
 ¥!Insider Threats
 o!In the case that the Incident Commander is a person of interest in a security incident:
 !!The Chief Information Security Officer will act in their stead or appoint a designee to act 
on their behalf.
  o!In the case that the Chief Information Security Officer is a person of interest in a security incident:
 !!The normal intake process should not be use
d. Instead, the security incident should be 
reported directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who will act in their stead or 
appoint a designee to act on their behalf.
 o!In the case that another CMU administrative authority is a person of interest in 
an incident:
 !!The Chief Information Security Officer will work with the remaining administrative 
authorities in the Chief Information Security OfficerÕs reporting line to designate a 
particular point of contact or protocol for communications.
