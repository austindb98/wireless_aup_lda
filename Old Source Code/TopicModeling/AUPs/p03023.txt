POLICY:
 
 
Central Michigan University
 
provides 
its faculty, staff, and students with the means to communicate electronically with 
others, and it is the policy of CMU to exercise exclusive management rights to the methods and means of such 
communication.  No faculty member, staff member, or student may 
develop and/or use an electronic mailing list or otherwise 
communicate electronically in a fashion inconsistent with the purposes and procedures 
that 
are described below in this 
document.  These procedures 
articulate the audiences to which CMU students and
 
employees may freely communicate
 
using 
CMU digital communication resources 
and identifies ways that CMU students and employees might communicate with those 
audiences to which they, through this same policy, would not ordinarily have access.
  
 
 
This policy
 

specific audiences are encouraged to develop internal policies, procedures, and/or guidelines to govern communications to 
their audience(s).
 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
 
CMU recognizes the efficiency of employing digital communications among its students and employees.  Digital 
communication saves time, saves money, and is often the fastest, most effective method of communication among members 
of the CMU com
munity.  At the same time, digital communications can easily be abused, and an email that seems useful and 

sometimes troublesome, t
he real issue emerges with regard to bulk or group communications, and it is this type of 
communication to which this policy specifically refers. 
 
 
PROCEDURES:
 
 
Part I:  Opportunities for the CMU student or employee to employ digital communications
 
 
Any fa
culty member, staff member, or student may develop a mailing list or otherwise communicate electronically 

supervisory, collaborative, or instructi
onal relationship.
  
For example, a business officer may maintain a mailing list of 
her/his direct reports or the employees in her/his division or department, a faculty member may maintain a mailing list of th
e 
students in each of her/his classes or a lists
erv list of her/his advisees, or a committee chair may develop a SharePoint site or 
WebEx room for the use of members of her/his committee. The CMU Help Desk (989.774.3662) is available to provide 
assistance with the various forms of digital communication 
available to CMU faculty, staff, and students.
