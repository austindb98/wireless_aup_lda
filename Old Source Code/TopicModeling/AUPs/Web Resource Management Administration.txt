Purpose:This document explains the University policy concerning the responsible management
of the UNC Asheville Web pages that have broad impact to both internal and external
audiences.
Scope:By the technical nature of the World Wide Web (Web), issues of distributive and
shared maintenance of these tools have broad institutional impact both internally and
externally for the University. Official Web pages and applications address campus-wide
data management needs at the division, department and unit level. This policy
provides the structure necessary to assist the university community in the design,
review, implementation and support of the Official Web Presence at UNC Asheville.
Policy:Each division or departmental unit will assume responsibility for its Web content.
Revision History

Departmental units will designate a 
Web Custodian
 for the Web content owned by

divisions and departments should adhere.

Services and Information Technology Services form the core of the committee with

out of compliance, addresses concerns and suggestions by the UNC Asheville
community. Included in upholding standards will be review and possible removal of
the following:
