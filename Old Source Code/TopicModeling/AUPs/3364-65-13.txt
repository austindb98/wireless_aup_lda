The requirements put forth in this policy and itssupporting policies are designed to ensure that due diligence is exercised in the protectionof information, systems and services. This policy describes fundamental practices ofinformation security that are to be applied by university organizations to ensure thatprotective measures are implemented and maintained.ScopeThe scope of this information technology policy includes university computer andtelecommunications systems and the employees, contractors, temporary personnel andother agents of the university who use and administer such systems.(D)   Requirements
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               2University organizations shall exercise due diligence to ensure that computer andtelecommunications systems and services that conduct or support university functions aresecure, and that the information contained within those systems and services is protectedfrom unauthorized disclosure, modification or destruction, whether accidental orintentional.(1) The following minimum security requirements provide the foundation for universitysecurity policy development and are described in more detail in this policy.(a) Risk management: Organizations shall apply risk management techniques tobalance the need for security measures (paragraph D (2)(a)).(b)Confidentiality, integrity and availability: Organizations shall ensure that theirsecurity policies, plans and procedures address the basic security elements ofconfidentiality, integrity and availability (paragraph D (2)(b)).(c)Protect, detect and respond: Security plans and policies shall include methods toprotect against, detect, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities to universityinformation and systems (paragraph D (2)(c)).(d)Identification and authentication: University information technology systems shallimplement an identification and authentication process for information systemsand services (paragraph D (2)(d)).(e)Access control and authorization: Access control and authorization policies, plansand procedures are required to protect system assets and other informationresources maintained by the university (paragraph D (2)(e)).(f)Security audit logging: Security audit logging capabilities on information systems,including computers and network devices, shall be implemented and utilized inaccordance with the risk assessment (paragraph D (2)(0).(2) Minimum security requirements:(a) Risk management. Organizations shall adopt a risk management methodologythat incolÿorates the following risk management processes:Risk assessment positions organizations to determine effectively the extentof potential threats and the associated risk. The goal of conducting a riskassessment is to identify organization-specific controls that are appropriatefor reducing or eliminating risk;ORisk mitigation addresses the prioritization, evaluation andimplementation of strategically selected controls. The goal of riskmitigation is to select and implement controls that reduce risk to anacceptable level; and
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               3Evaluation and assessment is a process comprised of activities thatrecognize and respond to new and changing risks, measure theeffectiveness of implemented controls, and modify controls to reflectchanges in the three aspects of risk management: operational, technicaland managerial. The goal of evaluation and assessment is to maintain asuccessful and effective risk management program that continuouslyevolves and responds to changing threats and opportunities.Risk management offers a practical approach to balancing security withoperational requirements and cost. The definition of acceptable risk and theapproach to managing risk can vary for each organization. Risk management is atrade-off in which a certain amount of residual risk is accepted as a balance to thecosts of incremental counten'neasures.The likelihood that adverse events will occur is determined by analyzing possibletin'eats in conjunction with vulnerabilities and potential business impact. Theformula that follows is commonly applied by the information security communityto define and measure such risks as a part of risk management. The formulafurther expresses the relationship of risk exposure factors to counterbalancingsecurity strategies in defining the level of risk:Risk =Impact x ThreatsCountermeasuresRisk factors are defined for each system being measured and receive relativeratings of high (H), medium (M), or low (L).As an example, risk factor ratings for a hypothetical web server that is linked topatient records might be as follows:Ł  Impact - The impact of a successful attack to obtain or change recordsmight be rated as "high."Ł  Threat - The likelihood of an attack might be rated as "medium."Ł  Countermeasures - Alternative measures are robust and therefore wouldbe rated as "high."In this hypothetical example, the robustness of the countermeasures may reduceor mitigate the overall risk, resulting in an acceptable level of risk.(i)Organization risk management practices shall include the elementsdescribed below.(a)   Risk assessment.
3364-65-13 Information security fi'amework                               4All university organizations shall periodically conduct a risk assessmentof system assets that they maintain to address changing threats andorganizational priorities. Risk assessments shall:Ł  Identify IT systems, resources and information that constitute eachsystem and prioritize the relative importance of the system assets;Ł  Identify and document potential threat-sources;Ł  Identify and document system vulnerabilities that could beexploited;Analyze security controls that have been implemented or areplanned for implementation that minimize or eliminate thelikelihood of a compromise occurring;Ł  Determine the likelihood of potential vulnerabilities beingexercised by a threat-source;Ł  Deten'nine the impact associated with the compromise of systemassets;Ł  Determine the level of risk using a rating methodology such ashigh-medium-low;Ł  Identify technical, operational and management controls that canmitigate or eliminate the identified risks; andŁ  Document risk assessment results and control recommendations.(b) Risk mitigationUniversity organizations shall prioritize the implementation of mitigationactions based on the results of the risk assessment. Risks may beeliminated, mitigated, shared with one or more third parties, or accepted.If certain risks are to be eliminated or mitigated the organization shall:Evaluate and compare the security countermeasures available, andthe resources required to implement them, with the resourcesrequired to replace the system assets.Ł  Determine which countermeasures are reasonable to employ.Establish guidelines for implementing management, operationaland technical security controls commensurate with the establishedrisk to system assets.
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               5(c)    Evaluation and assessmentUniversity organizations shall periodically evaluate security controls todetermine their ongoing appropriateness and effectiveness for current andanticipated risks and update controls based upon the findings.(b) Confidentiality, integrity and availability.University organizations shall ensure that internal security policies, plans andprocedures address the fundamental security elements of confidentiality, integrityand availability. Students, patients, and employees expect that sensitiveinformation about them will be shared only with those who need access, that theinformation will not be altered either by accident or malicious intent, and that itwill be available when needed. To this end, university organizations shall:(i)Provide information and services only to those that are authorized andhave a valid business need.(ii)   Protect information so that it is not altered maliciously or accidentally.(iii)Ensure that information and services are provided in conjunction andaccordance with business continuity plan.(c) Protect, detect and respond.IT security plans and policies shall include methods to protect against, detect andrespond to threats and vulnerabilities. At a minimum, organizations shall:(i)Determine how much protection is needed and for how long, per theresults of the risk assessment and then develop policies and proceduresaccordingly.(ii)Review the body of security-related University of Toledo IT policy andimplement its provisions as required.(iii)Develop a methodology to detect when system assets are safe and whenthey are threatened. The methodology needs to include auditing andrecording the status of all protected system assets at intervals appropriateto the risk as defined in the assessment.(iv)Develop a security incident reporting procedure describing how to respondto security incidents that addresses "who," "what," "when," "where" and"how," in accordance with university policy on "Security IncidentResponse."(v)Identify the types of services and protocols permitted by the networksystems, both within the network and crossing the network boundary. Thefundamental policy strategy for services and protocols external to the
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               6network must be to "deny everything" and allow only specific servicesand protocols on a case-by-case basis. University organizations shallemploy security precautions for the management of such services pursuantto university policy on "Boundary Protection."(d) Identification and authentication.Based upon the risk assessment, university organizations shall implement anIdentification and authentication (I&A) process for information systems andservices that require controlled access. The identification process shall require theuser to present a valid identity using a recognizable method. The most commonform of identification is a user ID. The authentication process shall require theuser to present verification of identity in a recognizable format. The mostcommon form of authentication is a password. For I&A, university organizationsshall meet the requirements listed below.(i) System users shall have unique and individual user IDs.(ii)User identities shall be validated before issuing user IDs and other credentials.Procedures shall be established for maintaining and managing system userIDs, including procedures for establishing new user accounts, validatingexisting user accounts, and terminating former user accounts.(iii) All user credentials shall be protected from unauthorized access andalteration.(iv)A security credentials management process shall be developed that ensures theconfidentiality, integrity and availability of security credentials such aspasswords, PINs, biometrics, tokens and certificates. Password processesshall fulfill the requirements of university policy on "Password Security."(v)If a user is locked out of a system due to a forgotten password, data entrymistake while entering a password, or any other legitimate error, organizationprocedures shall verify valid identification and authentication beforepermitting access.(vi) If a university organization is using, sending or receiving legally bindingelectronic records or signatures, the I&A process shall comply with rule123:3-1-01 of the Ohio Administrative Code.(vii)An authentication process commensurate with the risk assessment of thesystem assets shall be established. Robust methods of authentication, such astwo-factor authentication or digital certificates, should be considered to limitaccess to systems that contain data requiring more secure access orinformation whose disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm.(e) Access control and authorization.
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               7University organizations shall implement access control and authorizationpolicies, procedures and plans to protect university information resources. Accesscontrol addresses the securing of systems, both the hardware components and thesoftware components. Authorization addresses the management of permissions toaccess the various system components, including processes for approving accessand restricting access. Restricting access can apply to both invalid users and validusers with limited privileges. To this end, university organizations shall:0)Secure system assets from physical access by unauthorized persons at alltimes. At a minimum, system assets shall be in the control of authorizedpersonnel or protected by a locking mechanism.(ii) Manage systems with appropriate access control processes and well-formulated access control lists.(iii) Use the least-privilege method for granting access to system assets.(iv) Subject all personnel with access to system assets to a vetting process that iscommensurate with the system assets risk assessment.(v)Ensure that systems can detect and deny unauthorized transaction attempts byany user. Unauthorized attempts shall be logged in accordance with thesecurity audit logging requirements defined in paragraph (f) below.(vi) Implement any restrictions to accessing systems outside of normal worldnghours.(vii) Ensure that the access control methodology can disable user privileges tothose who no longer require access.(f)  Security audit logging.University organizations shall implement security audit logging on informationsystems such as computers, network devices, routers, firewalls, and applications.Audit logging shall be commensurate with the organization's risk assessmentfindings.The purpose of audit logging is to maintain a consistent and reliable record ofsystem activity. When properly implemented, audit logging can serve as apreventive measure as well as a forensic aid. A comprehensive record of"who-did-what-when" can discourage asset abuse or be a vital form of evidence toprove culpability or prosecute a perpetrator. University organizations shall:(i)Enable security audit features for system assets and configure themto be sufficient to track attempted security breaches. Organizationsshall ensure that their audit strategy captures the informationnecessary to identify who is accessing university system assets,
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               8access attempts and failures, and violations of security policy.Appropriate processes shall be put in place to review and analyzethe logs commensurate with the organization's risk assessment.Audit logs shall be protected fi'om tampering and available forreview.(ii)   Ensure the confidentiality and security of audit information.(iii)(3)(5)(4)(2)(E)Ensul'e a separation of duties, where possible, between personneladministering access control functions and those administeringsecurity audit logging functions. If these functions cannot beseparated, organizations shall document the reasons and develop aprocess to address conflict of interest concerns.(iv)Ensure that audit logs capture information sufficient to satisfy aninquiry to determine timing, events, impact and ownership of bothnormal system activity and violations of policy, whether security-related or business-related. Based upon a deliberate assessment ofthe organization, application, information and risk, determine anappropriate data collection scheme and retention schedule for auditlogs sufficient to associate specific users with events that breachprotocol. If logs are subject to an investigation, they shall bepreserved as long as needed.Definitions(1) Access control list. A list of entities and their authorized access rights to aresource.Authorization. A grant to a requesting entity (computer, system, person orprocess) for access to a protected system and its resources. Not all entities willhave access to all university information. Authorization requirements can beimplemented using techniques such as access control lists, file and resourcepermissions, and digital certificates.Availability. The assurance that information and services are delivered whenneeded. Certain data must be available on demand or on a timely basis.Infolanation systems that must ensure availability will likely deploy techniquessuch as uninten'upted power supplies or system redundancy.Biometrics. Biological characteristics such as fingerprint, face or retinal bloodvessel patterns used by authentication devices to allow an individual access toinformation, services or other resources.Confidentiality. The assurance that information is disclosed only to those systemsor persons who are intended to receive the information. Areas in whichconfidentiality may be important include nonpublic customer information, patientrecords, information about a pending criminal case, or infrastructure
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               9specifications. Information systems that must ensure confidentiality will likelydeploy techniques such as passwords, and could possibly include encryption.(6)Data. Coded representation of quantities, objects and actions. The word, "data,"is often used interchangeably with the word, "information," in common usage andin this policy.(7)Digital certificate. An attachment to an electronic message used for securitypurposes. The most common use of a digital certificate is to verify that a usersending a message is who he or she claims to be and to provide the receiver withthe means to encode a reply.(8)Firewall. Either software or a combination of hardware and software thatimplements security policy governing traffic between two or more networks ornetwork segments. Firewalls are used to protect internal networks, servers andworkstations from unauthorized users or processes. Firewalls have variousconfigurations, from stand-alone servers to software on a notebook computer, andmust be configured properly to enable protection.(9)Identification and authentication. The verification of the identity of a requestingentity (a person, computer, system or process). Once it is determined who mayhave access to a system, the identification and authentication (I&A) process helpsto enforce access control to the system by verifying the identity of the entity.Systems may use a variety of techniques or combinations of techniques, such asuser ID, password, personal identification number, digital certificates, securitytokens or biometrics, to enforce I&A, depending upon the level of access controlrequired to protect a particular system.(10) Integrity. The assurance that information is not changed by accident or through amalicious or otherwise criminal act. Because students, patients, and employeesdepend upon the accuracy of data in university databases, organizations mustensure that data is protected from improper change. Information systems thatmust ensure integrity will likely deploy techniques such as scheduled comparisonprograms using cryptographic techniques and audits.(11) Least-Privilege. A method for assigning privileges in a system. The objective isto assign only those privileges that are necessary to perform the requiredfunctions, and ensure that other privileges are not assigned and cannot beimproperly accessed. For example, a typical system user should not be assignedrights to read, write and execute all of a department's files when the user onlyrequires the ability to read a subset of these files to do an assigned job.(12) Malicious code. Collective term for program code or data that is intentionallyincluded in or inserted into an information system for unauthorized purposeswithout the knowledge of the user. Examples include viruses, logic bombs,Trojan horses and worms.
3364-65-13 Information security framework                               10(13) Risk assessment. A process for analyzing threats to and the vulnerabilities ofinformation systems as well as determining the potential impact that the loss ofinformation or system capabilities would have on the organization. Riskassessments provide a foundation for risk management planning and theattainment of optimal levels of security.(14) Risk management. A discipline concerned with the planning, implementing andmonitoring of processes for the identification, measurement, control andminimization of security risks to information systems at a level commensuratewith the value of the assets to be protected. Risk management attempts tomaximize the results of positive events and minimize the results of adverseevents.(15) Risk mitigation. A systematic methodology used to reduce risk by employingone of the following risk options: a'isk assumption, risk avoidance, risk limitation,risk planning, risk transference.(16) Security controls. Management, operational and technical policies, proceduresand tools required to achieve and maintain the necessary level of assurance ofconfidentiality, integrity and availability.(17) Security token. A portable, physical device that enables pre-approved access todata or systems. An example is a security-enabled key fob.(18) System assets. Information, hardware, software and services required to supportthe business of the university, and identified during the risk assessment processas assets that need to be protected.(19) Threat. An event with the potential to cause harm to an information technologyprocess or service. A threat can be natural, human or environmental.(20) Two-factor authentication. Authentication that incorporates two elements.There are three elements of authentication: "what you know" (for example, apassword or PIN), "what you have" (for example, a digital certificate or a smartcard), and "what you are" (for example, a biometric). Two-factor authenticationis commonly used for access to systems that contain data requiring secure accessor information when disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm. It isalso known as strong authentication, although strong authentication can havemore than two elements.(21)Users. For the purposes of this policy, users are defined as employees,contractors, temporary personnel and other agents of the university whoadminister or use privately-owned (if authorized) or university-owned computerand telecommunication systems on behalf of the university.(22) Vetting process. A verification process used to validate the identity andtrustwo1ÿhiness of a person who is seeking access to computer systems andnetworks.
