technology systems are exposed to threats from the global community.  USF must take all 
actions possible to protect the identity information that it 
maintains in its technology 
systems.  Personal identity information must be protected from proliferation to technology 
systems and media that are not properly secured and authorized. 
 
 
The purpose of this policy is to define the policy, process, procedures
, and requirements that 
all persons and entities shall follow for the security and protection of personal identity 
information that is stored electronically at the University.  The policy relates to the storage 
and access of personal identity information a
nd the protections required, not the usage of 
personal or confidential data which is covered by other policies and statutes.
