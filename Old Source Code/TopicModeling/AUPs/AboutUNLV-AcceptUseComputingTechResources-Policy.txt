READ 
THIS 
POLICY
 UNLV students and employees 
and anyone who accesses UNLV 
computing and information 
tec
hnology resources
 should read this policy.
    THE 
CONTEXT
   UNLV™s computing and information technology resources are dedicated to the support of the 

university™s mission and its core themes to promote student learning and success, advance and 

support 
research scholarship, and creative activity, and foster inclusion and community 

engagement. While advancing the mission and core themes, UNLV respects, upholds, and 

endeavors to safeguard the principles of academic freedom, freedom of expression, and freed
om 

of inquiry. UNLV™s commitment to the principles of academic freedom and freedom of 

expression includes electronic information.
  The use of computing and information technology resources in a manner consistent with the 

mission and ideals of the universit
y and with the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) 
Computing Resources Policy 
requires adherence to legal statutes, approved policies, and 

responsible behavior, including:
   using only assigned account(s) or account information
  respecting the privacy a
nd rights of other computer users
  protecting the integrity of the physical environments in which information technology 
equipment resides
  complying with all pertinent software license and contractual agreements, and 
  obeying all UNLV and NSHE regulations, 
state and federal laws
.  UNLV seeks to create an atmosphere of privacy with respect to information and 
UNLV 
information technology resources. UNLV 
acknowledges its responsibilities to respect and 
advance free academic inquiry, free expression, reasonable e
xpectations of privacy, due process, 
equal protection of the law, and legitimate claims of ownership of intellectual property.
 Such 
responsibilities are balanced with the acknowledgement that users should be aware that they 
should have no expectation of pr
ivacy in connection with the use of 
UNLV 
resources beyond the 
explicit provisions of university policy and applicable 
federal and state 
law (e.g., NRS 
Chapter 
239, Public Records
). UNLV is a public institution, and because the university must be able to 
respond to lawful requests and 
ensure the integrity and continuity of its operations, use of the 
university's information resources cannot be completely private.
