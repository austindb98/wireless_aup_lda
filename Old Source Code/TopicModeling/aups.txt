9 Introduction
 The California State University (CSU) provides access to information assets for purposes related to its mission 
and to the responsibilities and necessary activities of its faculty, students and staff.
 These resources are vital for 
the 
fulfillment of the academic, research and business needs of the CSU community.
 This policy defines user, 
system administrator and CSU responsibilities with respect to the use of CSU information assets in conjunction 
with the CSU Information Security Policy
.  [The CSU regards the principle of academic freedom to be a key factor in 
ensuring
 the effective application of this 
policy and related standards.
 Academic freedom is at the heart of a universityÕs fundamental mission of discovery 
and advancement of knowl
edge and its dissemination to students and the public.
 The CSU is committed to 
upholding and preserving the principles of academic freedom: the rights of faculty to teach, conduct research or 
other scholarship, and publish free of external constraints othe
r than those normally denoted by the scholarly 
standards of a discipline.
 This policy is intended to define, promote
, and encourage responsible use of CSU information assets among 
members of the 
CSU
 community.
 This policy is not intended to prevent, prohib
it, or inhibit the sanctioned use of 
CSU 
information assets as required to meet the CSUÕs core mission and campus academic and administrative 
purposes. 
 The requirements stated within this policy must not be taken to supersede or conflict with applicable l
aws, 
regulations, collective bargaining agreements or other CSU and campus
 policies.
 1.0 Scope 1.1

! Responsible Use of University Computing Resources at
Miami University
(MUPIM 19.2/OAC 3339-19-02/Student Handbook 1.6/Graduate Handbook 2.7)General Statement 
(MUPIM 19.2.A)
University Computing Resources include, but are not limited to, end-user computing devices, servers, networks,
email, software, printers, scanners, video distribution systems, telephone systems, and other computing hardware
and software, whether owned by the University or contracted from a third party. All such University Computing
Resources are intended for University-related use, including direct and indirect support of the UniversityÕs instruction,
research, and service missions; of University administrative functions; of student and campus life activities; and of
the free exchange of ideas.
The rights of free expression and academic freedom apply to the use of University Computing Resources; so, too,
however, do the responsibilities and limits associated with those rights. All who use the University Computing
Resources must act responsibly, in accordance with the highest standards of ethical and legal behavior. Thus,
legitimate use of University Computing Resources does not extend to whatever is technically possible. Users must
abide by all applicable restrictions, whether or not they are built into the operating system or network and/or whether
or not they can be circumvented by technical means.
This policy applies to all users of University Computing Resources, whether or not a
!liated with the University, and
to all uses of those resources, whether on campus or from remote locations. Additional policies may apply to speciÞc
computers, computer systems, and/or networks provided and operated by speciÞc units of the University, and/or to
uses within speciÞc units. Some of these policies are listed in Sections 19.2.H and 19.5 of this Manual.
Policy 
(MUPIM 19.2.B)
All University Computing Resources users must:
A. Comply with all federal, Ohio, and other applicable law; all generally applicable University rulesand policies; and all applicable contracts and licenses. Examples of such laws, rules, policies,contracts, and licenses include: the laws of libel, privacy, copyright, trademark, obscenity, and child
pornography; the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
which prohibit ÒhackingÓ, ÒcrackingÓ, and similar activities; the UniversityÕs Code of Student Conduct;
the Miami University Policy and Information Manual, the UniversityÕs sexual harassment policy; and all
applicable software licenses. In particular, users must:
i. respect the right of others to be free from harassment or intimidation to the same extent that
this right is recognized in the use of other communication; and
**Policy Library moved to
www.miamioh.edu/policy-library **
2018-2019 policy revisions are located in new policy library

ii. respect copyrights, intellectual-property rights, ownership of Þles and passwords. Unauthorized
copying of Þles or passwords belonging to others or to the University may constitute plagiarism
or theft. Accessing or modifying Þles without authorization (including altering information,introducing viruses or other malware, or damaging Þles) is unethical, may be illegal, and may
lead to sanctions; andiii. not send unsolicited bulk email (ÒspamÓ) or email designed to trick users into providing their
login credentials or other personal information (Òphishing emailÓ
"
).Users who engage in electronic communications with persons in other states or countries or on other systems or
networks should be aware that they may also be subject to the laws of those other states and countries and the rules
and policies of those other systems and networks. Users are responsible for ascertaining, understanding, and
complying with the laws, rules, policies, contracts, and licenses applicable to their particular uses.Miami University extends these policies and guidelines to systems outside the University that are accessed via the
UniversityÕs facilities (e.g., electronic mail or remote logins using the UniversityÕs Internet connections).
1. Use only those University Computing Resources that they are authorized to use and use them only in
the manner and to the extent authorized. Ability to access University Computing Resources does not, by
itself, imply authorization to do so. Users are responsible for ascertaining what authorizations are necessary
and for obtaining them before proceeding. Accounts, passwords, and other authentication mechanisms, may
not, under any circumstances, be shared with, or used by, persons other than those to whom they have been
assigned by the University.
2. Respect the Þnite capacity of University Computing Resources and limit use so as not to consume an
unreasonable amount of those resources or to interfere unreasonably with the activity of other users
.Although there is no set bandwidth, disk space, CPU time, or other limit applicable to all uses of University
Computing Resources, the University may require users of those resources to limit or refrain from speciÞc uses
in accordance with this principle. The reasonableness of any particular use will be judged in the context of all
of the relevant circumstances.
3. Limit the personal use of University Computing Resources and refrain from using those resources for
personal commercial purposes or for personal Þnancial or other gain.
 Personal use of UniversityComputing Resources is permitted when it does not consume a signiÞcant amount of those resources, does
not interfere with the performance of the userÕs job or other University responsibilities, and is otherwise in
compliance with this and other University policy. Further limits may be imposed upon personal use in
accordance with normal supervisory procedures.
4. Refrain from stating or implying that they speak on behalf of the University and from using University
trademarks and logos without authorization to do so. A!liation with the University does not, by itself, implyauthorization to speak on behalf of the University. Authorization to use University trademarks and logos may
be granted only by Miami University. The use of appropriate disclaimers is encouraged. Personal web pages
linked to the University Web should disclaim association with Miami University.
Enforcement 
(MUPIM 19.2.C)
Whenever it becomes necessary to enforce University rules or policies, an authorized administrator may: disallow
network connections by certain computers (even departmental and personal ones); require adequate identiÞcation of
computers and users on the network; undertake audits of software or information on shared systems where policy
violations are possible; take steps to secure compromised computers that are connected to the network; or deny
access to computers, the network, and institutional software and databases.
Sanctions 
(MUPIM 19.2.D)

Users who violate this policy may be denied access to University Computing Resources and may be subject to other
penalties and disciplinary action, both within and outside of the University. Violations will normally be handled
through the University disciplinary procedures applicable to the relevant user. Alleged violations by students will
normally be investigated, and the O!ce of Ethics and Student Conßict Resolution will normally impose any penaltiesor other discipline.However, the University, through its information managers, may suspend or block access to an account prior to the
initiation or completion of such procedures; when it reasonably appears necessary to do so, and in order to protect
the integrity, security, or functionality of University Computing Resources or other computing resources; or to protect
the University from liability.
The University may also refer suspected violations of applicable law to appropriate law enforcement agencies.
Privacy and Security 
(MUPIM 19.2.E)
The University employs various measures to protect the security of University Computing Resources and users
accounts. However, users should be aware that the University does not and cannot guarantee such security.
Users should also be aware that their uses of University Computing Resources are not private. While the University
does not routinely monitor individual usage of  [University Computing Resources, the normal operation and
maintenance of University Computing Resources require the backup and caching of data and communications, the
logging of activity, the monitoring of usage patterns, and other such activities that are necessary for the rendition of
service. Systems or technical managers, as part of their technical responsibilities, may occasionally need to diagnose
or solve problems by examining the contents of particular Þles. Data from University Computing Resources may be
used to evaluate the e!ciency of University operations and personnel.The University may also monitor the activity and accounts of individual users of University Computing Resources,
including individual sessions and communications, without notice when:1. the user has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, as by posting to Usenet or a web site;2. it reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of University
Computing Resources or other computing resources or to protect the University from liability;
3. there is reasonable cause to believe that the user has violated, or is violating, any University policy;
4. an account or device appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the
monitoring of general activity and usage patterns; or
5. it is otherwise required or permitted by law.
Any such individual monitoring, other than that speciÞed in (1), or required by law, or necessary to respond to
perceived emergency situations, must be authorized in advance by the Vice President for Information Technology or
a designee of same.The University, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any such general or individual monitoring, including the
contents and records of individual communications, to appropriate University personnel or law enforcement agencies
and may use those results in appropriate University disciplinary proceedings. Communications made by means of
University Computing Resources are also generally subject to OhioÕs Public Records Statute to the same extent as
they would be if made on paper.
The UserÕs Responsibilities 
(MUPIM 19.2.F)
1. Be aware of the limits of computer security
. Although the University employs various measures to protect
the security of its computing resources and user accounts, users should be aware that the University cannot
guarantee such security. Users should therefore engage in Òsafe computingÓ practices by establishing

appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding their passwords, and changing them regularly.
2. Be responsible for backing up and protecting personal Þles.
 Although the University under certaincircumstances may provide storage space and under certain circumstances that storage may be backed up,
Miami University assumes no responsibility for the loss or recovery of personal Þles.
3. Be responsible for protecting Miami data. 
All users have a responsibility to protect Miami data from
unauthorized disclosure.
The UniversityÕs Responsibilities 
(MUPIM 19.2.G)
The University owns various computers and the entire internal computer networks used on campus. The University
also has various rights to the software and information residing on, developed on, or licensed for, these computers
and networks. The University has the responsibility to administer, protect, and monitor this aggregation of
computers, software, and networks. SpeciÞcally, purposes of the UniversityÕs information technology management
are to:
1. manage computing resources so that members of the University community beneÞt equitably from their use;
2. protect University computers, networks and information from destruction, tampering, and unauthorized
inspection and use;3. communicate University policies and the responsibilities of individuals systematically and regularly in a variety
of formats to all parts of the University community;4. establish and support reasonable standards of security for electronic information that community members
produce, use, or distribute. Standards for security and access are elaborated in the document ÒMiami
University Computing Security Policy,Ó as well as in documents derived from it;
5. monitor policies and propose changes in policy as events or technology warrant.
Other Miami University Computing Policies 
(MUPIM 19.2.H)
ÒResponsible Use of Computing Resources at Miami UniversityÓ was adapted from The Ohio State UniversityÕs Policy
on Responsible Use of University Computing Resources
. Miami University is grateful to The Ohio State University forallowing us to use its policy as a model.Additional policies, including the ÒMiami University Computing Security PolicyÓ, elaborate the above policies andoutline procedures for implementation.
Additional policies that are not in this document may apply to speciÞc computers, computer systems, or networks
provided or operated by speciÞc units of the University. Consult the operators or managers of these systems for
further information.Previous (Computer Peripherals and Software Acquisition)

All universityusers will adhere to this policy and associated standards where passwords are used.(1) Password standards will be based upon the results of risk assessments in accordancewith The University of Toledo's "Information Security Framework." The standardwill comprise a combination of password factors: length, composition, aging, lockoutand history. The combination of these factors affect the level of security associatedwith a password, Where feasible, the University's minimum password factors forsystems requiring secured access are as follows:(a) Password length: a minimum of eight characters

Commensurate with the risk assessment of the system assets,organizations shall establish a policy on the method of reinstating a user accountsubject to system lockout. For systems having higher risk assets, users with asuspended account shall be re-authenticated before access is reactivated. For systemshaving lower risk assets, a reset feature may be used before the account isautomatically reactivated, such as having a predetermined time lapse or prompting theuser to provide a piece of additional information that only he or she would know.(3)Uniqueness. When secured access is used, the combination of user ID and personalpassword shall authenticate a unique user. A user account for a university controlledsystem will be associated with a single individual and shall not be established for useby more than one person.(4)Storage. System password files shall be maintained and safeguarded in a manner toprevent unauthorized access. Password files will be backed up to facilitate recoveryfrom system failures, security breaches, disasters, accidents and like events with thepotential to affect systems. Passwords within those files shall be stored in a one-wayencrypted or hashed form and not in plain text.(5)Transmission. Electronic transmission of passwords from one destination to anothershall be protected fi'om unauthorized access at a level conv-nensurate with the riskassessment of the system asset. Encryption of these credentials is expected.(6)Deactivated accounts. Accounts of employees, contractors, temporary personnel andother agents of the university who have terminated or transfen'ed to other work unitsshall be deactivated. Accounts will be deactivated for such users no later than the endof business on the effective date. Accounts associated with involuntary terminationsshall be deactivated immediately upon notification. The user's account may bemaintained in the authentication database until all files owned by the user have beenhandled appropriately; at that time the user account should be deleted.(7)Compromised accounts. Accounts compromised maliciously or by accident shall bedeactivated immediately.

Gardner-Webb University Technology and Acceptable Use Policies
Revised March 19, 2010
The purpose of this policy is to describe the appropriate use and security of University Technological assets,
associated responsibilities, and rights of all Users employing these resources. 
All Users of University Technology
assets are expected to be familiar with each policy contained here within and the consequences of violation as listed
below. 
This policy supersedes all previous Gardner-Webb University Computer Usage Policies.
Violation of these contained policies may result in the immediate suspension of computer account and network
access pending investigation resolution. 
Depending on frequency and/or severity, the offender may lose all
computer account and network access in addition to facing the appropriate University judicial review. 
The penaltiesmay include suspension or dismissal from the University and/or criminal prosecution where warranted.
Network Security and Privacy Policies:
Unauthorized attempts to gain privileged access or access to any account or system not belonging to you on any
University system are expressly 
prohibited.
Creation of any program, Web form, and/or any other mechanism designed to gain privileged account information is
prohibited without the written 
permission of the Provost and Associate Vice President for Technology Services.
Computer and network accounts are assigned to each individual uniquely and are considered confidential in nature.
Individual accounts cannot be 
transferred to or used by another person. 
Given that access allows the User to
retrieve personal information of the individual assigned the account, sharing 
of accounts and/or passwords is not
permitted.
Each User is personally responsible for the proper use of his/her account including all activity associated with
his/her account. 
All illicit activity that can be traced to a User account will result in immediate termination of the
account until the investigation is complete. 
Users who do not safeguard their User names and passwords may lose
their access permanently, subject to the appropriate University judicial review.
Each system owner is responsible for the security of all systems he/she connects to the campus network
(WebbNet). 
Any system determined to cause 
network degradation and/or attacks others systems as a result of
malicious software, e.g. viruses, worms, Trojans, will be removed from the network 
immediately and without
notification until the system has been made secure.
No University-owned or private system attached to the WebbNet may be used as a vehicle to gain unauthorized
access to any other system whether on or off 
campus.
Anyone believing that a possible security lapse has occurred on any University technological resource or network
MUST report it immediately to 
the respective department chairperson/manager and to Technology Services. The
system and/or computer associated with the lapse should not be used until 
the problem has been investigated and

cleared by the system administrator.
All Users must be aware that Gardner-Webb system administrators conduct periodic security checks of University
systems and networks. 
Additionally, 
outside agencies are annually contracted to assess and challenge the
University systems and network security to ensure a safe operating environment. 
As a result of the analysis, Users
may be required to change their passwords during their next log-in process where an easily guessed password has
been employed.
User files on a University server/system are kept as private as possible. 
Any attempts to access and/or read another
person's protected files will be treated with the utmost seriousness. 
System administrators will not override any file
protections unless deemed absolutely necessary in the performance of their duties, and will treat the contents of
those files as private and confidential information at all times. 
System administrators must make every effort to
communicate with the owner of the files in the event any file protection is overridden.

E-Mail Usage Policies:
Gardner-Webb University has established e-mail as a primary vehicle for official communications with enrolled
students and current faculty/staff.
Every enrolled student, and current faculty and staff member has an official Gardner-Webb University e-mail
address established and assigned by 
Technology Services. 
All University communications sent via e-mail will
be sent to this address. 
Faculty members will use the official University e-mail address to communicate
with a student registered in their classes. 
Additionally, all administrative offices using e-mail to correspond
with 
enrolled students will do so via this address.
Students are expected to check their official e-mail address on a frequent and consistent basis in order to stay
current with University communications. 
A student's failure to receive and read University communications delivered
to his/her e-mail address in a timely manner does not absolve the student from 
knowing and complying with the
content and instructions of such communications.
Students are allowed to forward their e-mail from their official University e-mail address to another provider, but do
so at their own risk. 
Gardner-Webb is not responsible for the handling of e-mail of other service providers. 
Having e-
mail forwarded does not absolve students from knowing and 
complying with the content of communications sent to
their official University e-mail address.
No e-mail may be sent or forwarded through a University system or network for purposes that violate University
statutes and/or regulations and constitutes an illegal or criminal action.
Electronic mail is considered private, confidential information and will be kept as private as possible. Attempts to
read another person's e-mail will be 
treated with the utmost seriousness. 
No University employee or system
administrator will read any mail unless deemed absolutely necessary in accordance with specific job requirements
or by judicial subpoena. 
The University makes every effort to respect e-mail privacy and adhere to state and federal

statues governing e-mail confidentiality. 
However, the University reserves the right to investigate virus and illicit
activity that can be introduced through e-mail systems. 
Additionally, if requested by the person assigned to the e-
mail account, Technology Services may enter the specific e-mail account to assist with problem identification and
resolution.
Users should be aware that deletion of electronic information will not erase such information from the system
storage until overwritten with other data. 
This can be result in the information residing in the University's network
either on various back-up systems/media until such time as the information is overwritten.
Nuisance e-mail or other on-line messages such as chain letters, obscene, harassing, and/or other unwelcome
messages are prohibited.
Unsolicited e-mail messages to multiple Users are prohibited unless explicitly used for University instruction and/or
business purposes. 
Exceptions are 
granted by the appropriate University authority.
All messages must show accurately from where and from whom the message originated, except in cases where
anonymous messages are invited.
Gardner-Webb reserves the right to refuse mail and other communications from outside hosts that send unsolicited,
mass or commercial messages, or 
messages that appear to contain virus and/or illicit material. 
The University will
refuse, filter and/or disregard such messages.
The email/MyWEBB account will be deleted no later than 5:00 pm the day of the employee's seperation from the
university. An email/MyWEBB account may remain active for a specified period of time upon the written request of
the employee's supervisor and the approval of the appropriate vice president or associate provost. The password for
the account will be changed so the employee no longer has access to the account. 
Requests should be submitted 
tothe Associate Vice-President of Technology Services.
This policy does not apply to terminated employees who are current or former students; their accounts will remain
active.
Retiring faculty may request their account remain active indefinitely; these requests should also be submitted in
writing to the Associate Vice-President 
of Technology Services and will be subject to approval by the Provost.
Gardner-Webb Electronic Academic Code:
This principle applies to works of all authors and publishers in all media. 
Respect for intellectual creativity and work
is vital to academic discourse and enterprise. It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledgment, the right to
privacy, and rights to determine the form, manner, and terms of publication and distribution.
Due to the volatility and ease of reproduction of electronic information, respect for the work and personal expression
of others is especially critical in computing environments. 
Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism,
invasion of privacy, unauthorized access, and trade secrets and copyright violations may lead to serious
consequences as deemed appropriate by respective University judicial review panels.
User Responsibilities:
Users of University technological resources, systems, and/or networks are responsible for what they do on the
network. 
Any illicit activity will be taken 
very seriously. 
Each User must maintain a current version of antivirus
software and stay current with any operating systems patch releases. 
The University 
employs software to ensure
that all computers accessing the network are compliant with this requirement, forcing Users to update to the current
applicable 
versions before allowing them to connect to the University network.
Users must respect and adhere to all University policies and federal, state, and local laws to include, but not limited
to, copyrights, intellectual property rights, and confidential information access. 
It is a violation of Gardner-Webb
policy to copy, distribute, share, download or update any copyrighted material without the express permission of the
copyright owner.

Users must respect network access and bandwidth requirements. 
Any User determined to be consuming excessive
bandwidth that negatively impacts the 
performance of University systems, users, and/or networks may be
disconnected from the network without warning.

 Authority: CIO 

 History: Effective date: 18-January-2008 
 
Sources of Authority:  [

Responsible Office(s): ITS 

__________________________________________________________________ 
 
I. Purpose The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidelines for Remote Access 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections to the UNCA trusted 
administrative network. 
II. Scope This Policy applies to all UNCA empl
oyees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers includ
ing all personnel aff
iliated with third parties utilizing VPNs to access the UNCA network. This Policy applies to 
implementations of all VPN that 
are directed through any type VPN Concentrator. III. Policy 
Approved UNCA employees and author
ized third parties (customers, 
vendors, etc.) may utilize the benefits of VPNs, which are a "user 
managed" service. This means that the 
user is responsible for selecting an Internet Service Provider (ISP), coordinating installation, installing any required software, and paying associated fees. Further details may be 
found in the Remote Access Policy. 
Additionally, 1) It is the responsibility of employees
 with VPN privileges to ensure 
that unauthorized users are not 
allowed access to UNCA internal 
networks via their VPN.  [
2) VPN use is to be controlled using password authentication. When actively connected to the admini
strative network, VPNs will force all traffic to and from the PC ove
r the VPN tunnel: all other traffic will be dropped. 
 3) Dual (split) tunneling is NOT permitted; only one network 
connection is allowed. 4) VPN gateways will be set up and managed by the UNCA ITS office. 
5) All computers connected to UNCA internal networks via VPN or 
any other technology must use the most up-to-date anti-virus software that is the administrati
ve standard. Information on this 
software can be obtained from UN
CA User Support, this includes personal computers.  [6) All computers connected to UNCA in
ternal networks via VPN must 
have the latest operating system security patches applied. 
Information on these patches can 
be obtained from UNCA User Support or your college computer consultant.  [
7) Users of computers that are not UNCA-owned equipment must 
configure the equipment to comp
ly with UNCA Usage (#72) and  [Network Security (#78) Policies.  [8) Only ITS approved VPN clients may be used.  [
9) By using VPN technology with personal equipment, users must 
understand that their machines are 
a de facto extension of UNCA's 
network, and as such are subject to the same rules and regulations 
that apply to UNCA-owned equipment, i.e., their machines must be 
configured to comply with all UNCA Usage (#72) and Network 
Security (#78) Policies.  [
10) Peer-to-peer software is
 not allowed over VPN.  [11) Computer with multiple user acc
ounts (ie true multiuser hosts) are 
not allowed to create VPN connectio
ns to the trusted network for the entire host and its users. Note: At this time we know of no way to 
allow single user VPN connections on multiuser computers.  [

IV Procedures 1) To request VPN access, the employee mu
st complete the VPN access request 
agreement form and forward it to their supervisor.  [ The agreement is available at 
www.unca.edu/compcenter/policies/ITS_VPN_Agreement.pdf
  [ V Enforcement 
Anyone found to have violated this Policy may have their network access privileges 
temporarily or permanently revoked.

Recommendation presented by Ken Peter for the Executive Committee. 
 POLICY RECOMMENDATION 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOU
RCES RESPONSIBLE USE POLICY  [
 Whereas: The CSU requires each campus to have a policy on responsible use of information technology 
resources and SJSU does not currently have such a policy, and 
Whereas: Appropriate use of campus technolog
y resources is crucial to course delivery, 
communication, administrative activities, and delivery of employee and student services, thus 
necessitating responsible usage of the technol
ogy, and policies and procedures to avoid misuse, and Whereas: The University Information Technology Bo
ard drafted an acceptable use policy to present to 
the Executive Committee who now forward the 
policy to the Academic Senate for its 
consideration; therefore be it Resolved: That we acknowledge and thank Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo for providing us the framework 
for the policy, be it further 
Resolved: That the following Information Technology
 Resources Responsible Use Policy be adopted 
and implemented as soon as possible, but no 
later than August 24, 2002, be it further 
Resolved: That the policy be posted to the Univers
ity™s web page, as well as those of the University 
Computing & Telecommunications and Academ
ic Technology units, with conventional 
indexing techniques that include keywords such as ﬁacceptable 
useﬂ to facilitate search and 
retrieval, be it further Resolved: That all departments, colleges and divisions
 be given copies of the policy and encouraged to 
add a link to their web site where appropriate 
so that users of campus technology resources 
will have ready access to the policy, be it finally  [
Resolved: That the Information Technology Board be
 charged with drafting general guidelines to assist 
the campus in implementing and complying with
 this policy and forwarding to the Senate 
those guidelines for Senate appr
oval via the Executive Committee.

 H. Reporting Irresponsible or Inappropriate Use I. Policy Review and Practices Oversight  [A. Scope This policy applies to any user of the University's information technology resources, 
whether initiated from a computer located on 
or off-campus. This includes any computer 
and information system or resource, includ
ing means of access, networks, and the data 
residing thereon. This policy applies to the use of all University information technology 
resources whether centrally-administered or locally-administered. Administrators of 
individual or dedicated University resources may enact additional policies or create 
2 
guidelines specific to those resources provided they do not conflict with the provisions of 
this and other official San José State University policies and laws. Users are subject to 
both the provisions of this policy and any policies specific to the individual systems they 
use.  [In matters in which there is a discrepancy between local unit/or state and federal 
policy and this policy, the issues in dispute will be reviewed by the IT Board or during times where a quorum of the IT Board is 
not available, members of the Executive 
Committee may act for the IT Board. 
B. Purpose This policy is not intended to prevent or prohibit the sanctioned use of campus resources as required to meet SJSU
's core mission and academic and 
administrative purposes. The principal conc
ern of this responsible use policy is the effective and efficient use of information technology resources. The primary 
focus is to insure that the resources are 
used in a manner that does not impair or 
impede the use of these resources by othe
rs in their pursuit of the mission of the 
University. This policy is intended to ensure  [1. the integrity, reliability, and good performance of University resources;  [
2. that the resource-user community operates according to established 

policies and applicable laws;  [
3. that these resources are used for their intended purposes; and  [4. that appropriate measures are in pl
ace to assure the policy is honored. The policy is intended to permit, rather 
than proscribe, reasonable resource-user 
access within institutional priori
ties and financial capabilities.  [
This policy is intended to promote 
and encourage responsible use while minimizing the potential for misuse and not
 imposing broad-based restrictions on 
all users. Users of IT resources should consult the resource provider for any additional guidelines and limitations th
at may be in place for the unit or 
associated organization, eg. Library, Housing, Associated Students, etc.  [ C. Guiding Principles
 The following principles underlie this policy and should guide its application and interpretation: 
1. Freedom of thought, inquiry, and expressi
on is a paramount value of the SJSU 
community. To preserve that freedom, the 
community relies on the integrity and 
responsible use of University resources by each of its members. 
2. The President is ultimately responsible fo
r implementation of this policy, but may 
delegate this responsibility.  [For any policy issue relating to this policy the President should seek consultation with the Academic Senate. 
3 
3. Information technology resources are provi
ded to support the University's mission 
of education, research and service. To
 ensure that these shared and finite resources are used effectively to further the University's mission, each user has 
the responsibility to:  [
a. use the resources appropriately and efficiently;  [
b. respect the freedom and privacy of others;  [

c. protect the stability and secu
rity of the resources; and  [d. understand and fully abide by established University policies and applicable public laws. 
4. Responsible use of University resources will be given priority over the current or potential design, capability or functionality of specific information technology resources including operating systems, ha
rdware, software, and the Internet. 
5. Users of information technology resources
 are expected to uphold the highest academic standards in accordance with the 
Students Rights and Responsibilities Policy (S90-5), Academic Freedom and Professional Responsibilities (S99-8)
, Privacy of Electronic Informa
tion and Communications (F97-7), and other applicable University policies and practices.  [
D. Policy Application  [As a general guideline, the institution regards the principle of academic freedom to be a 
key factor in assuring the effective application of this 
policy and its procedures and practices. State and federal laws must also 
be considered. The University's role in 
supporting or acting to enforce such law is also 
critical to how this policy will be applied.  [
1. All existing laws (
federal, state and local) and State of California, California State University and SJSU regulations and policies apply, including not only laws and regulations that are specific to computers and networks, but also those that may 
apply generally to personal conduct. This may also include laws of other states 
and countries where material is accessed el
ectronically via University resources 
by users within those jurisdictions or material originating within those 
jurisdictions is accessed via University resources. 
2. The accessibility of certain University information technology resources, such as 

network-based services, implies a degree of
 risk that the existence, viewing or 
receipt of such informati
on/content may be offensive.
 As a matter of policy, the 
University protects expression by members of its community and does not wish to 
become an arbiter of what may be rega
rded as "offensive" by some members of 

the community. However, in exceptional 
cases, the University may decide that 
such material directed at 
individuals or classes of individuals presents such a hostile environment under the la
w that certain restrictive actions are warranted.  [3. The University reserves the right to limit access to its resources when policies or 

laws are violated and to us
e appropriate means to safeguard its resources, preserve 
network/system integrity, and ensure conti
nued service delivery at all times. This 
4 
includes monitoring routing information 
of communications across its network services and transaction 
records residing on University resources, scanning systems attached to the SJSU networ
k for security problems, disconnecting 
systems that have become a security
 hazard, and restricting the material 
transported across the network or posted on University systems. This level of 
action is considered one of
 last resort and would be imposed only when other 
means of remedy are unsuccessful or are pr
evented due to timing constraints. If 
possible, the University will 
give notification to the affected units of a shutdown 
and give reasons why the shutdown has occurred.  [These types of actions will be 

reported to the University IT Board each semester for its review. Appeals in 
writing will be considered by the University Information Technology Board or, in 
summer, the Executive Committee of the Senate. 
4. Hyperlinks within the policy to external
 documents are provided for the reference 
and convenience of readers. They should not be viewed as implying that the referenced document is being incorporated
 into this policy except as stated or otherwise specified in the policy itself. 
E. Policy Provisions This section is not intended to provide a full accounting of applicable laws and 

policies. Rather, it is intended to highlight major areas of concern with respect to 
responsible use of SJSU resources and specific issues required by law or CSU policy to be included. 1. Authorized Use / Access Access to SJSU's information technology 
resources is a privilege granted to faculty, staff and students in support of their studies, instruction, duties as employees, official business with the 
University, and/or other University-
sanctioned activities. Access may also be gr
anted to individuals outside of SJSU for purposes consistent with the mission of the University. 
With the exception of implicitly publicly accessible resources such as websites, 
access to SJSU information technology resources may not be transferred or 
extended by members of the University 
community to outside
 individuals or groups without prior approval of faculty, staff or administrator. Such access must 
be limited in nature and fall within the 
scope of the educational mission of the 
institution. The authorizing University official is expected to ensure that such access is not abused. Gaining access to the University's in
formation technology resources does not 
imply the right to use those resources. Th
e University reserves the right to limit, 
restrict, remove or extend access to and 
privileges within, material posted on, or 
communications via its information tec
hnology resources, consistent with this policy, applicable law or as the result of University disciplinary processes, and irrespective of the or
iginating access point. 5 
It is expected that these resources will be used efficiently and responsibly in support of the mission of the University as
 set forth in this policy. All other use not consistent with this policy may be considered unauthorized use.  [
2. Data Security, Confidentiality and Privacy 
 SJSU users are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and appropriate use of institutional data to which they are given access, ensuring the security of the 
equipment where such information is held
 or displayed, ensuring the security of any accounts issued in their name, and ab
iding by related privacy rights of students, faculty and staff concerning the use and release of personal information, 
as required by law or existing policies. Electronic mail and computer files are cons
idered private to the fullest extent 
permitted by law and University policy (
Privacy of Electronic Information and 
Communications Policy (F97-7). Access to such files 
will generally require permission of the sender/recipient of a 
message or the owner of the account in 
which the material resides, court orde
r, or other actions defined by law or University policy. However, in the event of a sanctioned University investigation 

for alleged misconduct, e-mail or files ma
y be locked or copied to prevent 
destruction and loss of information. User
s may employ methods to increase the 
privacy of their files, provided they do not violate any provision of this policy or degrade system/network performance. 
All users of SJSU's information technology 
resources are advised to consider the open nature of information disseminate
d electronically, and should not assume 
any degree of privacy or restricted access to such information. SJSU strives to 
provide the highest degree of security when transferring data, but cannot be held responsible if these measur
es are circumvented and information is intercepted, 
copied, read, forged, destroyed or misused by others. 
3. Electronic Information Retention and Disclosure
 Original electronic materials on central 
computing equipment and/or copies may 
be retained for specified periods of tim
e on system backups and other locations; however the University does not warrant that such information can be retrieved.  [
Unless otherwise required by law and/or policy, SJSU reserves the right to delete stored files and messages to preserve sy
stem integrity. Except in an emergency, 
users will be given ample advance notice, taking the academic year calendar into 
account, to save any personal files and messages. 
Electronic files or messages, whether or
 not created and stored on University resources, may constitute a University record subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act or other laws
, or as a result of litigation. Electronic 
copies must be provided in response to a 
public record request or legally issued subpoena, subject to very limited exceptions
, as with other documents created and 
retained by the University. 6 
Disclosure of confidential information to 
unauthorized persons or entities, or the use of such information for self-interest 
or advantage, is prohibited. Access to non-public institutional data by unauthorized
 persons or entities is prohibited. 
Requests for disclosure of confidential information and retention of potential 
evidence will be honored when approved by authorized University officials or 
required by state or federal law.  [4. Network and System Integrity
 In accordance with 
California State Penal Code Section 502, CSU's 4Cnet 
Acceptable Use Policy and other policies and laws, 
activities and behaviors that threaten the integrity of computer ne
tworks or systems are prohibited on both 
University-owned and privately-owned equipment operated on or through 
University resources. These activities a
nd behaviors include, but are not limited 
to:  [1. Intentional or careless interference with
 or disruption of computer systems 
and networks and related services, including but not limited to the 
propagation of computer "worms," 
"viruses" and "Trojan Horses" and other activities that could have a negative impact on the SJSU computing 
environment in the judgment of the Associate Vice President, University 

Computing and Telecommunications or designee. 
2. Intentionally or carelessly performing 
an act that places an excessive load 
on a computer or network to the exte
nt that other users may be denied 
service or the use of el
ectronic networks or information systems may be 
disrupted  [3. Failure to comply with authorized 
requests from designated University 
officials to discontinue activities that 
threaten the operation or integrity of computers, systems or networks  [
4. Negligently or intentionally reveal
ing passwords or otherwise permitting 
the use by others of University-assigned accounts for computer and 
network access. Individual password s
ecurity is the responsibility of each 
user. The user is responsible for all uses of their accounts, independent of authorization. 5. Altering or attempting to alter files 
or systems without authorization  [
6. Unauthorized scanning of ports, computers and networks  [7. Unauthorized attempts to circumvent
 data protection schemes or uncover 

security vulnerabilities 8. Connecting unauthorized equipment to 
the campus network or computers. 
University authorized business and other activities directly related to the 
academic mission of the University are excluded. 
9. Attempting to alter any University 
computing or network components, 

including but not limited to br
idges, routers, hubs, wiring, and 7 
connections, without authorization or beyond one's level of authorization 
as designated by the administrator res
ponsible for that equipment, ie. the 
Associate Vice President, University Computing and 
Telecommunications, or unit Dean or designee. 
10. Utilizing network or system identification numbers or names that are not 

assigned for one's specific use on the designated system  [
11. Using campus resources to gain una
uthorized access to any computer 
system and/or using someone else's 
computer without their permission  [
12. Providing services or accounts on University computers or via University 
networks to other users from a persona
l computer unless required to meet 
the normal activities of students working 
as individuals or in collaborative groups to fulfill current course requirements. University authorized 
business and other activities directly 
related to the academic mission of the 
University, are also excluded.  [13. Registering a SJSU IP address with any other domain name for other than 
university business.  [5. Commercial Use
 Use of the University's information tec
hnology resources is strictly prohibited for unauthorized commercial activities, personal gain, and private, or otherwise unrelated to the University, business or fundraising. This includes soliciting, promoting, selling, marketing or advertisi
ng products or services, or reselling University resources.  [Campus auxiliary organizations are authori
zed to provide services and products to students, faculty and staff, and invited guests of the University through operating 
and service support leases. The University President or designee may authorize 
additional limited commercial uses under 
separate policy provisions. Such uses are excepted from the above prohibitions. 
These prohibitions are not intended to infringe on authorized uses that enable students, staff and faculty to carry out their duties and assignments in support of the University mission. 
6. Fraud Use of University information technology 
resources for purposes of perpetrating fraud in any form is strictly prohibite
d. Fraudulent activities include but are not limited to sending any fraudulent electronic
 transmission, fraudulent requests for 
confidential information and fraudulent 
submission and/or authorization of 
electronic purchase requisitions.  [7. Political Campaigns:
 California Government Code 8314 prohibits 
the use of state resources for major 
political campaign activity.  [This provision does not apply to political activities related to on-campus student government, including the conduct of student 

elections, or student club activities and sponsored events conducted with prior 8 
approval of the University. It does not apply to individual student activities, e.g., websites, which constitute free speech. It does not apply to incidental and minimal 
use of state resources.  [Such activities mu
st comply with all other provisions of 
this policy, including the section on electronic communicatio
ns, when using University resources. 8. Harassment
 Harassment of others via electr
onic methods is prohibited under 
California State Penal Code Section 653m, other applicable laws and University policies. It is a violation of this policy to use electronic means to harass, threaten, or otherwise 

cause harm to a specific individual(s), whet
her by direct or indirect reference. It 
may be a violation of this policy to use 
electronic means to harass or threaten 
groups of individuals by creating a hostile environment.  [
9. Copyright and Fair Use Federal copyright law applies to all forms of in
formation, including electronic 
communications, and violations are prohibited under this policy. Infringements of 
copyright laws include, but are not limite
d to, making unauthorized copies of any 
copyrighted material (incl
uding software, computer code, text, images, audio, and 
video), and displaying or distributing copyrighted materials over computer 
networks without the author's permissi
on except as provided in limited form by 
copyright fair use restrictions. The "fai
r use" provision of the copyright law allows for limited reproduction and di
stribution of published works without permission for such purposes as critic
ism, news reporting, teaching (including 
multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research. The University will 

not tolerate academic dishonesty (s98-1)
 or theft of intell
ectual property in any form.  [
10. Trademarks and Patents 
 Student, faculty and staff use of Univer
sity information technology resources in 
the creation of inventions and other intellectual property that may be patented, 
trademarked or licensed for commercial pur
poses must be consistent with SJSU's 
Intellectual Property Policy (F98-3). Unauthorized use of patents, trade secrets and trademarked names or symbols is 
prohibited. Use of SJSU's name and 
symbols must comply with University policy.  [
11. Electronic Communications
 University electronic communications are to
 be used to enhance and facilitate teaching, learning, scholarly research, support 
academic experiences, to facilitate 
the effective business and administrative processes of the University, and to foster 

effective communications within the acad
emic community. Electronic mail, news 
posts, chat sessions or any other form of electronic communication must comply 
with SJSU's Privacy of Electronic Informati
on and Communications Policy (F97-7).  [ 9 
12. Web Sites
 An official SJSU web page is one that is formally acknowledged by the chief 
officer of a University department or 
division as representing that entity 
accurately and in a manner consistent
 with SJSU's mission. Without such 
acknowledgment, a web site, regardless of cont
ent, is not "official." Official pages are the property and responsibility of the divisions that create them and follow the 
University Web Style Guide and University Logo Guidelines
  ["Unofficial" information may also be 
posted and maintained by individual 
students, faculty, staff and student organizations. SJSU does not undertake to edit, screen, monitor, or censor information 
posted by unofficial authors, whether or not originated by unofficial authors or 
third parties, and does not accept any 
responsibility or liability for such information even when it is conveyed through 
University-owned servers.  [
Both official and unofficial web sites are subject to the other provisions of this policy if they use University resources such as University-owned servers and the 
SJSU network to transmit and receive information. 
F. Policy Compliance The University Information Technology Board is
 authorized by the President to ensure that the appropriate processes to administer the policy ar
e in place, communicated and 
followed by the University community. The President or designee will ensure that 
suspected violations and resultant actions receive the proper and immediate attention of 
the appropriate University officials, 
law enforcement, outside agencies, and 
disciplinary/grievance processes in accordance with due process. The President or designee will inform users about the policy; receive and respond to 

complaints; collect and secure evidence as requi
red; advise and assist University offices on the interpretation, investigation and enforcement of th
is policy; consult with University Legal Counsel on matters involving 
interpretation of law, campus policy, or requests from outside law enforcement agencies and/or legal counsel; and maintain a 
record of each incident and its resolution to inform future policy changes. G. Consequences of Non-Compliance Enforcement will be based upon receipt by University Computing and 

Telecommunications of one or more formal
 complaints about a specific incident 
or through discovery of a possible violation in the normal course of administering 
information technology resources.  [
First offense and minor infractions of
 this policy, when accidental or unintentional, such as consuming excessi
ve resources or overloading computer systems, are generally resolved informa
lly by the unit administering the resource. 
This may be done through e-mail or 
in-person discussion and education. Repeated offenses and serious incidents of non-compliance may lead to University 
disciplinary action under CSU and University disciplinary policies and procedures for 10 
students and employees, employee contract pr
ovisions where appropriate, private civil 
action, and/or criminal charges. Serious in
cidents of non-compliance include but are not limited to unauthorized use of computer res
ources, attempts to stea
l passwords or data, 
unauthorized use or copying of licensed software, repeated harassment, or threatening 
behavior.  [In addition to the above, inappropriate use of information technology resources may 
result in personal criminal, civ
il and other administrative liability. 
Appeals of University actions resulting from
 enforcement of this policy will be handled 
through existing disciplinary/grievance processes for SJSU students and employees. H. Reporting Irresponsible or Inappropriate Use
 The President or designee is responsible for 
reviewing violations of this policy and will act in accordance with campus policies and guide
lines for investigations and resolution of 
problems.  [Suspected infractions of this

Data Access Policy
 Audience:
 All faculty, staff and students All benefit eligible employees (regular) and temporary All 
contractors, vendors and any others (including 3rd parties) entrusted with information 
maintained in the University™s information repositories
 Definition:
 Protecting
 information assets is driven by a variety of considerations including legal, 
academic, financial and other business requirements.
 Northwestern University is committed to nurturing the open, information
-sharing 
requirements of its academic culture, while p
reserving the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of its information resources. To promote the highest standards of decision
-making and management, Northwestern University intends to provide the University 
community expeditious access to authoritat
ive and accurate data from information 
systems.
 The policy contained in this document will support and promote greater understanding 
of and appropriate use of data, and heightened awareness of the sensitive nature of 
data based on various risk factors. It 
is expected that this policy will improve the ability 
of the University community to properly manage access to University data in compliance 
with Federal and State laws and regulations, and other University policy requirements. 
Overall the policy will impr
ove data quality and the transparency of institutional security 
and trust policies.
 Policy Statement:
 Access to data will be as broad as possible, consistent with the classification of the data, role(s) 
and responsibilities of the user, and level of traini
ng. Data will be classified according to its 
sensitivity to unauthorized exposure as per the standards defined in this document. This policy 
will be supported by ongoing development of a Data Access Matrix (with data classifications and 

data access roles),
 and a program which will train users to effectively and securely use 
University data.
 Scope
 
Items of information that are created, collected, maintained, and utilized by the University 
community for the purpose of carrying out the institutional mission of
 research and teaching and 
data used in the execution of required business functions, limited by any overriding contractual 

or statutory regulations. Research data, scholarly work of faculty or students, and intellectual 
property are beyond the scope of th
is policy.
 Policy Owners
 Policy owners are the Provost and Senior Vice President for Business and Finance. The 

Administrative Data Council (ADC) is involved in governance of the policy.
 Standards for Data Classification
 University data must be consistently
 protected throughout its life cycle in a manner 
commensurate with its sensitivity and criticality, regardless of where it resides or what 
purpose(s) it serves. For example, extracts of data and backups of data shall have the same 

classification level and 
utilize the same protective measures as the same data in the system of 
record.
 1. Public Information
 Public:
 Public information is available to all members of the University community, 
and may be released to the general public. The University reserves the rig
ht to control the 
content and format of Public information. This information is not restricted by local, 
state, national, or international statute regarding disclosure or use.
 Examples include the University™s auditable financials, schedule of classes, and
 approved 
census facts.
 2. Internal Information
 Internal:
 Information that is intended for use by and made available to members of the 
University community who have a business need to know. This information is not 
restricted by local, state, national, or inte
rnational statute regarding disclosure or use. 
Internal information is not intended for public dissemination but may be released to 

external parties to the extent there is a legitimate business need. The University reserves 

the right to control the content
 and format of Internal information when it is published to 
external parties.
 Examples include employment data, financial expenditure detail, Course Teacher 
Evaluations, and Directory Information.
 Recognizing that inappropriate disclosure of certain Intern
al information may result in 
unauthorized use of the data, the University reserves the right to designate that certain 

subsets of Internal information require training in the appropriate use and handling of the 
data, e.g., salary letters.
 3. Legally/Contractu
ally Restricted Information
 Legally/Contractually Restricted:
 Information that is required to be protected 
by applicable law or statute (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, or the Illinois Personal Information 
Protection Act), or which, if disclosed to the public could ex
pose the University to legal 
or financial obligations.
 Access is granted to those individuals who have a business need to know and who have 

signed an appropriate confidentiality agreement.
 Examples include, but are not limited to, occurrences of personally
-identifiable 
information, e.g., social security numbers (SSNs), personnel records, student records, 
medical records, names in connection with SSNs, and credit card numbers. Specific 

Univer
sity policies may apply to particular data in this classification, e.g., Secure 
Handling of Social Security Numbers, Security of Electronic Protected Health 
Information, etc.
 Recognizing that unauthorized use of certain Restricted information may expose th
e University to particularly heightened risk, the University reserves the right to designate 
that users be required to undergo additional training as appropriate.
 4. Procedure
 A wider group of systems, business units, and individuals must have informed data 
access and shared responsibility for use of that data. As part of this shared responsibility, 
individual units are responsible for the development and implementation of procedures to 
effectuate this policy.
 Additional clarifications to the policy may be pro
vided and will be communicated when 
circumstances require.
 5. Compliance
 The classification level applied to specific information is based on statutory requirements, 
the sensitivity of the data, its criticality to the University, and its use. Individuals foun
d in 
violation of policy are subject to consequences as documented in the Faculty, Staff, and 

Student Handbooks, the Standards of Business Conduct, and via contractual agreements 
with third parties doing business with the University.

Many policies are quite lengthy. Please check the page count before deciding 
whether to print.
 
Scope
 
This policy applies 
to all users of Indiana University information technology resources 
regardless of affiliation, and irrespective of whether those resources are accessed from 
on
-
campus or off
-
campus locations.
 
Back to top
 
Policy Statement
 
Unless otherwise specified in this policy or other university policies, use of Indiana 
University information technology resources is restricted to purposes related to the 
university'
s mission of research and creative activity, teaching and learning, and civic 
engagement. Eligible individuals are provided access in order to support their studies, 

instruction, duties as employees, official business with the university, and other 
univers
ity
-
sanctioned activities. Individuals may not share with or transfer to others their 
university accounts including network IDs, passwords, or other access codes that allow 
them to gain access to university information technology resources.
 
Indiana Univers
ity technology resources may not be used in a manner that violates the 
law, for private commercial activities that are not approved by the university, for 
personal private gain, or for political campaigning and similar activities that are 
inconsistent with
 
the university's tax
-
exempt status.
 
Campuses, schools, colleges, departments, and other administrative units have 
considerable latitude in developing complementary technology use policies and 
procedures, as long as they are consistent with this policy and
 
any other applicable 
technology use policies of the university. Such policies may be more restrictive than 
university policy, but must not be more permissive.
 
Incidental personal use is an accepted and appropriate benefit of being associated with 
Indiana 
University's rich technology environment. Appropriate incidental personal use of 
technology resources does not result in any measurable cost to the university, and 
benefits the university by allowing personnel to avoid needless inconvenience. 
Incidental pe
rsonal use must adhere to all applicable university policies. Under no 
circumstances may incidental personal use involve violations of the law, interfere with 
the fulfillment of an employee's university responsibilities, or adversely impact or conflict 
wit
h activities supporting the mission of the university.
 
Back to top
 
Reason for Policy
 
Computers, network systems, and other technologies offer powerf
ul tools for creating, 
communicating, and managing data, and for a host of other activities. Taxpayers, 
students, and other groups providing sources of funding that support information 
technology resources at Indiana University expect that these assets wil
l be used in 
support of the university's mission of research and creative activity, teaching and 
learning, and civic engagement. In addition, the university and its constituents expect 
that information technology resources at Indiana University will be use
d in a lawful 
manner.
 
Back to top
 
Procedures
 
Determination of relation to mission
 
If the relationship of a use of information technology resources t
o the university's 
mission is unclear, the University Information Policy Office (UIPO) or regional 
campus Chief Information Officers (CIOs) will coordinate with campus 

administration and the unit involved. These groups will determine whether the 
activity i
s an appropriate use of university information technology resources and 
supports the mission of the university.
 
Determination of incidental personal use
 
The senior management of each university department or other administrative 
unit is authorized to defin
e and publish the acceptable level and nature of 
incidental personal use by members of the unit. An employee's supervisor may 
require the employee to cease or limit any incidental personal use that hampers 
job performance or violates university policy. Uni
versity technology service 
providers will always place a higher priority on support of university
-
related 
activities over any form of incidental personal use.
 
Consultation
 
The University Information Policy Office (UIPO) and/or regional Chief Information 
Of
ficers (CIOs) are available to provide consultation or advice related to 
technology use or misuse to any university, campus, or unit administrators or 
individual personnel.

Definitions
 
Commercial activities
 
are defined as economic activities geared toward a mass or specialized market 
and ordinarily intended to
 
result in a profit, and that are not part of one's 
university responsibilities. Commercial activities do not include the use of 
information technology resources for one
-
time, minimal transactions, such as 
students using their Indiana University email acco
unts to communicate with 
potential buyers for used textbooks or with potential sub
-
lessees. This type of 
transaction is considered incidental personal use.
 
Incidental personal use
 
is the use of information technology resources by members of the Indiana 
Uni
versity community in support of activities that do not relate to their university 
employment or studies or to other activities involving and approved by the 
university. Examples include use of email to send personal messages to friends, 
family, or colleagu
es, including messages relating to one
-
time minimal sales or 
purchase transactions, and use of the personal home page service to provide 
information about personal hobbies or interests. If personal use adversely affects 
or conflicts with university operati
ons or activities, the user will be asked to cease 
those activities. All direct costs (for example, printer or copier paper and other 
supplies) attributed to personal incidental use must be assumed by the user.
 
Information technology resources
 
includes all
 
university
-
owned computers, peripherals, and related equipment and 
software; voice communications infrastructure, peripherals, and related 
equipment and software; data communications infrastructure, peripherals, and 
related equipment and software; all oth
er associated tools, instruments, and 
facilities; and the services that make use of any of these technology resources. 
The components may be individually controlled (i.e., assigned to an employee) or 

shared in a single
-
user or multi
-
user manner; they may b
e stand
-
alone or 
networked; and they may be stationary or mobile.
 
Personal private gain
 
is defined as securing profit or reward for an individual in his or her personal 
capacity, that is not otherwise permitted by this policy.
 
Political campaigning and sim
ilar activities that are inconsistent with the university's tax
-
exempt status
 
include campaign purposes that would further the interests of the candidate or 
candidates of any one political party.
 
Regional campus Chief Information Officer
 
The primary respon
sibility of a regional campus Chief Information Officer is the 
development and use of information technology in support of the campus's vision 
for excellence in research, teaching, outreach, and lifelong learning. He or she 
also is responsible for dissemin
ating information to the campus, coordinating 
activities that involve more than one campus, fostering cooperation in areas such 
as sharing technical expertise and training, and coordinating response and 
resolution of problems on their own campus involving 
information technology 
issues.
 
University Chief Information Officer
 
The primary responsibility of the University Chief Information Officer is the 
development and use of information technology in support of the university's 
vision for excellence in research
, teaching, outreach, and lifelong learning. The 
University Information Policy Office (UIPO) represents the University Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) with respect to policy issues related to the IU 
Bloomington and IUPUI campuses.

Interim Electronic Communications Implementing Guidelines 5612 
Supercedes Electronic Mail Implementing Guidelines Issued July 1, 1998 
Interim guidelines effective December 28, 2000 
 
Pages 6  [Interim Electronic Communications Implementing Guidelines 5612  [
Background  [Effective November 17, 2000 the University of California adopted the University Electronic 
Communications Policy.  [The new policy superseded the 1998 University Electronic Mail Policy 
and Business and Finance Bulletin IS-6, Campus Communications Guidelines. 
 The University Office of the President has asked UC campuses to use their Electronic 
Mail Implementing Guidelines as interim Electronic Communications Implementing 
Guidelines.  [Therefore, effective December 28, 2000 the principles and processes 
contained in these Guidelines shall be applied to electronic communications.  [If you have 

any questions about applying the Guidelines to electronic communications please 

contact Policy Coordinator Meta Clow at <Meta.Clow@vcadmin.ucsb.edu>. 
 The Policy and Implementing Guidelines were carefully written to assure the principles of 
academic freedom, freedom of speech, and privacy of information are upheld.  [Their intent is to 
engender an environment which encourages the use of electronic communications and other 
resources which may be critical to the pursuit of teaching, research, public service, learning, 
and delivery of services.  [At the same time, the Policy and Guidelines recognize that the 
University is also charged with protecting its members and meeting legal and fiduciary 
obligations.  [ 
 Scope  [The Policy and Guidelines apply to: 
 All electronic communications resources owned or managed by the University; All electronic communications resources provided by the University through contracts and 
other agreements with the University; All users and uses of University electronic communications resources; and All University electronic communication records in the possession of University employees or of other users of electronic communications resources provided by the University.  [The Guidelines  [The Interim Implementing Guidelines (1) emphasize that the University respects the privacy of electronic communications users; and (2) outline a process which (a) assures that the least 
perusal of contents, and the least action necessary is taken to resolve issues involving 
monitoring, inspection, and disclosure of electronic communications, and (b) assures that the 
individual is promptly notified of any action being taken and of the procedures for recourse.  [The 
proposed Guidelines are sensitive to and respond to concerns raised about the Policy. 
 
The Policy is restated in some of the sections within the Guidelines.  [The intention is to aid 
supervisors and general users by providing them, in brief terms, with the general principle 
represented in the Policy.  [  [1 of 6

 II. Allowable Use 
 A. To Support the University Mission 
Electronic communications services are provided to University of California, Santa Barbara employees and its agents for the purpose of teaching, research, 
and conducting university business.  [In general, electronic communications 
should be used with the same discretion as all other university resources, 
carefully assuring that its use is to benefit the University and is not for personal 
benefit or gain.  [Electronic communications traveling to or from a university 
employee or agent, or through campus networks, is to be for lawful purposes 
only and consistent with other university policies.  [B. Incidental Personal Use 
University communications services may be used for incidental personal use consistent with the provisions of the Electronic Communications Policy under, 
"Allowable Use."  [Incidental use is limited to electronic communications sent on 
behalf of an individual; systematically
 sending electronic communications on behalf of an organization outside the University (not-for-profit or for-profit) would 
transgress UC policy.  [As an example, Sally may send a short electronic note 
inviting Julia to a fund-raiser at the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.  [She 
is not to use University electronic communications services to send a number of 
people a note promoting the event on behalf of the Santa Barbara Natural History 
Museum, nor is she to use her electronic address as a r.s.v.p. or point of contact 
for the event (or for other activities not affiliated with the University).  [C.  [Concerns About Use 
Every electronic communications user (for definition, see Electronic Communications Policy, Appendix A) is responsible for reading and abiding by 
the Electronic Communications Policy and the Interim Implementing Guidelines.  [
Each supervisor is charged with resolving concerns about electronic 
communications use/misuse within his/her jurisdiction.  [For students, concerns 
may be registered with the supervisor of the unit through which email services 
are provided.  [As appropriate, the supervisor may redirect unresolved concerns 
to the next higher authority within his/her organization, consistent with 
procedures for handling other complaints or grievances.  [

Policy or Guideline clarification may be obtained from the Campus Policy Coordinator, Office of the Vice Chancellor, Administrative Services, currently 
Meta.Clow@vcadmin.ucsb.edu.  [III.  [Access  [
 Access to University electronic communications services may be provided to faculty and staff by the department with whom they are affiliated through a mail service provider.  [Students may be provided access to electronic communications by their departments, 
college, library, residence, or directly by a campus electronic communications services provider (Microcomputer Laboratory, and/or Information Systems and Computing).  [IV. Notification 
 A. Faculty and Staff 
If the responsible department administrator decides to provide new faculty and staff with access to electronic communications services, she/he is to assure that 
the new faculty/staff is provided with a copy of The University Electronic 
communications Policy and Implementing Guidelines, or the web address for the 
Policy and Guidelines with sufficient instruction to access them on-line. 
 
Department administrators, or their designees, are to inform all of their faculty 
and staff that using electronic communications services implies that the user (a) 
has read and understood the Policy and Guidelines, and (b) acknowledges that 
usage which does not comply with the policy or guidelines may result in 
sanctions as defined within the policy.  [Management and Administrative Officers 
may wish to include this policy requirement in their department’s new employee 
orientation packets/check off procedures and annotate the date when the new 
employee has been notified.  [Department administrators or their designees are to 
inform their faculty and staff of the department’s electronic communications 
service provider’s mail/files back-up practices.  [Electronic communications 
service providers are to describe their back-up practices to the departments they 
serve.  [B. Students Students are to receive from the unit or electronic communications service provider with whom they contract, at the time they sign their service contract, (1) 
a copy of the Policy and Guidelines, or (2) the web address and instruction for 
accessing the Policy and Guidelines on-line.  [The mail services provider shall 
add language to the service contract which states:  ["Use of electronic 
communications services implies acknowledgment that you will use the services 
consistent with the University Electronic communications Policy and Campus 
Implementing Guidelines, and that usage which does not comply with the policy 
or guidelines may result in sanctions as defined within the policy."  [Also, the mail 
services provider is to send a note to all existing student clients which states:  [
"Continued use of electronic communications services implies acknowledgment 
that you will use the services consistent with the University Electronic 
communications Policy and Campus Implementing Guidelines, and that usage 
which does not comply with the policy or guidelines may result in sanctions as 
defined within the policy."  [Students shall also be informed of their mail provider’s 
mail/files back-up practices when they sign their contracts for services.  [V. Directory Information 
 A. Faculty and Staff 
Faculty and staff electronic communications addresses may be published in the campus directory.  [The campus directory is intended for university business 3 of 6
purposes.  [However, addresses may become known from electronic contexts viewed outside of the University if messages containing addresses are posted to 
public news groups, listservers, web pages, etc.  [B. Students Student electronic communications addresses may be published unless the student requests that his/her address be withheld.  [Campus electronic 
communications providers to students may provide an alternate (electronic 
pseudonym) address.  [However, providers shall caution students that their 
addresses still may become known from electronic contexts viewed outside of 
the University if the students' messages that contain their addresses are posted 
to public news groups, listservers, web pages, etc. 
 VI.  [End of Affiliation 
 As with other university resources such as telephones and mail, when a faculty, student, 
or staff member leaves the department or University, the department (or for students, the 
mail services provider) may stop providing electronic communications services to the 
individual.  [The department may choose, where available, to provide electronic 
forwarding/redirecting of mail to another address.  [If the department continues to provide 
access to university electronic communications services, use must conform to the 
University Electronic communications Policy and Campus Guidelines.  [VII. Service Restrictions 
 A. Electronic communications service providers are responsible for protecting and 
maintaining the integrity of the email system.  [The Email Service Manager, the 
person who has administrative responsibility for an electronic communications 
system, is charged with taking the necessary actions, including restricting or 
refusing email services, to prevent, to the extent possible, disruption of email 
services and damage to users of email.  [ B. Email services also may be suspended or restricted by the email user’s

and public service require that the privilege of the use of computing systems and software,
internal and external data networks, as well as access to the World Wide Web, be made
available to all members of the SUNY community. The preservation of that privilege for the full
community requires that each faculty member, sta
" member, student, and other authorized
user comply with institutional and external standards for appropriate use.
To assist and ensure such compliance, the University at Bu

  [The 
Office of the Chief Information Officer
  [
(A)
 Policy Statement and Purpose
  [ITS will only
 issue email accounts to individuals that meet the eligibility 
requirements. ITS will only issue one personal email account to each 

eligible individual.
  [
ITS is responsible for issuing official BGSU email accounts. ITS has
 established eligibility requirements for email accounts to manage and 

secure the computing environment. By limiting account privileges to 

people that meet the eligibility requirements, ITS is better able to allocate 

resources to individuals actively worki
ng on 
university projects. ITS is 
also better able to identify and locate people that have misused computing 

facilities.
  [(B)
 Policy
  [An individual must have 
a current affiliation with the u
niversity. 
Affiliations include u
niversity employees (faculty and 
staff), currently 
enrolled students, retirees, Alumni and guests. Guest account requests are 

evaluated by ITS on a case
-by-case basis.
  [
An individual must acquire a BGSU authentication account prior to 

requesting other server accounts.
 
 
An individual must 
agree to abide by the policies and re
sponsibilities 

outlined in the u
niversity™s Acceptable Use Policy
.  [
(1)
 Email Addresses
 
3341-6-6  [2  [ITS 
has rules and standards for email usernames and the 
corresponding email addresses.
  [(a)
 Background
  [
Individuals can acquire an email account upon 
meeting 

university affiliation requirements. When registering for an 

email account, the client must choose a username. This 

username will be used for all server accounts (including 

email) that the individual re
quests throughout his or her 
affiliation with 
the u
niversity.
  [
Different server systems have different username 

requirements. Due to the broad use of this username, ITS 

has established rules and standards for usernames to meet 

the requirements of the vario
us u
niversity server systems.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
Individuals requesting an email account will choose from a 

list of available usernames. These usernames will be 

derived from the client™s first, middle, and last names. The 

requestor must select a username from the c
hoices 

provided. ITS will not accommodate requests for special or 

ﬁvanityﬂ usernames.
  [
Usernames will not be available for selection by new 

subscribers until the previous owner™s email account has 

been deleted for at least three months. This is done to hel
p avoid confusion when messages meant for the original 

owner of the username are sent to the new owner.
  [
If a client leaves the university for an extended period and 

his or her account is terminated, ITS cannot guarantee that 

the account username will be a
vailable if that client returns 

to the university at a later date.
  [(2)
 Username Changes
  [
3341-6-6  [3  [ITS will only change a client™s username when a client has legally 
changed their name. This also changes the client™s username for 

other server accounts.
  [
(a)
 Background
  [
As part of the email account acquisition process, a client is 

required to choose a single unique username from a list of 

available options derived from their first, middle and last 

names. This unique username is then used as the account 

name for every serv
er account provided to the client. To 
minimize administrative overhead and to assure accurate 

record keeping, ITS has established strict rules for initiating 

a username change.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
ITS will accept requests for changing a client™s username if 

the clie
nt presents ITS with proof of a legal name change. 
The client should have their name changed on the 

Administrative Computer Systems (Human Resources 

and/or Student Information System) before requesting a 

username change. ITS will then process the username 

change and change all server account names assigned to 

that client.
  [
ITS cannot change an individual™s name on the 

Administrative Computer Systems. The client must make 

this request through Registration and Records
  [(3)
 Office Accounts
  [
Departments and offices
 can obtain office email accounts for 
business correspondence. Multiple individuals within the 

department can access these accounts to process the incoming 

mail.
  [
(a)
 Background 
  [
The u
niversity provides email as a tool for conducting the 
business of 
departments, academic offices
, and ultimately 

3341-6-6  [4  [the u
niversity. Office accounts are intended to streamline 
the operations of departments and offices by providing 
accounts for group use. These accounts allow multiple 

individuals within a department to access 
and respond to 

incoming mail. These office accounts also allow the 

departments to advertise an email address that corresponds 

to a department or function, rather than an individual. 

These accounts are intended to minimize the impact of 

staffing changes and
 absences and eliminate the need for 
one person to access another individ
ual™s email account to 

perform u
niversity business.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
Offices and Departments can obtain office email accounts 

by submitting a request to the ITS Technology Support 

Center. Th
e requesting office or department will need to 
choose a name for the
 account (preferably eight to twelve
 characters long) that is not already in use.
  [
Office accounts have the same restrictions and quotas as 

faculty and staff email accounts and can be acce
ssed 

through Webmail and other POP and IMAP mail clients.
 
 
ITS has the right to limit the number of office accounts 

granted to a department or office.
  [(4)
 Email Forwarding
  [
The owner of a BGSU E
-mail account can have the account 
forwarded to an email address 
outside of the BGSU domain.
 
 
(a)
 Background
  [
Clients must register for a BGSU E
-mail account to acquire 
other server accounts. ITS recognizes that many individuals 

already have ema
il accounts when they join the u
niversity 

community. To simplify management of i
ndividual™s email 

accounts, ITS allows BGSU E
-Mail accounts to be 
forwarded to an email address outside the BGSU domain.
 
 
3341-6-6  [5  [(b)
 Details
  [ITS will not allow email to be forwarded from an 
individual™s BGSU E
-Mail address to another individual™s 
BGSU email address.
  [
ITS will immediately remove any forward that is suspected 

of creating an email routing loop or other delivery 

problems.
 
 (5)
 Quotas on attachments
  [
ITS will establish and enforce quotas on email attachment size 

provided to account holders. W
hen an attachment
 is over its 
twenty
-five
 Meg size, the email will not be delivered.
  [(6)
 Email Blocking
  [
ITS reserves the right to block any incoming email messages that 

might cause email server problems, problems for the em
ail users, 
or problems for the u
niversity™s network.
  [
(a)
 Background 
  [
Email can be used to transport virus
-infected files or 
programs that can disrupt the email servers and the email 

user community. Email can also be used to broadly deliver 

information that is inappropriate or a nuisance (unsolicited 

bulk emai
l, also kn
own as ﬁspam.ﬂ) To protect the 
university community
 and u
niversity resources from such 
threats, ITS may block specific message
s, senders or 
domains from the u
niversity™s domain. These blocks may 

be set on a temporary or permanent basis depending 
on the 

nature of the threat.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
ITS may use anti
-virus software to automatically block 
messages that appear to be infected by a virus.
  [
3341-6-6  [6  [ITS may use ﬁblack
-holeﬂ lists to protect against known 
email abusers and sites with open relays. At times, 
legitimate senders may be blocked if they are sending from 

a site that has left itself open to abuse because of weak 

security.
  [
ITS may manually set blocks on specific senders or 

domains when they are suspected of sending messages that 

are deemed inappropr
iate or a threat to our environment.
  [
ITS will set size limits for email messages. The current 

maximum
 size for a single message is ten
 megabytes. 
Limiting the size of messages keeps individual accounts 

from exceeding
 their quotas and protects the u
niversi
ty 
network from excessive traffic. Email messages that exceed 

the size limit will be blocked from entering the email 

server.
  [
Email messages must properly identify the sender. Email 

messages that are found to not properly identify the sender 

will be blocke
d from entering the email server.
  [(7)
 Account Access
  [
ITS reserves the right to restrict email server access methods to 

those appropriate for the intended use of a server. For security 

reasons, these methods are generally restricted to the lowest level 

of acc
ess needed to perform the intended functions of the server.
  [
(a)
 Background
  [
ITS 
is responsible for securing the u
niversity™s email 
environment. ITS evaluates the intended use of a server in 

conjunction with the security risks introduced by various 

account 
access methods to establish the best account access 
policy. In general, the least access necessary to provide the 

necessary services will be granted.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
3341-6-6  [7  [Email accounts can only be accessed with email software 
that follows Post Office Protocol (POP) 
or Internet 

Message Access Protocol (IMAP). Clients can use the ITS
-provided Webmail interface to access their accounts, which 

uses the IMAP protocol to access the servers. 
  [(8)
 Client Responsibilities 
  [
Account holders have responsibilities that must be met 
as part of 

the privilege of email access. Account holders are expected to live 

up to these responsibilities or lose their access privileges
.  [
(a)
 Background
  [
The email server environment is a shared environment. 

Since the account holders are a diverse group, 
and sin
ce email access is critical to u
niversity business, it is essential 
that each account holder use the servers responsibly.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
An account holder is responsible for the use of his or her 

email account, and may not give anyone else access to that
 account. Conversely, account holders may not, in any way, 

try to obtain access any account other than their own.
 
 
An account holder is responsible for the security of his or 

her account password. This includes changing that 

password on a regular basis and
 ensuring that no one else 
knows it. It is also the account holder™s responsibility to 

remember passwords that they set for their accounts.
  [
An account holder may not deliberately perform acts that 

will disrupt the normal operation or diminish the 

performa
nce of the network, se
rvers, or other devices on 
the u
niversity network.
  [
An account holder must abide by the terms of all software 

licensing agreements and copyright laws.
  [
3341-6-6  [8  [An account holder must abide by the rules established for 
the server where the acc
ount is housed. The account holder 
must follow all rules regarding quotas, server access 

methods, usage restrictions, etc.
 
 
An account holder must adhere to the responsibilities and 

policies dictated in Bowling Green State University's 

Acceptable Use Polic
y.  [(9)
 Account Termination
 
 
BGSU accounts will be administratively disabled and deleted 

within an established time interval after the account holder is
 no 
longer affiliated with the u
niversity.
  [
(a)
 Background
  [
Information Technology Services has responsibil
ity 
for 
managing access to the u
niversity's centrally controlled 

servers and services.  [Account termination policies have 

been established in order to enhance the security and 

reliability of these systems, and to allow for system 

resource planning and growth t
o meet the evolving needs of 
the u
niversity community.  [By limiting account privileges 
to users who have 
an active affiliation with the u
niversity, 
ITS can focus the resources and support toward the proper 

subscriber group and allow current and prospective
 students, faculty, and staff to get priority service.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
Accounts held by individuals who vi
olate u
niversity 
policies, policies established in the BGSU Information 

Technology Policy, or any ITS established policies will be 

immediately eligible to h
ave their accounts administratively 
locked without prior notice.
  [
Accounts held by student applicants who have failed to 

enroll and register for the term in which they were accepted 

for admission will be eligible for deletion the following 

term.
 
3341-6-6  [9  [ Accounts 
held by faculty and staff will be eligible for 
deletion 
ninety
 days after their resignation or termination, 
however retirees of BGSU are eligible to retain their email 

accounts indefinitely. Accounts of terminated employees 

may be administ
ratively locked p
rior to the ninety 
day 
timeframe at the request of u
niversity administration or the 
management of the contracting department, area or unit.  [

Faculty and staff must make arrangements pri
or to their 
departure from the u
niversity to publicize a new email 

addr
ess as appropriate.
  [
Accounts granted to non
-affiliated individuals (campus 
ministers, visiting scholars, adjunct (intermittent) faculty, 

external faculty, consultants, contractors, participants in 

Continuing Education courses or programs, etc.) will be 

considered eligible for deletion twenty
-four
 months after 
their accounts are created.  [Individuals in this category who 

have a continuing role at the university can contact the 

Technology Support Center (TSC) when notified of their 

deletion eligibility to be
 put into contact with their 
sponsoring department, area or u
nit to request an additional 

twenty
-four 
month extension of their access.  [ 
  [
Accounts are eligible fo
r deletion two weeks after the 
university has been notified that an account holder is 

deceased.  [Account privacy policies apply to all accounts, 

even after an account holder's death.
  [
Accounts may be deleted at ITS discretion any time after 

they become eligible.  [A delay in the deletion process does 

not imply a right of the account holder 
to extended access 

to their accounts. Account holders can have their accounts 

deleted earlier than scheduled by placing a request through 

the Technology Support Center
.  [(10)
 Account Privacy
  [
ITS will honor the account holder™s right to privacy. As necessary 

for email administration, ITS reserves the right to examine, log, 

3341-6-6  [10  [capture, archive, inspect, and prese
rve any messages stored on the 
university central servers.
  [(a)
 Background
  [
ITS 
is responsible f
or managing and supporting the 
university email servers. This re
sponsibility requires ITS to 
investigate and analyze server performance and security 

issues. At times, these efforts require ITS personnel to 

examine, log, capture, archive, inspect, and preserve 

messages in client accounts. ITS will honor the account 

hold
er™s right to privacy except in cases where there are 

security violations, policy violations, and/or violations of 

the law.
  [(b)
 Details
  [
Individuals eighteen
 years of age or older are considered to 
be adults in the State of Ohio and are therefore responsible 

for their own actions. ITS cannot honor requests from the 

parents of these individuals to release email account 

information or terminate email privileges for these 

individuals.
  [
ITS employees are required to protect the account holder™s 

right to privacy 
based on the confidentiality rules in the ITS 

Code of Ethics. Any violation by ITS employees of this 

code of ethics is considered grounds for dismissal.
  [
Any email account that is associated with or suspected of 

being associated with security violations, p
olicy violations, 

and/or violations of the law may be examined, logged, 

captured, archived, inspected, or preserved as part of a 

formal investigation. Any account found to be in v
iolation 

may be turned over to u
niversity officials, law enforcement 

official
s, officials of the court, or other officials engaged in 
an investigation
.  [(11)
 Public Records
  [
3341-6-6  [11  [Email correspondence that relates to the organization, functions, 
policies, decisions, procedures, operati
ons or other activities of the 
university may be considere
d public documents under Ohio™s 

Sunshine Laws. BGSU employees are responsible for maintaining 

these records. ITS does not assume responsibility to maintain 

archives of public record documents for its email clients
.  [
(a)
 Background 
  [
ITS is responsible f
or 
managing and supporting the 
university email servers. This responsibility includes 

maintaining backups of the email system in case of 

catastrophic or system failures. These archives are expired 

on a regular schedule and only include messages that were 

in a
 client's account at the time of a backup. Our resources 
do not allow for a more extensive archive of public record 

documents of the type required by Ohio laws. Also, since 

personal correspondence is often mixed with business 

correspondence in BGSU email a
ccounts, ITS disclosure of 

contents of email accounts in response to public records 

requests might also mean disclosing personal 

correspondence
.  [(b)
 Details
  [
BGSU employees are responsible for maintaining records 

of correspondence that relates t
o university b
usiness. This 
includes electronic mail that may be subject to disclosure 

under Ohio™s Sunshine Laws. ITS recommends that 

employees familiarize themselves with these laws and with 

BGSU™s document retention policies and maintain their 

records accordingly

Electronic Communications Policy  [Section I: Introduction  [ I. INTRODUCTION  [The University of California encourages the use of electronic communications to share information and knowledge in support of the University's mission of education, research and public service and to conduct the University's business. To this end, the University supports and provides interactive electronic communications services and facilities for telecommunications, mail, publishing, and broadcasting.  [Recognizing the convergence of technologies based on voice, video, and data networks, as Presidential Policy [http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/], the University of California Electronic Communications Policy establishes principles, rules, and procedures applying to all members of the University community to specifically address issues particular to the use of electronic communications. It clarifies the applicability of law to electronic communications and references other University guidelines to ensure consistent application of the Electronic Communications Policy on all University campuses (see Appendix B, References).  [  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 1  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section II: General Provisions  [ II. GENERAL PROVISIONS A. PURPOSE  [The purposes of this Policy are to:  [ Establish policy on privacy, confidentiality, and security in electronic communications;  [ Ensure that University electronic communications resources are used for purposes appropriate to the University's mission;  [Inform the University community about the applicability of laws and University policies to electronic communications;  [ Ensure that electronic communications resources are used in compliance with those laws and University policies; and  [Prevent disruptions to and misuse of University electronic communications resources, services, and activities. B. SCOPE  [This Policy applies to:  [ All electronic communications resources owned or managed by the University;  [ All electronic communications resources provided by the University through contracts and other agreements with the University;  [ All users and uses of University electronic communications resources; and  [ All University electronic communications records in the possession of University employees or of other users of electronic communications resources provided by the University.  [ This Policy does not apply to electronic communications resources of the Department of Energy Laboratories managed by the University, or to users of such electronic communications resources who are employees and agents of those Laboratories. The Policy does apply to University users (as defined here) of the DOE Laboratories' electronic communications resources, to the extent that the provisions of the Policy are not superseded by those of DOE Laboratories managed by the University.  [ This Policy applies to the contents of electronic communications, and to the electronic attachments and transactional information associated with such communications.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 2  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section II: General Provisions  [This Policy applies only to electronic communications records in electronic form. The Policy does not apply to printed copies of electronic communications records or printed copies of transactional information. Electronic communications records in either printed or electronic form are subject to federal and state laws as well as University records management policies, including their provisions regarding retention and disclosure (see State of California Statutes, Federal Statutes and Regulations, and Business and Finance Bulletins in the Records Management and Privacy (RMP) series listed in Appendix B, References). C. DEFINITIONS  [The following terms used in this Policy are defined in Appendix A, Definitions. Knowledge of these definitions is important to an understanding of this Policy.  [ Compelling Circumstances  [Electronic Communications  [Electronic Communications Resources  [ Electronic Communications Records  [Electronic Communications Service Provider  [Electronic Communications Systems or Services  [ Emergency Circumstances  [Faculty  [ Holder of an Electronic Communications Record or Electronic Communications Holder  [ Possession of Electronic Communications Record  [Public Record  [Substantiated Reason  [ Time-dependent, Critical Operational Circumstances  [ Transactional Information  [ University Administrative Record  [University Electronic Communications Record  [University Electronic Communications Systems or Services  [ Use of Electronic Communications Services  [D.  [RESPONSIBILITIES  [1.  [Policy. This Policy is issued by the President of the University of California. The Associate Vice President, Information Resources and Communications (IR&C) in the Office of the President is responsible for maintenance of this Policy.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 3  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section II: General Provisions 2.  [Implementation. Each Chancellor, and for the Office of the President, the Senior Vice President, Business and Finance, shall designate a coordinator to administer the Policy.  [In consultation with faculty, students, and staff, the designated coordinator shall develop, maintain, and publish specific procedures and practices that implement this Policy. Campus procedures shall include information on accessibility of student information, authorized users, procedures for restricting or denying use of its electronic communications services, adjudication of complaints, network monitoring practices, and other matters as described in Attachment 2, Implementation Guidelines.  [IR&C shall facilitate regular communication among campus coordinators to address consistency in campus implementing procedures.  [ 3.  [Informational Material. Campuses shall provide users of University electronic communications resources with instructional material based on this Policy and on their own campus implementation guidelines.  [ E.  [VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND POLICY  [1. Law. Federal and state law prohibit the theft or abuse of computers and other electronic resources such as electronic communications resources, systems, and services. Abuses include (but are not limited to) unauthorized entry, use, transfer, tampering with the communications of others, and interference with the work of others and with the operation of electronic communications resources, systems, and services. The law classifies certain types of offenses as felonies (see Appendix B, References).  [2. University Disciplinary Actions. University policy prohibits the use of University property for illegal purposes and for purposes not in support of the mission of the University. In addition to legal sanctions, violators of this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion, pursuant to University policies and collective bargaining agreements. Further information on permitted and prohibited uses is given in Section III, Allowable Use.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 4  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section III: Allowable Use  [III. ALLOWABLE USE A. INTRODUCTION  [The University encourages the use of electronic communications resources and makes them widely available to the University community. Nonetheless, the use of electronic communications resources is limited by restrictions that apply to all University property and by constraints necessary for the reliable operation of electronic communications systems and services. The University reserves the right to deny use of its electronic communications services when necessary to satisfy these restrictions and constraints.  [ In general, the University cannot and does not wish to be the arbiter of the contents of electronic communications. Neither can the University always protect users from receiving electronic messages they might find offensive.  [ B.  [OWNERSHIP  [This Policy does not address the ownership of intellectual property stored on or transmitted through University electronic communications resources. Ownership of intellectual property is governed by law, the University of California Policy on Copyright Ownership (1992) and the 2003 Policy on Ownership of Course Materials, Academic Personnel Policy 020, Special Services to Individuals and Organizations (Regulation 4), and other University policies and contracts (see Appendix B, References).  [University policy issued by Vice President Bolton on October 31, 1969 and reiterated in Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-1, University Records Management Program (see Appendix B, References) assigns the ownership of the administrative records of the University to The Regents of the University of California. This applies whether such records are in paper, digital, or other format. Electronic communications records pertaining to the administrative business of the University are considered public records (see Appendix A, Definitions), whether or not the University owns the electronic communications resources, systems or services used to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, print, or otherwise record them. Other records, although not owned by The Regents, nevertheless may be subject to disclosure as public records under the California Public Records Act if they pertain to the business of the University.  [University electronic communications resources, systems and services are the property of The Regents of the University of California. These include all components of the electronic communications physical infrastructure and any  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 5  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section III: Allowable Use  [electronic communications address, number, account, or other identifier associated with the University or any unit of the University or assigned by the University to individuals, units, or functions.  [ C. ALLOWABLE USERS  [1. University Users. University students, faculty, staff, and others affiliated with the University (including those in program, contract, or license relationships with the University) may, as authorized by the Chancellor, be eligible to use University electronic communications resources and services for purposes in accordance with Sections III.D, Allowable Use.  [2. Public Users. Persons and organizations that are not University Users may only access University electronic communications resources or services under programs sponsored by the University, as authorized by the Chancellor, or for the Office of the President, the Senior Vice President, Business and Finance, for purposes of such public access in accordance with Section III.D, Allowable Use.  [3. Transient Users. Users whose electronic communications merely transit University facilities as a result of network routing protocols are not considered "Users" for the purposes of this Policy.  [ D. ALLOWABLE USES  [  [Use of University electronic communications resources is allowable subject to the following conditions:  [1. Purpose. Electronic communications resources may be provided by University units or sub-units in support of the teaching, research, and public service mission of the University, and of the administrative functions that support this mission.  [2. Non-Competition. University electronic communications resources shall not be provided to individual consumers or organizations outside the University except by approval of the Chancellor. Such services shall support the mission of the University and not be in competition with commercial providers.  [3.  [Restrictions. University electronic communications resources may not be used for:  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 6  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section III: Allowable Use  [  [unlawful activities;  [commercial purposes not under the auspices of the University;  [ personal financial gain (except as permitted under applicable academic personnel policies);  [ personal use inconsistent with Section III.D, Allowable Uses; or  [uses that violate other University or campus policies or guidelines. The latter include, but are not limited to, policies and guidelines regarding intellectual property and sexual or other forms of harassment (see Appendix B, References).  [4. Representation. Use of the University's name and seal is regulated by the State of California Education Code 92000. Users of electronic communications resources must abide by this statute as well as by University and campus policies on the use of the University's name, seals, and trademarks (see Appendix B, References). Users of electronic communications resources shall not give the impression that they are representing, giving opinions, or otherwise making statements on behalf of the University or any unit of the University unless appropriately authorized to do so.  [ 5. Endorsements. Users of electronic communications resources must abide by University and campus policies regarding endorsements. References or pointers to any non-University entity contained in University electronic communications shall not imply University endorsement of the products or services of that entity.  [ 6. False Identity and Anonymity. Users of University electronic communications resources shall not, either directly or by implication, employ a false identity (the name or electronic identification of another). However, when not prohibited by law or other University policy, a supervisor may direct an employee to use the supervisor's identity to transact University business for which the supervisor is responsible. In such cases, an employee's use of the supervisor's electronic identity does not constitute a false identity.  [A user of University electronic communications resources may use a pseudonym (an alternative name or electronic identification for oneself) for privacy or other reasons, so long as the pseudonym clearly does not constitute a false identity.  [ A user of University electronic communications resources may remain anonymous (the sender's name or electronic identification are hidden) except when publishing web pages and transmitting broadcasts.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 7  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section III: Allowable Use  [Campus guidelines and procedures may further restrict the circumstances under which pseudonyms and anonymous electronic communications are permitted.  [7. Interference. University electronic communications resources shall not be used for purposes that could reasonably be expected to cause excessive strain on any electronic communications resources, or to cause interference with others™ use of electronic communications resources.  [ Users of electronic communications services shall not: (i) send or forward chain letters or their equivalents in other services; (ii) "spam," that is, exploit electronic communications systems for purposes beyond their intended scope to amplify the widespread distribution of unsolicited electronic messages; (iii) "letter-bomb," that is, send an extremely large message or send multiple electronic messages to one or more recipients and so interfere with the recipients' use of electronic communications systems and services; or (iv) intentionally engage in other practices such as "denial of service attacks" that impede the availability of electronic communications services.  [ 8. Personal Use. University users of a University electronic communications facility or service may use that facility or service for incidental personal purposes provided that, in addition to the foregoing constraints and conditions, such use does not: (i) interfere with the University's operation of electronic communications resources; (ii) interfere with the user™s employment or other obligations to the University, or (iii) burden the University with noticeable incremental costs. When noticeable incremental costs for personal use are incurred, users shall follow campus guidelines and procedures for reimbursement to the University.  [The California Public Records Act requires the University to disclose specified public records. In response to requests for such disclosure, it may be necessary to examine electronic communications records that users consider to be personal to determine whether they are public records that are subject to disclosure (see the presumption in Appendix A, Definitions, of a University Electronic Communications Record).  [The University is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by an individual as a result of personal use of University electronic communications resources.  [ 9. Accessibility. All electronic communications intended to accomplish the academic and administrative tasks of the University shall be accessible to allowable users with disabilities in compliance with law and University policies. Alternate accommodations shall conform to law and University policies and guidelines.  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 8  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section III: Allowable Use  [ 10. Intellectual Property. The contents of all electronic communications shall conform to laws and University policies regarding protection of intellectual property, including laws and policies regarding copyright, patents, and trademarks. When the content and distribution of an electronic communication would exceed fair use as defined by the federal Copyright Act of 1976, users of University electronic communications resources shall secure appropriate permission to distribute protected material in any form, including text, photographic images, audio, video, graphic illustrations, and computer software.  [  [E. ACCESS RESTRICTION  [Eligibility to access or use University electronic communications services or electronic communications resources, when provided, is a privilege accorded at the discretion of the University. This privilege is subject to the normal conditions of use, including procedures for initiation and termination of service eligibility, established by the manager of the individual electronic communications resource.  [In addition, use of University electronic communications resources may be restricted or rescinded by the University at its discretion when required by and consistent with law, when there is substantiated reason to believe that violations of law or University policies have taken place, when there are compelling circumstances, or under time-dependent, critical operational circumstances (see Appendix A, Definitions). Restriction of use is subject to established campuswide procedures or, in the absence of such procedures, to the approval of the appropriate Vice Chancellor(s) or, for the Office of the President, the Senior Vice President, Business and Finance.  [Electronic communications resource providers may, nonetheless, restrict use of University electronic communications systems and services on a temporary basis as needed in Emergency Circumstances and Compelling Circumstances (see Appendix A, Definitions).  [In compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the University reserves the right to suspend or terminate use of University electronic communications systems and services by any user who repeatedly violates copyright law.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 9  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section IV: Privacy & Confidentiality  [IV. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY A. INTRODUCTION  [The University recognizes that principles of academic freedom and shared governance, freedom of speech, and privacy hold important implications for the use of electronic communications. This Policy reflects these firmly-held principles within the context of the University™s legal and other obligations. The University respects the privacy of electronic communications in the same way that it respects the privacy of paper correspondence and telephone conversations, while seeking to ensure that University administrative records are accessible for the conduct of the University's business.  [ The University does not examine or disclose electronic communications records without the holder™s consent. Nonetheless, subject to the requirements for authorization, notification, and other conditions specified in this Policy, the University may examine or disclose electronic communications under very limited circumstances as described in Section IV.B, Access Without Consent.  [  [University employees are prohibited from seeking out, using, or disclosing personal information in electronic communications without authorization (see Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8, Legal Requirements on Privacy of and Access to Information). University policy requires that its employees take necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of personal information encountered either in the performance of their duties or otherwise (see Business and Finance Bulletin IS-3, Electronic Information Security).  [ University contracts with outside vendors for electronic communications services shall explicitly reflect and be consistent with this Policy and other University policies related to privacy.  [B.  [ACCESS WITHOUT CONSENT  [ An electronic communications holder™s consent shall be obtained by the University prior to any access for the purpose of examination or disclosure of the contents of University electronic communications records in the holder™s possession, except as provided for below.  [The University shall permit the examination or disclosure of electronic communications records without the consent of the holder of such records only: (i) when required by and consistent with law; (ii) when there is substantiated reason (as defined in Appendix A, Definitions) to believe that violations of law or of University policies listed in Appendix C, Policies Relating to Access Without  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 10  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section IV: Privacy & Confidentiality  [Consent, have taken place; (iii) when there are compelling circumstances as defined in Appendix A, Definitions; or (iv) under time-dependent, critical operational circumstances as defined in Appendix A, Definitions.  [When under the circumstances described above the contents of electronic communications records must be examined or disclosed without the holder™s consent, the following shall apply:  [1. Authorization. Except in emergency circumstances (as defined in Appendix A, Definitions) in accordance with Section IV.B.2, Emergency Circumstances, or except for subpoenas or search warrants in accordance with Section IV.B.6, Search Warrants and Subpoenas, such actions must be authorized in advance and in writing by the responsible campus Vice Chancellor or, for the Office of the President, the Senior Vice President, Business and Finance (see Section II.D, Responsibilities).1 This authority may not be further redelegated.  [  [Authorization shall be limited to the least perusal of contents and the least action necessary to resolve the situation.  [2. Emergency Circumstances. In emergency circumstances as defined in Appendix A, Definitions, the least perusal of contents and the least action necessary to resolve the emergency may be taken immediately without authorization, but appropriate authorization must then be sought without delay following the procedures described in Section IV.B.1, Authorization, above.  [ 3. Notification. The responsible authority or designee shall at the earliest opportunity that is lawful and consistent with other University policy notify the affected individual of the action(s) taken and the reasons for the action(s) taken.  [ Each campus will issue in a manner consistent with law an annual report summarizing instances of authorized or emergency nonconsensual access pursuant to the provisions of this Section IV.B, Access Without Consent, without revealing personally identifiable data.  [4. Compliance with Law. Actions taken under Sections IV.B.1, Authorization, and IV.B.2, Emergency Circumstances, shall be in full compliance with the law and other applicable University policies, including laws and policies listed in Appendix B, References. Advice of legal counsel must always be sought prior to any action involving electronic communications records (a)  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 1 On March 18, 2004 the Regents Committee on Audit approved changes to the Internal Audit Management Charter authorizing Internal Audit to have access to University information except where prohibited by law.

Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section IV: Privacy & Confidentiality  [stored on equipment not owned or housed by the University, or (b) whose content is protected under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (see Section IV.C.1.b, Student Information).  [5. Recourse. Campus implementing procedures shall specify the process for review and appeal of actions taken under Sections IV.B.1, Authorization, and IV.B.2, Emergency Circumstances to provide a mechanism for recourse to individuals who believe that actions taken by employees or agents of the University were in violation of this Policy.  [6. Search Warrants and Subpoenas.  [Search warrants and subpoenas are not subject to sections 1-2 and 4-5 above.  [Search warrants and subpoenas for electronic communications records shall be referred to University legal counsel at the Office of the General Counsel or designated officials at campus locations.  [Search Warrants. Duly signed search warrants shall be processed in accordance with federal and state laws, University policies, and instructions in the warrant.  [Subpoenas.  [Subpoenas shall be processed in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and University policies (see Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-10, Instructions for Responding to Subpoena).  [Campus officials shall provide advance notice to individuals whose records are the subject of a subpoena duces tecum in accordance with instructions and time requirements in RMP-10, section III.C, ﬁResponding to requests for personal records of a consumer.ﬂ C.  [PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND LIMITS  [1. Privacy Protections  [a. Personal Information. Federal and California law provide privacy protections for some information that personally identifies an individual. Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8, Legal Requirements on Privacy of and Access to Information, provides guidelines for the collection and use of personal information in conformance with the law. These guidelines apply to information collected and disseminated by electronic means just as they do to records stored on paper and other media.  [b.  [Student Information. Users of electronic communications systems and services shall not disclose information about students in violation of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), and the University policies that provide guidance in meeting FERPA requirements. See Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8, Legal  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 12  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section IV: Privacy & Confidentiality  [Requirements on Privacy of and Access to Information, and the University's Policy Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records (Sections 130-134 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students).  [ c. Electronically Gathered Data.  [Any collection or distribution of personally identifiable information shall be consistent with federal and state law and University policy (see Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8, Legal Requirements on Privacy of and Access to Information). Except when otherwise provided by law, users of University electronic communications systems and services shall be informed whenever personally identifiable information other than transactional information (see Appendix A, Definitions) will be collected and stored automatically by the system or service.  [In addition, California law requires state agencies and the California State University to enable users to terminate an electronic communications transaction without leaving personal data (see Appendix B, References). All electronic communications systems and services in which the University is a partner with a state agency or the California State University must conform to this requirement.  [ In no case shall electronic communications that contain personally identifiable information about individuals, including data collected by the use of "cookies" or otherwise automatically gathered, be sold or distributed to third parties without the explicit permission of the individual.  [ d. Telephone Conversations. In compliance with federal law, audio or video telephone conversations shall not be recorded or monitored without advising the participants unless a court has explicitly approved such monitoring or recording. Emergency services shall record 911-type emergency calls in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.  [Participants shall be informed when a call is being monitored or recorded for the purpose of evaluating customer service, assessing workload, or other business purpose permitted by law. University units that monitor or record telephone calls shall provide an alternative method of doing business with the University to clients who do not wish to be part of a monitored telephone call.  [ 2. Privacy Limits  [  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 13  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section IV: Privacy & Confidentiality  [a. Possession of Public Records. University employees shall comply with University requests for copies of public records in their possession, regardless of whether such records reside on University electronic communications resources.  [ b. System Monitoring.  [University employees who operate and support electronic communications resources regularly monitor transmissions for the purpose of ensuring reliability and security of University electronic communications resources and services (see Section V.B, Security Practices), and in that process might observe certain transactional information or the contents of electronic communications. Except as provided elsewhere in this Policy or by law, they are not permitted to seek out transactional information or contents when not germane to system operations and support, or to disclose or otherwise use what they have observed.  [In the process of such monitoring, any unavoidable examination of electronic communications (including transactional information) shall be limited to the least invasive degree of inspection required to perform such duties. This exception does not exempt systems personnel from the prohibition (see Section IV.A, Introduction) against disclosure of personal or confidential information..  [Except as provided above, systems personnel shall not intentionally search the contents of electronic communications or transactional information for violations of law or policy. However, if in the course of their duties systems personnel inadvertently discover or suspect improper governmental activity (including violations of law or University policy), reporting of such violations shall be consistent with the Policy on Reporting and Investigating Allegations of Suspected Improper Governmental Activities (the "Whistleblower Policyﬂ).  [ c. Back-up Services. Operators of University electronic communications resources shall provide information about back-up procedures to users of those services upon request.  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 14  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section V: Security  [V. SECURITY  [A. INTRODUCTION  [The University makes reasonable efforts to provide secure and reliable electronic communications services. Operators of University electronic communications resources are expected to follow appropriate professional practices in providing for the security of electronic communications records, data, application programs, and systems following guidelines provided in Business and Finance Bulletin IS-3, Electronic Information Security.  [ IS-3 provides guidelines for managing the security of electronic information resources used to conduct activities in support of the University™s mission. IS-3 guidelines apply to the security of University electronic information resources in the form of electronic communications, stored data, and electronic communications resources used to transmit and process such records and data. B. SECURITY PRACTICES  [Providers of electronic communications services ensure the integrity and reliability of systems under their control through the use of various techniques that include routine monitoring of electronic communications.  [Network traffic may be inspected to confirm malicious or unauthorized activity that may harm the campus network or devices connected to the network. Such activity shall be limited to the least perusal of contents required to resolve the situation. User consent is not required for these routine monitoring practices.  [ Providers shall document and make available to their users general information about these monitoring practices. If providers determine that it is necessary to examine suspect electronic communications records beyond routine practices, the user™s consent shall be sought.  [If circumstances prevent prior consent, notification procedures described in Section IV.B.3, Notification shall be followed.  [C.  [INTEGRITY  [No person shall attempt to breach any security mechanisms that protect electronic communications services or facilities or any records or messages associated with these services or facilities unless otherwise authorized by other provisions of this Policy.  [ University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 15  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Section V: Security  [D. AUTHENTICATION  [Electronic communications service providers (see Appendix A, Definitions) shall maintain currency with authentication technologies supported by the University and implement them in accordance with Business and Finance Bulletin IS-3, Electronic Information Security, and commensurate with applicable security requirements.  [E. AUTHORIZATION  [Service providers shall use authorization technologies commensurate with security requirements of the service, application, or system. See Business and Finance Bulletin IS-3, Electronic Information Security, for requirements regarding access management of the University™s electronic information resources.  [F. ENCRYPTION  [Where deemed appropriate, electronic communications containing restricted data as defined in Business and Finance Bulletin IS-3, Electronic Information Security should be encrypted during transit across communications networks.  [Other communications may be encrypted during transit. All encrypted communications shall be handled upon receipt in conformance with the storage requirements for electronic information resources, as defined in IS-3. G. RECOVERY  [Providers of campuswide or Universitywide electronic communications services shall implement recovery practices adequate to ensure rapid recovery from security intrusions and service interruptions.  [H.  [AUDIT  [Providers of electronic communications services shall use cost-effective audit technologies and practices to help identify security violators and speed up recovery from security incidents. The use of such audit technologies and practices shall not conflict with other provisions of this Policy, in particular Section IV, Privacy and Confidentiality.

 VI. RETENTION AND DISPOSITION  [A. RETENTION 
 Electronic communications records are subject to University records management 
policies as stated in the University of California Records Disposition Schedules 
Manual, which provides guidance for administering the retention and disposition 
of all records, regardless of the medium on which they are stored.  [ 
 B. DISPOSITION  [The Record Proprietor, as defined in Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-1, 
University Records Management Program, is responsible for preserving those 
electronic communications records that have been identified as having lasting 

business purpose or historical value to the University.  [C. BACK-UP  [The University does not maintain central or distributed electronic archives of all 

electronic communications records sent or received. Electronic communications 
records are normally backed up, if at all, only to assure system integrity and 

reliability, not to provide for future retrieval, although back-ups may at times 

serve the latter purpose incidentally. Operators of University electronic 
communications services are not required by this Policy to routinely retrieve 

electronic communications records from such back-up facilities for individuals. 
 
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Appendix A: Definitions  [ APPENDIX A: DEFINITIONS  [Compelling Circumstances: Circumstances in which failure to act might result in significant bodily harm, significant property loss or damage, loss of significant evidence of one or more violations of law or of University policies listed in Appendix C, Policies Relating to Access Without Consent, or significant liability to the University or to members of the University community.  [Electronic Communications: Any transfer of signals, writings, images, sounds, data or intelligence that is, created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic communications systems2. For purposes of this Policy, an electronic file that has not been transmitted is not an electronic communication.  [Electronic Communications Records: The contents of electronic communications created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic communications systems or services. This definition of electronic communications records applies equally to attachments to such records and transactional information associated with such records.  [Electronic Communications Resources: Telecommunications equipment, transmission devices, electronic video and audio equipment, encoding or decoding equipment, computers and computer time, data processing or storage systems, computer systems, servers, networks, input/output and connecting devices, and related computer records, programs, software, and documentation that supports electronic communications services.  [Electronic Communications Service Provider: Any unit, organization, or staff with responsibility for managing the operation of and controlling individual user access to any part of the University's electronic communications systems and services.  [Electronic Communications Systems or Services: Any messaging, collaboration, publishing, broadcast, or distribution system that depends on electronic communications resources to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, distribute, broadcast, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print electronic records for purposes of communication across electronic communications network systems between or among individuals or groups, that is either explicitly denoted as a system for electronic communications or is implicitly used for such purposes.  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [2 Definition is modeled on language contained in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (see US Code Title 18 § 2510). University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 18  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Appendix A: Definitions  [Emergency Circumstances: Circumstances in which time is of the essence and there is a high probability that delaying action would almost certainly result in compelling circumstances.  [Faculty: A member of the faculty as defined by Academic Personnel Policy 110-4 (14).  [Holder of an Electronic Communications Record or Electronic Communications Holder: An electronic communications user who, at a given point in time, is in possession (see definition below) or receipt of a particular electronic communications record, whether or not that electronic communications user is the original creator or a recipient of the content of the record.  [Possession of Electronic Communications Record: An individual is in possession of an electronic communications record, whether the original record or a copy or modification of the original record, when that individual has effective control over the location of its storage or access to its content. Thus, an electronic communications record that resides on an electronic communications server awaiting download to an addressee is deemed, for purposes of this Policy, to be in the possession of that addressee. Systems administrators and other operators of University electronic communications services are excluded from this definition of possession with regard to electronic communications not specifically created by or addressed to them.  [ Electronic communications users are not responsible for electronic communications records in their possession when they have no knowledge of the existence or contents of such records.  [Public Record: A record as defined in Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8, Legal Requirements on Privacy of and Access to Information, and/or the California Public Records Act. Public records include writings or other forms of recording that contain information relating to the conduct of the public's business in materials prepared, owned, used, or retained by the University regardless of physical form or characteristics [California Government Code Section 6252(e)]. Except for certain defined situations, such records are subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.  [For more information regarding the requirements of the Public Records Act, and the University™s implementation of that Act, including exemptions from disclosure, see RMP-8.  [Substantiated Reason: Reliable evidence indicating that violation of law or of University policies listed in Appendix C, Policies Relating to Access Without Consent, probably has occurred, as distinguished from rumor, gossip, or other unreliable evidence.  [Time-dependent, Critical Operational Circumstances: Circumstances in which failure to act could seriously hamper the ability of the University to function administratively or to meet its teaching obligations, but excluding circumstances pertaining to personal or professional activities, or to faculty research or matters of shared governance.  [  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [  [ 19  [  [
Electronic Communications Policy  [ Appendix A: Definitions  [Transactional Information: Information, including electronically gathered information, needed either to complete or to identify an electronic communication. Examples include but are not limited to: electronic mail headers, summaries, addresses and addressees; records of telephone calls; and IP address logs.  [University Administrative Record: A Public Record (see definition above) that documents or contains information related to the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other business activities of the University.  [ University Electronic Communications Record: A Public Record in the form of an electronic communications record, whether or not any of the electronic communications resources utilized to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, distribute, broadcast, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print the electronic communications record are owned by the University. This implies that the location of the record, or the location of its creation or use, does not change its nature (i) as a University electronic communications record for purposes of this or other University policy, and (ii) as having potential for disclosure under the California Public Records Act.  [ Until determined otherwise or unless it is clear from the context, any electronic communications record residing on university-owned or controlled telecommunications, video, audio, and computing facilities will be deemed to be a University electronic communications record for purposes of this Policy. This would include personal electronic communications. Consistent with the principles of least perusal and least action necessary and of legal compliance, the University must make a good faith a priori effort to distinguish University electronic communications records from personal and other electronic communications in situations relevant to disclosures under the California Public Records Act and other laws, or for other applicable provisions of this Policy.  [University Electronic Communications Systems or Services: Electronic communications systems or services owned or operated by the University or any of its sub-units or provided through contracts with the University.  [Use of Electronic Communications Services: To create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, distribute, broadcast, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print electronic communications with the aid of electronic communications services. An Electronic Communications User is an individual who makes use of electronic communications services.  [ The act of receipt of electronic communications as contrasted with actual viewing of the record by the recipient is excluded from the definition of "use" to the extent that the recipient does not have advance knowledge of the contents of the electronic communications record.

Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories I. INTRODUCTION  [University policies often interpret the application of federal and state laws to the University community. The Electronic Communications Policy interprets the application of other University policies, as well as federal and state laws, to electronic communications. Users of electronic communications who are in doubt concerning the permissibility of an intended action should seek guidance from the Universitywide Electronic Communications Policy and, where they exist, local campus implementing guidelines and other computer policies that may interpret policy or address areas not explicitly covered by Universitywide policies. II. USER RESPONSIBILITIES A. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW The Electronic Communications Policy refers to federal laws that prohibit:  [  [Monitoring telephone conversations without informing participants or without a court order;  [Using the Internet to make available intellectual property belonging to another in such a way as to cause the loss of $2500 or more;  [Infringing copyright by electronic communications.  [The Electronic Communications Policy refers to California laws that govern the use of computer equipment, systems and services, and which apply to electronic communications as well. Section 502 of the California Penal Code prescribes criminal penalties for:  [ Using electronic means to defraud others;  [Using data or documentation without permission;  [Using electronic equipment without permission;  [Tampering with data, software, or programs;  [Disrupting or causing denial of services to authorized users;  [Accessing or providing access to others without permission;  [Introducing computer contaminants, such as viruses; and  [Using the Internet domain name of another.  [In general, behaviors that are prohibited in the physical environment are also prohibited in the digital environment.  [ B. ALLOWABLE USES  [The Electronic Communications Policy identifies ten principles that govern the allowable use of University electronic communications resources. Users are advised  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [1  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories to review local campus computing guidelines that specify how these are implemented and enforced at each University location (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section III.D, Allowable Use).  [In accordance with federal law, users should assume that material created by others, in electronic or other form, is protected by copyright unless such material includes an explicit statement that it is not protected, or unless such material is clearly in the public domain (see the Electronic Communications Policy, Section III.D.10,  [Intellectual Property).  [C. COURTESY  [The University cannot protect users of University electronic communications resources from receiving communications they may not wish to receive. Members of the University community are strongly encouraged to use the same personal and professional courtesies and considerations in electronic communications as they would in other forms of communication (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV.A, Introduction).  [ III. PRIVACY EXPECTATIONS  [Various laws and available security technologies affect the degree of privacy that users can expect. Generally, laws relating to more mature communications technologies are more fully developed than those governing newer technologies as a result of court interpretations that have led to consensus about their application. For example, laws that circumscribe the privacy of telephone communications are well established while those that apply to electronic mail are not. While some laws support higher expectations of privacy, other laws interfere with such expectations (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV.C, Privacy Protections and Limits).  [Users commonly associate different levels of privacy with various electronic communications technologies or with alternative uses of those technologies. For example:  [ Users generally expect a high level of privacy with telephone conversations, and these expectations are generally protected by law;  [ Users often expect a similarly high level of privacy with electronic mail, but (i) these expectations are not always supported by law, and (ii) recipients may compromise confidentiality by redirecting electronic mail messages;  [ Users might expect a more moderate level of privacy with electronic communications intended for distribution to a limited audience, since privacy can be compromised by the limit of available security protections or by the behavior  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [2  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories of members of the intended audience (a user, for example, might share a password without knowledge or consent of the originator of the communication); and  [ Users should expect minimal or no privacy in broadcast communications, such as television or unprotected web pages, because they are accessible to a wide, unspecified audience.  [ IV. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS  [Two categories of information that are protected from disclosure by law are information that personally identifies an individual and certain information pertaining to students. In addition, state and federal laws partially limit the use of automated electronic data gathering tools to collect and store personally identifiable information about individuals without their knowledge or consent (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV, Privacy and Confidentiality). In spite of these legal protections users of electronic communications should exercise caution to protect their privacy.  [A. PERSONAL INFORMATION  [Users of electronic communications systems and services should be aware of the difficulty of maintaining privacy and confidentiality on the web and should be particularly careful about posting personal information on the web. They should note that even web pages that have no pointers to or from other web pages might be found by search engines.  [  [Users who do not want their electronic mail addresses made public are cautioned not to send electronic communications to mailing list systems, chat rooms, web pages, and newsgroups where they might be discovered or otherwise used for purposes over which the individual has no control.  [B. STUDENT PRIVACY  [Federal law protecting student privacy is incorporated into University policies. In accordance with the policies and procedures in the University's Policy Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records (Sections 130-134 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students), campuses are responsible for designating the categories of personally identifiable information about a student that are public. Individual students may, consistent with the above policy, request the campus not to make public their electronic mail addresses and telephone numbers (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section II.D, Responsibilities and Section IV.C, Privacy Protections and Limits).  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [3  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories  [C. ELECTRONIC DATA GATHERING  [Legislation protecting the privacy of electronic communications users is still evolving. There are currently few laws that would adequately protect users from electronic data gathering without their permission (see Electronic Communications Policy Section V.C, Privacy Protections and Limits).  [V. PRIVACY LIMITS A. INTRODUCTION  [The privacy of electronic communications at the University is limited by: i) laws that protect the public's right to know about the public business; ii) policies that require employees to comply with management requests for University records in their possession; and iii) technical requirements for efficient operation of University electronic communications resources (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV, Privacy & Confidentiality).  [ Privacy and confidentiality might also be compromised by unintended redistribution or by the inadequacy of current technologies to protect against unauthorized access. Therefore, users should exercise extreme caution in using electronic communications to transmit confidential or sensitive matters.  [Guidance on storage, disposal, and preservation of records is addressed in the Appendices to RMP-2, ﬁRecords Retention and Disposition: Principles, Processes, and Guidelines.ﬂ  [B. PUBLIC RECORDS  [Users of University electronic communications services should be aware that the California Public Records Act and other similar laws make it impossible for the University to guarantee complete protection of an individual's personal electronic communications records resident on University facilities (see Electronic Communications Policy Section III.D.8, Personal Use).  [The University does not automatically comply with all requests for disclosure, but evaluates all such requests against the precise provisions of the California Public Records Act, other laws concerning disclosure and privacy, and other applicable law. Business and Finance Bulletin RMP-8 and personnel manuals and agreements provide guidelines for University implementation of the California Public Records Act.  [Electronic communications records arising from personal use may be difficult to distinguish from public records, and such records may be subject to inspection or disclosure pursuant to the California Public Records Act (see the presumption in the  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [4  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories Electronic Communications Policy, Appendix A, Definitions, of a University Electronic Communications Record, regarding personal and other electronic communications records). Users should assess the implications of this presumption in their decision to use University electronic communications resources for personal purposes.  [ The California Public Records Act does not in general apply to records generated or held by students except in their capacity, if any, as employees or agents of the University. This exemption only applies to the Act and does not exclude students' electronic communications from other aspects of this Policy.  [ C. UNIVERSITY POLICIES  [In addition to University policies that require employees to comply with management requests for University records in their possession, other University policies affect the privacy of some forms of electronic communication.  [In compliance with law, the University does not record or monitor audio or video telephone conversations except as described below, unless under court order. The law permits the University to monitor or record calls for the purpose of evaluating customer service, assessing workload, or other business purposes. In such cases the University advises the participants that the call is being monitored or recorded. Users who do not wish to be part of a monitored telephone call should be aware that University units are required to provide them with an alternative method of doing business with the University (see Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV.C. Privacy Protections and Limits).  [The use of University telephone equipment creates transaction records (which include the number called and the time and length of the call) that are reviewed by University units and sub-units as part of routine accounting procedures. Employees who use University telephones for personal or other purposes should be aware that supervisors have access to records of all calls made from University telephones under their jurisdiction and that such records may be used for administrative purposes.  [D. UNINTENDED DISTRIBUTION  [Both the nature of electronic mail and the public character of the University's business make electronic mail less private than users might anticipate. For example, electronic mail intended for one person sometimes might be widely distributed because of the ease with which recipients can forward it to others. A reply to an electronic mail message posted on an electronic bulletin board or mailing list system intended only for the originator of the message might be distributed to all subscribers to the mailing list system. Users of workstations in public computer laboratories might forget to remove files after they finish their work. Even after a user deletes an  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [5  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories electronic mail record, it might persist on back-up or local facilities and become subject to disclosure under the provisions of Section IV.B, Access Without Consent, of this Policy. The University cannot routinely protect users against such eventualities.  [Users of telephone, video teleconference, and other telecommunications services are advised that although electronic communications are subject to the non-consensual access provisions of the Electronic Communications Policy Section IV.B, their privacy might be compromised by the presence of persons listening to speaker phones or participating in teleconference calls and video teleconferences without announcing their presence.  [E. ELECTRONIC DATA GATHERING  [Users of electronic communications systems or services should also be aware that by accessing electronic communications resources, users create transaction records that leave a trail of the electronic communications resources used and might give information about the users and their activities. Current state and federal laws governing such electronic data gathering may not fully protect the user from the gathering of such information without their knowledge or consent.  [Users are advised to read the privacy statement of any application that collects personally identifiable information to learn its disclosure and privacy policies.  [VI. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS A. SECURITY  [Encryption technology enables the encoding of electronic communications so that for all practical purposes they cannot be read by anyone who does not possess the commensurate technology needed to decrypt them. Users of electronic communications services should be aware that the University does not routinely encrypt electronic communications during transit across its facilities.  [If there is a concern about possible interception or disclosure of electronic communications, correspondents should implement appropriate encryption technology while ensuring conformance with BFB IS-3.  [ Since the University is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by an individual as a result of personal use of University electronic communications resources, users should not rely on personal use of University electronic communications resources for communications that might be sensitive with regard to timing, financial effect, or privacy and confidentiality. (See the Electronic Communications Policy, Section III.D.8, Personal Use.)  [  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [6  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories B. AUTHENTICATION  [Unless authentication technologies are in use, there is no guarantee that an electronic communication received was in fact sent by the purported sender, since it is relatively straightforward, although a violation of the Electronic Communications Policy, for senders to falsify their identity. Electronic communications that are forwarded might also be modified. General purpose (in contrast to application specific) authentication technologies are not widely and systematically in use at the University as of the issuance of the Policy, but can be expected in future.  [ As with print documents, recipients of electronic communications should, in case of doubt, check directly with the purported sender to validate the authenticity of the sender or the content.  [ C. BACK-UP  [Electronic communications systems are backed up on a routine or occasional basis to protect system reliability and integrity, and to prevent potential loss of data. The back-up process entails the copying of electronic data onto storage media that might be retained for periods of time and in locations unknown to the originator or recipient of electronic communications. The practice and frequency of back-ups and the retention of back-up copies vary from system to system. Users are encouraged to request information on local back-up practices followed by the operators of University electronic communications resources, and such operators are required to provide such information to users upon request (see the Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV.C, Privacy Protections and Limits).  [Users of electronic communications resources should be aware that even if they have discarded copies of an electronic communication stored on devices they can control, back-up copies could exist on other devices. Back-up copies that are able to be retrieved might be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act or, in litigation, as the result of the discovery process.  [ D. DISPOSITION  [Electronic communications users should be aware that generally it is not possible to assure the longevity of electronic communications records for record-keeping purposes, in part because of the difficulty of guaranteeing that they can continue to be read in the face of changing formats and technologies, and in part because of the changing nature of electronic communications systems. Archiving is increasingly difficult as electronic communications encompass more digital forms, such as compound records composed of digital voice, music, image, and video in addition to text. In the absence of the use of authentication systems it is difficult to guarantee that electronic communications have not been intentionally or inadvertently altered (see  [University of California Revised August 18, 2005  [  [7  [ 
Electronic Communications Policy  [Attachment 1: User Advisories the Electronic Communications Policy, Section IV.C, Privacy Protections and Limits and Section V.C, Authentication).  [Those in possession of University records in the form of electronic communications are cautioned, therefore, to be prudent in their reliance on electronic means for purposes of maintaining a lasting record. Sound business practice suggests that consideration be given to the feasibility of transferring electronic communications records to a more lasting medium or format, such as acid-free paper or microfilm, for long-term accessibility as required.

Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 3 II. ALLOWABLE USE
  [A. ALLOWABLE USERS
  [Chancellors shall establish guidelines as to who may use the electronic 
communications resources under their jurisdiction. Campus guidelines should 

reflect the following general principles of the Electronic Communications Policy:
  [ Section III.C identifies members of the University community as the intended 
users of University electronic communications resources; 
 Section III.D.1, Purpose, requires that use of University electronic 

communications resources be in support of 
the University's mission; 
  [Section III.D.2, Non-Competition, requires that campuses not compete with 

private electronic communications providers by providing services to users 
outside the University except where such services are unique or where 

providing them demonstrably supports the University's mission;  [
 Section III.E, Access Restriction, declares that access to University electronic 

communications resources is a privilege rather than a right; 
 Section III.E, Access Restriction, allows for restriction of 
access under 
specified circumstances regardless of the normal conditions of use established 
by the manager of the individual electronic communications resource. 
 Campus guidelines should begin from the assumption that the level of access 

granted University Users of electronic communications resources terminates when 

the user's affiliation with the University ends. Exceptions may be made when 

extending this level of access serves the University's mission and does not 

constitute competition with commercial s
ervice providers. 
 B. ALLOWABLE USES 
  [1. Representation.
 When an electronic communication inaccurately gives the 
impression that the author represents the University, the communication must 
include an explicit disclaimer. Campus guidelines should provide means of 

meeting this requirement concerning implied representation. Among other 

alternatives, they may: i) provide specifications for a context that makes a 

disclaimer unnecessary for a particular electronic communications service; ii) 

provide for a common d
isclaimer that can be shared by users of an electronic 

communications 
service; or iii) suggest the wording of a disclaimer to be 

included by the author, e.g. "These statements are my own, not those of the 

Regents of the University of California." 
  [2. Endorsements. 
When an electronic communication might give the 

impression that the author's endorsement represents an endorsement by the 

Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 4 University, the communication must include an explicit disclaimer. Campus 
guidelines should provide means of meeting thi
s requirement concerning 
implied endorsements. Among other alternatives, they may: i) provide 

specifications for a context that makes a disclaimer unnecessary for a 

particular electronic communications service; ii) provide for a common 

disclaimer that can be shared by users of an electronic 
communications 

service; or iii) suggest the wording of a disclaimer to be included by the 

author, e.g. "References or pointers to non-University entities do not represent 

endorsement by the Regents of the University of C
alifornia
." 
 Campus guidelines shall not restrict faculty evaluation of educational 

materials in the context of teaching and research. 
  [3. Anonymity. 
Campus guidelines may restrict the circumstances under which 
pseudonyms and anonymity are permitted in electronic communications. 

However, local guidelines must not preclude the use of anonymous electronic 

communications for the purpose of whistleblowing, in conformance with the 

Policy on Reporting and Investigating Allegations of Suspected Improper 

Governmen
tal Activities (the "Whistleblower Policyﬂ).
  [Public communications such as web publication and broadcast transmissions 

may not be anonymous (see Use of Specific Services below).
  [4. Interference. 
Campus guidelines should identify examples of behaviors tha
t are likely to interfere with the operation of University electronic 
communications resources so users can, in good faith, avoid them. Guidelines 

should clarify that additional behaviors may also prove to be disruptive, since 

technological advances may le
ad to new abuses of electronic communications 
resources. Guidelines should also distinguish between behaviors that are 

purposeful and those that cause unintended disruption of services. 
 5. Personal Use.
 Campus implementing guidelines may specify terms and
 conditions for the personal use of specific electronic communications services, 

consistent with the provisions for personal use in Policy Section III.D.8. 
 Operators of electronic communications systems and services may (consistent 

with Policy Sections II
I.D.7, Interference, and V.A and B, Security) proscribe 
specific personal use practices (see Interference above). In addition, operators 

may restrict access, according to established campus procedures, to electronic 

communications resources for personal use on an ad hoc or long term basis as 

described in the Policy, Section III.E, Access Restriction. 

 
Users should be encouraged to avoid noticeable incremental charges to the 

University for personal use of University facilities by employing telephone 

cards, private email accounts, and other mechanisms to charge such costs to 

personal accounts. When personal use causes noticeable incremental costs to 

Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 5 the University, users shall reimburse the University following campus 
procedures and guidelines (see Electronic 
Communications Policy Section 

III.D.8, Personal Use and Responsibilities above). 
 
6. Accessibility
. Operators of University electronic communications resources 
should coordinate with campus officers responsible for implementation of the 

Americans with Disabilities Act to ensure that persons with disabilities have 

access to those resources.
  [7. Intellectual Property.
 As required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 
campuses should provide users with information regarding copyright laws and 

should refer them to the University's Guidelines for Compliance with the 

Online Service Provider Provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 

(see Electronic Communications Policy Section III.D.10). 
 C. ACCESS RESTRICTION
  [
 The Policy does not require the same high level authorization for restricting users' 

access to electronic communications resources as it does for noncon
sensual access 

by others to electronic communications records without the consent of the holder. 

However, campus implementing guidelines must identify the procedures for 

restricting access when the authorization of a Vice Chancellor is not required. 

Such procedures must conform to the requirements of Policy Section III.E, 

Access Restriction, and be applicable on a consistent basis campuswide.  [

Electronic communications resource providers may, nonetheless, restrict access 

on a temporary basis as needed in Em
ergency Circumstances and Compelling 
Circumstances (see Electronic Communications Policy Section IV.B.2, 

Emergency Circumstances, and Appendix A, Definitions) in order to control an 

emergency or prevent damage or loss. 
 D. 
 USE OF SPECIFIC SERVICES 
  [
1.  [W
eb Pages
  [Campus guidelines shall ensure that the following requirements for publishing 

web pages are met:
  [a.  [Identification. 
Web pages shall not be posted anonymously at addresses 
within a University domain (i.e., campus.edu). Campus guidelines may 

esta
blish local standards for identifying the University unit, sub-unit, 

program, or individual responsible for the page.  [
 
Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 6 b. Official University Web Pages
. The Chancellor shall determine what 
rules to apply to web pages in order to comply with provisions of Pol
icy 
Sections III.D. 4 and 5, Representation and Endorsement. For this 
purpose, the Chancellor may designate certain web pages as official 

University web pages. Conversely, the Chancellor may designate 

mechanisms for identifying personal web pages that do n
ot represent the 

University. Any identification used to denote official web pages must not 

be used for other web pages. 
 c. Personal Web Pages.
 The establishment of personal web pages is subject 
to campus approval (see Personal Use, above). When personal web pages 

are permitted, campus guidelines should specify the conditions under 

which personal web pages are permitted. In addition, campus guide
lines 
should establish local standards that will enable users to recognize that the 

page represents the individual rather than the University (see 

Representation and Endorsements, above).
  [2. Radio Frequency Stations
  [a. Station Licenses
. Operation of radio frequency stations (including 
television, radio, auxiliary broadcast facilities, maritime, aeronautical, land 

mobile, satellite, microwave, and paging) requires Federal 

Communications Commission licensing. Campuses shall apply for such 

licenses through t
he Office of the Associate Vice President, Information 
Resources and Communications. 
 b. Radio Frequency Interference
. Users of telecommunications radio 

frequency transmitters and receivers shall operate such equipment in 

compliance with regulations of the 
Federal Communications Commission. 

In particular, users shall not interfere with other station operators or other 

users on the same station, regardless of whether such operators or users 

are affiliated with the University.
  [
 III. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALI
TY  [ A. 
 ACCESS WITHOUT CONSENT 
  [Each Chancellor shall establish guidelines and procedures for authorization, 

advice, notification, and recourse in cases of nonconsensual access to electronic 

communications (see Responsibilities, above).  [
 
Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 7 1. Authorization.
 Campus procedures for authorization to access electronic 
communications without consent shall include the following 
requirements
:  [  [Requests for nonconsensual access must be submitted in writing except in 
emergency circumstances.  [In accordance with Policy
 Section IV.B.2, 
Emergency Circumstances, actions must be limited to the least perusal of 
contents and the least action necessary to resolve the emergency.  [

Appropriate written authorization must subsequently be sought without 

delay.
  [  [  [Advice of campus 
legal 
counsel or an attorney in the Office of General 
Counsel shall be sought prior to authorization of nonconsensual access.  [

Counsel™s advice shall be sought in the event of receipt of legal documents 

demanding information, such as search warrant, subpoena, or subpoena 

duces tecum
, in accordance with Policy Section IV.B, Access without 
Consent, 
RMP
-10, Instructions for Responding to Subpoena, and campus 
implementing procedures. 

 2. Procedures concerning faculty
.  [Chancellors shall confer with their 
respective Divisional Senate to establish procedures for nonconsensual access 

to electronic com
munications where the examination
 or disclosure involves 
electronic communications held by faculty.
  [3. Notification. 
Advice of 
legal c
ounsel shall be sought in det
ermining whether 
there is reason not to notify an individual that his or her electronic 

communications have been accessed without consent. 
 4. Annual Report.
 Each Chancellor shall annually report to the Office of 
Information Resources and Communications in th
e Office of the President the 
number of cases of nonconsensual access to electronic communications that 

have taken place. The annual report will identify the:
  [ Number of requests for nonconsensual access, 
 Number of requests granted on emergency basis, 
 Numb
er of requests granted after prior approval, 
 Number of requests denied, and 
 Reasons for requests: (i) Required by and consistent with law, (ii) 
Substantiated reason to believe that violations of law or University 
policies have taken place, (iii) Compelling circumstances, and/or (iv) 

Time
-dependent, critical operational circumstances.
  [Annual reports shall consist of summary numbers with no information about 

individual cases, and shall be posted on the web so the data will be available 

to the University community and the public.

included in annual reports. 
 5. Recourse. 
Campus procedures for appeal of decisions regarding 

nonconsensual access to electronic communications (whether under normal 

authorization procedures or Emergency Circumstances) should whenever 

possible use existing mechanisms for faculty, staff, and student actions and 

appeals. 
  [
 B. 
 PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND LIMITS
  [1. Personal Information. 
A written release should be obtained prior to posting, 
broadcasting, or distributing an individual's picture or statement, except in 
cases of news reporting. 
  [2. Student Information. 
Campus guidelines should clarify what student 

info
rmation may and may not be released, consistent with Policy Section 
IV.C.1.b, Student Information, and Responsibilities I.B.g. above. 
 3. Electronically Gathered Data. 
When a University electronic 
communications service automatically collects information a
bout a user (for 
instance, through cookies and banner ads), notice to that effect should be 

posted at the beginning of the transaction and should indicate what 

information will be collected and how it will be used. Ideally, users should be 

allowed to termi
nate the transaction at that point without leaving data behind.  [

 4. System Monitoring.
  [Campus guidelines shall ensure that University 
personnel who operate and support electronic communications resources 

understand and comply with the provisions of Policy Section IV.C.2.b, 

System Monitoring
, regarding the conditions under which they may observe 
the contents of electronic communications or transactional information. This 

section of the Policy also requires that they not disclose the contents of 

communicati
ons they have observed, except as required by law or policy. 

Providers of electronic communications services shall document and make 

available general information about the monitoring practices of systems under 

their control consistent with Policy Section 
V.B. Security Practices.
  [This 
information shall include types of monitoring activities, the level of inspection 

required to examine suspect electronic communications records, and 

accompanying procedures. This information serves to meet the ECP provision 

requiring the documentation of routine monitoring practices. 
 For purposes of the Electronic Communications Policy, automated inspection 

of electronic communications in order to protect the integrity 
and reliability 
of 
University electronic communication
s resources does not constitute

, and V.A., Security).  [
 5.  [Access to University Administrative Records.
 Consistent with Policy Section IV.A, Introduction, campus guidelines shall 

include procedures to ensure that University administrative records are 

accessible for the conduct of the University™s business.  [

 
a. Absences
. In order to reduce the need to access an 
employee™s electronic 
communications records in the event of absence, campuses 
are encouraged 

to use techniques or procedures to minimize the need to gain access 
without consent.  [Following are some practices that campuses may 

implement.
  [ﬁAbsenceﬂ message
s.  [Include in procedures the requirement that 
absence messages be installed to indicate the period of time of absence 

and alternate contact information. 
 Email forwarding
.  [Use email forwarding capabilities, if available, so 
that during planned absences el
ectronic communications will be 
forwarded to authorized individual(s). 
 Workgroup accounts
.  [Establish common workgroup accounts for 
department
-related business so essential departmental business 
electronic communications are accessible to all workgroup mem
bers.
  [Autoforwarding with Filtering
.  [Set filters to forward selected 

electronic communications to relevant staff in the holder™s absence.
  [Mailing lists
.  [Establish mailing lists so that all subscribers receive a 
copy of any messages posted to the list.
  [Shared files
.  [Establish file server capability to store and access 
documents in support of business operations.  [Authorization and 
access procedures must be clearly documented.
  [Campuses
 may also e
stablish a central campus approval process to obtain 
pre
-approved user consent to allow access to user™s electronic 
communications records
.  [Each agreement must be on a case
-by-case basis 
rather than for groups
, and the agreement must address
 only narrowly
 defined circumstances, e.g., emergency medical leave
, whe
n such access is 
to be obt
ained
. 
  [
b. Separated Employees
.  [Appropriate campus guidelines shall include 
recommendations for exit procedures that include clear instructions 

regarding the disposition of employee electronic communications records 

subsequent to t
he employee™s separation from the University.  [ Employees 
shall be informed of these procedures upon employment. 
 Exit procedures shall include: 

Electronic Communications Policy
 Attachment 2: Implementation Guidelines
  [ University of California 
 Revised 
April 
7, 2011  [ 10  [conditions governing departmental access to the employee™s electronic 
communications subsequent to the employee
™s 
separation
. 
 instructions regarding disposition of personal electronic 

communications records, such as whether they should be deleted or 
transmitted to other personal email accounts or other personal media. 
 instructions if absence message must be install
ed, indicating 
separation
 date and contact information for departmental business. 
 date at which time the account will be terminated and not accessible to 

the former employee.
 Exit procedures shall identify intended reuse or disposal of electronic 

communica
tion
s resources and the electronic communications records 
stored on those resources upon employee separation. 
 In cases of involuntary separation, exit procedures shall include standard 

notification to be sent to employees.  [Such notification shall include: 
 conditions governing employee™s access to electronic communications 
resources during period of separation, including any arrangements to 
permit employee temporary access to obtain copies of personal 

electronic communications.
  [date when access to electron
ic communications will terminate.
  [c. Death
.  [Disposition of electronic communications of deceased individuals 
shall follow campus guidelines or protocols.  [In the absence of guidelines 

or protocols, advice of legal counsel shall be sought if requests for acc
ess 
to a former holder™s electronic communications records are received. 

 6.  [Monitoring of Access to Patient and Student Information Records.
 Patient and student information
 records
 are
 collected, stored, and accessed for 
business purposes only. Routine monitoring of access to 
institutional 

databases or other 
institutional 
collections of patient and student information 

records is a recommended information security practice and is not subj
ect to 
the nonconsensual access provisions of the Electronic Communications 

Policy, Section IV.B. 
 C. 
 PRIVACY OF SPECIFIC SERVICES
  [1. Telephone Transaction Records.
 Accounting procedures require billing 
records to be provided to University units and sub-units for review. Telephone 

transaction records document the use of University telephone equipment, 

including the number called and the time and length of the call. University 

units should advise employees who use University telephones for personal or 

other purposes that supervisors have access to records of all calls made from 

University telephones assigned to their use and that such records may be used 

for administrative purposes. 


Social Networking on the Internet 
Guide for UCSB Employees, Department
s, and Registered Organizations  [GENERAL  [Social networking Web sites or on-line communities, such as My Space, Facebook, and 
Flickr are being used increasingly by students to communicate with each other, and by 

universities to post events and 
profiles to reach students.  [
As part of the University of California, Santa Barbara™s commitment to building a community in which all persons ﬁcan work t
ogether in an atmosphere free of all forms of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation,ﬂ1 when using University electronic resources to access on-line social networks, University community members (academic and staemployees, students and others) 
are expected to act with honesty, integrity, and respect 

for the rights, privileges, pr
ivacy, sensibilities, and property
 of others.  [By doing so, individuals will be abiding by applicable laws, in
cluding copyright law, University policy, 

and the University™s Statement of Ethical Values.  [ ff  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [POSTING  [University Business Use 
 Only University employees authorized by their departments may use social networking Web sites to conduct University business.  [If authorized and in keeping with University 
policy, an employee may post on a social network profile: the University™s name, a University email address or University 
telephone number for contact purposes, or post official department information, resources, calendars, and events.  [For example a student health advocate or educator is charged with student outreach and education 
within their job description.  [Student Health Service may authorize these employees to use an on-line social network site to communicate with students and post University resources.  [
 Personal Use  [Consistent with the UC policy on Electronic Communications, personal use of University 
electronic resources to access social networking sites is to be limited to incidental use.  [Incidental use must not interfere with an individual™s performance of his/her assigned 
job responsibilities or someone else™s job performance or compromise the functionality of the department or campus network.  [ Individuals or groups within 
the University community are not permitted to present personal opinions in ways that imply endorsement by the University.  [If posted material may reasonably be construed as implying the support, endorsement, or opposition of the University with regard to any personal statements, incl
uding opinions or views on any issue, the material shall be accompanied 
by a disclaimer: an explicit statement that 
the individual is speaking for himself or herself and not as a representative of the University or any of its offices or units.  [(Use of the University™s Name and 
University of California Policies Applying to Campus Ac
tivities, Organizations, and Students, Section 41.12)  [An example of a disclaimer is as follows:  [
 1 Policy on Sexual Harassment and Complaint Resolution Procedures <

Page 2 of 3  [The contents, including all opinions and views expressed, in my 
profile [or on my page] are entirely personal and do not necessarily 
represent the opinions or views of anyone else, including other 

employees in my department or at the University of California.  [My department and the University of California have not approved and 
are not responsible for the material
 contained in this profile [or on this page].  [
The University™s name, University telephone 
numbers, University email addresses, and 
University images are not to be posted on social network profiles for academic and staff 
employees for personal purposes.  [However, an academic or staff employee, or student 
government officer, or registered campus organization may use their University title for identification purposes.  [If 
the use of the title might imply endorsement, support or opposition of the University with regard to any personal statements, including opinions 

or views on any issue, an explicit disclaime
r must appear proximate to the material.  [See disclaimer above. 
 RISKS Œ SPAM, SPYWARE, AND VIRUSES  [
 Many social networking sites collect profile information for advertising (SPAM) targeted at individuals with particular affiliations and 
interests.  [Use of the sites may increase 
SPAM to your email account.  [ 
 
In addition, from the social networking sites or links on social networking sites, your machine or network may be exposed to spyware and viruses that may damage your operating system, capture data, or otherwise compromise your privacy, your computer 

and the campus network, as well as affect others with whom you communicate.  [MONITORING  [The University of California, Santa Barbara 
doesn™t routinely monitor social networking sites, however, as with other electronic re
sources, University systems administrators 
may perform activities necessary to ensure the integrity, functionality and security of the University™s electronic resources.  [(UC El
ectronic Communications Policy, Section IV)  [
However, other employers,
 organizations, and individuals do monitor and share 
information they find on social networking 
Web sites.  [Posted information is public 
information.  [
 INVESTIGATIONS  [In response to concerns or complaints or information provided by individuals, University administrators may look up profiles on social networking sites and may use the 

information in informal or formal proceedings.  [
In addition, the University has no control over how other employers, organizations, or individuals may use information they find 
on social networking Web sites. 
 
Whether professionally or for incidental personal use, if you use social networking Web 
sites, please read the We Care Safety Tips.  [

President
 OverviewThis policy establishes that all information assets will be classified according to their confidentiality,
integrity and availability. 
This policy sets forth procedures based on those classifications so that the
university can protect each asset in an appropriate manner.
This policy is based on federal information processing standards (FIPS) publication 199, "
Standards for
Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems
" and the corresponding NIST
special publication, 800-53 revision 4, "
Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations
."Key elements of this policy are the appointment of data stewards and the classification of data elements
or data assets.
A.Security objectives
As part of the university's data classification scheme, data will be classified, in terms of security, as
B.
high, medium, or low in three areas:
Confidentiality
"Confidentiality" refers to the requirement and need for preserving authorized restrictions on
information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and
proprietary information. Examples include student social security numbers, which require a high
level of confidentiality; the contents of university work emails, which require a medium level of
confidentiality; and the university's "front door" web pages, which require a low level of
confidentiality.
1.Integrity
"Integrity" refers to the necessity of guarding against improper information modification or
destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. Student grades
and university financial data are examples of data that requires a high degree of integrity.
2.Availability
"Availability" refers to the requirement to ensure timely and reliable access to and use of
information. Medical information, such as an individual's potential allergic reactions to certain
drugs, is an example of data that has a requirement for a high degree of availability.
3.Potential impact
C.High
Failure to meet this particular security objective could pose a significant threat to: reputation,
university mission, intellectual properties, legal compliance, financial health, or life or liberty.
Information exempted from the "sunshine" laws usually has a high degree of confidentiality.
Information regarding grades, confidential or proprietary research, health care, or personal
financial information typically requires a high degree of integrity.
1.Medium
Failure to meet this particular security objective could pose a moderate threat to: reputation,
university mission, intellectual properties, legal compliance, financial health, or life or liberty.
Typically, items in this classification are subject to release under the "sunshine" laws.
2.Low
3.
Failure to meet this particular security objective could pose little or no threat to: reputation,
university mission, intellectual properties, legal compliance, financial health, or life or liberty.
A low degree of confidentiality is typically used for information that is intended for public
consumption.
Data stewards
The data steward is the individual whom the university has identified as being responsible for the
quality and utility of data elements. A primary duty of the data steward is to ensure that all data for
which the steward has responsibility is properly rated and classified. 
The data steward is responsible for
ensuring that a particular data element remains useful for the university, and that data is made
available to appropriate parties as defined by role.
A data steward must be identified for all data elements that have a medium or high potential impact.
The data steward works with Ohio university to ensure that the right policies, procedures, and operating
practices are in place to protect the data element.
D.University information security officer
The director of information security, fulfilling the role of university information security officer, is tasked
to coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information security program.
This includes responsibility for the overall information risk posture of the university, and ensuring that
the security objectives listed in this policy are adequately addressed.
E.Procedures for levels of data
All institutional data shall be rated according its criticality in the dimensions of confidentiality, integrity,
and availability. These ratings will occur over time, starting with those data elements that pose the
greatest risk to the university, or that have the greatest compliance requirements.
A list of data elements with their corresponding data classification ranking will be generated by the
information security office through collaboration with university parties, including at a minimum the
listed reviewers of this policy, and approved by the Ohio university president and executive staff. 
Those
officially classified data sets and guidance for the different levels of data, including notation and
suggested methods of protection will be included at 
https://www.ohio.edu/oit/security/consulting-
standards/classifying-sensitive-data
.The following policies apply to data elements at these particular levels. 
If a particular data element has
a combination of ratings, the highest rating will take precedence. 
Failure to adhere to the following shall
also be considered to be a violation of policy 
91.003 and may result in disciplinary action.
F.High
User roles or systems handling data with a high classification shall be reviewed and approved by
the appropriate data steward, information security office, and chief information officer on an
annual basis with appropriate input from interested parties throughout the university. Those
systems and business processes surrounding the data elements shall be reviewed prior to being
put into production, or containing sensitive information, and thereafter on an annual basis, by
1.
ReviewersProposed revisions of this policy should be reviewed by:
1. Chief Information Officer
2. Information Assurance and Privacy Advisory Group
3. DeansForms, References, and History
the information security office, to ensure that security controls are adequate.
Medium
User roles or systems handling data with a medium classification shall be reviewed and
maintained by the information security office, appropriate data steward, and supervisor or
department head as appropriate. Those systems and business processes surrounding the data
elements shall be reviewed on a periodic, sequential basis by the information security office, to
ensure that security controls are adequate.
2.Low
User roles or systems handling data with a low classification shall be reviewed and maintained by
the appropriate supervisor or department head as appropriate. Guidelines for best practices in
handling this classification of data will be provided by the information security office upon
request. A security review of systems with a low security rating will be done by the information
security office at the request of the department as time and resources allow.
3.Forms
There are no forms that are specific to this policy.

SCOPE
This policy applies to everyone using network services of Western Michigan
University, whether on campus, at regional sites, or remotely through other
internet service providers.
POLICY STATEMENTS
Network services and wiring may not be modified or extended beyond the
area of their intended use. This applies to all network wiring, hardware,
and jacks.
The network may not be used to provide Internet access to anyone outside
of the University community for any purposes. WMU-specific or
commercially obtained network resources may not be retransmitted
outside of the University community.
The network is a shared resource. Thus, network use or applications which
inhibit or interfere with the use of the network by others are not permitted.
(For example, using an IP address not registered to you, or applications
which use an unusually high portion of the bandwidth for extended periods
of time, thus inhibiting the use of the network by others, are not
permitted). Use of the network must comply with all University's policies.
Forgery or other misrepresentation of one's identity via electronic or any
other form of communication is a violation. Prosecution under State and
Federal laws may also apply.O!ice of Information Technology

However, remote access capabilities can addsecurity vulnerabilities because such services increase the number of access points thathackers can use to gain entry. It is critical that these access points be properly secured.Because many university organizations now permit the business use of computers that arenot owned by the university, the network perimeter has been extended to include thosecomputers. However, it should not be implied that this policy requires organizations to beresponsible for the installation, maintenance and support of computers and personaldigital assistants that are not owned by the university.(C)ScopeThe scope of this information technology policy includes university computer andtelecommunications systems and the employees, contractors, temporary persomlel andother agents of the university who use and administer such systems.This remote access policy does not apply to access to web enabled systems provided bythe university and designed for use and access from off campus (e.g. www.utoledo.edu,lnyut.utoledo.edu, email.utoledo.edu, files.utoledo.edu, etc.)(D) ProcedureVilÿual Private Network (VPN) as provided by the information technology is the onlymethod of obtaining remote access to internal university computing assets.

  [Acceptable Use of IT Resources 
(Network and Computing) Policy  [  [  [  [  [  [ Effective Date:
 July 1, 2007  [Policy Statement
 Columbia University requires that all indivi
duals accessing University electronic information 
resources to abide by the standards of accep
table usage indicated within this policy. 
 The University is not responsible for information or mate
rials residing on non-University systems or available over publicly accessible ne
tworks even if accessed via the University™s network.  [Such materials do not necessarily refl
ect the attitudes, opinions, or values of the 
University, its trustees, f
aculty, staff, or students.  [ The University reserves the right 
to modify or amend this policy a
nd to limit or restrict the use of 
its electronic information resources
 at its sole discretion.  [  [Reason for the Policy Columbia University™s network and compu
ting technology provides information, data, and 
communication services. Responsible use of electronic information resources is necessary to 
create and maintain an open community of responsible users based on mutual respect and 
cooperation, commitment to the integrity of 
resources and data, and compliance with all 
University policies and federal, state, and local statutes. 
 This policy defines acceptable usage of Columbia
 University network and computing resources. 
 Primary Guidance to Which This Policy Responds This policy is established under the provisions of Columbia University™s Information 
Technology Security and Policy Program. 
 Responsible University Office & Officer The office of Columbia University Informati
on Technology Security is responsible for the maintenance of this policy, and for responding to
 questions regarding this policy.  [The Chief Information Security Officer (CIS
O) is the responsible officer.  [Revision History This policy was established in July 2007.  [Who is Governed by This Policy This policy applies to all individuals who access, use, or 
control University electronic 
information resources.  [Those individuals covere
d include, but are not limited to staff, faculty, 
students, those working on behalf of the University, guests, tenants, visitors, and individuals authorized by affiliated institutions and organizations.  [
  [Who Should Know This Policy 
All individuals governed by this policy should be familiar with it. 
  [Acceptable Use of IT Resources Policy - final  [
  [Page 1 of 4 
  [Exclusions & Special Situations None  [Policy Text  [This policy establishes the expectations for all users of the University™s electronic information 
resources and data.  [It addresses the availability and integrity of resources in support of the 
University™s missions, codifies a
ppropriate usage, establishes the 
need for users to respect the 
rights of others and to be in compliance with 
other University policies, policies of external 
networks and resources, and all applicable federal, state, and local statutes. 
 The University™s electronic information resour
ces are provided to support the teaching, learning, 
clinical, and research missions of the Universi
ty and their supporting administrative functions. 
Inappropriate use of these electronic information resources threatens the atmosphere for the 
sharing of information, the free exchange of id
eas, and a secure environment for creating and maintaining electronic 
information resources. 
  [ Appendix A provides a partial list of relevant statues regarding use of electronic information 
resources.  [ Examples to assist with interpretation a
nd administration of this policy are provided 
in Appendix B - ﬁExamples of the Acceptable Use IT Resourcesﬂ at the end of this document
.  [Responsibilities  [General  [No University electronic information resour
ce may be used for a purpose that violates 
University statutes or regulations or for an illegal or criminal purpose. 
 Use of the University electronic informa
tion resources for commercial purposes, except where explicitly approved, are strictly prohibited. Prohibited uses include but are not limited to: development of programs, data 
processing or computations for commercial 
use, preparation and presentation of advertising material, or the running of a server 
connected to the Un
iversity network.  [ Many people use University systems and netw
ork for daily work; therefore, obstructing this work by consuming excessive amounts 
of system resources or by deliberately 
crashing the machine(s) will not be tolerate
d. Before running large jobs on a shared 
system, perform due diligence by contacting the 
administrator of the system to determine 
if the job is permitted and how to minimi
ze the impact. Network usage is continuously 
monitored and excessive use will 
be automatically restricted.  [
  [Copying, storing, displaying, or distributing copyrighted ma
terial using University systems or networks without the express permission of the copyri
ght owner, except as otherwise allowed under copyright laws, is prohibited. Under the Federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, repeat infr
ingements of copyright
 by a user can result in termination of the user's access to University systems and networks.  [
 Network use 
 The owner of any device connected to the network is responsible for the security of and 
traffic generated by that device. This includes any traffic, regard
less of origin, that travels through such a device.  [A device initiating 
or transmitting an attack on other systems

  [Page 2 of 4 
  [(e.g., having fallen victim to a virus, worm, or
 break-in) will be taken off the network immediately until it has been made secure.  [
 Unauthorized creation of any program, Web form, or other mechanism that asks for a 
Columbia user identity and password 
(e.g., UNI, CUNIX ID) is prohibited.  [  [No University network may be used as a ve
hicle to gain unauthorized access to other systems.  [
 Computing use  [Immediately report any systems, which contai
n information classified as confidential, 
that have been compromised to CUIT Secur
ity using the ﬁContactsﬂ information below. 
To preserve any evidence of tampering or 
misuse, do not use the 
system until a systems 
administrator has investigated the problem. 
 Computer accounts provide access to persona
l and confidential data. Therefore, individual accounts cannot be transferred to or used by another individual and sharing accounts or passwords is not permitted.  [
 Each user is responsible for the proper use of his or her account, protecting data, and any activity performed via their 
user account. Therefore, choose strong passwords and safeguard them, ensure that file protections 
are set correctly, and review last logon status (if available) to ensure your user account was not compromised.  [
 Unauthorized attempts to escalate privileges on a University system, or access to any 
account or system not belonging to you are not permitted.  [
 Report possible security lapse on any University system or network to the system 
administrators.  [
 The system administrators conduct periodic 
security checks of University systems and 
networks, including password checks. Any user found to have an easily guessed or compromised password is required to change 
his or her password during next login.  [ Any University system use by outside indi
viduals or organizations requires special permission from the system's administrator and 
payment of fees to the University and to 

the appropriate software vendors where applicable.  [ University computing facility use for playing computer games is
 strictly prohibited.  [Frivolous, disruptive, or inconsiderate conduct in computer labs
 or terminal areas is also 
strictly forbidden.  [Privacy and information / data protection 
 All private information (e.g., Social Security
 Numbers, credit information, passwords, 
etc) must be protected from 
unauthorized disclosure.  [  [Unauthorized attempts to read another pers
on's protected files or gain access to their 
computer are prohibited. 
 Local system administrators 
and providers of University electronic 
information resources 
and data have the additional responsibility of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and 

availability of the resources they are mana
ging.  [Persons in these positions are granted significant trust to use their privileges appropriately for their intended purpose and only when required to maintain the system. Any 
private information obtained in carrying out 
these duties must be treated in the strictest confidence. 
Acceptable Use of IT Resources Policy - final  [
  [Page 3 of 4 
  [ Local system administrators s
hould not override files protections unless necessary in the course of their duties, and must treat the contents of thos
e files as private information at 
all times. 
 Privacy Expectations  [User files or emails on central University systems are kept as private as possible. 
 The University respects the privacy of individuals and does not routinely monitor the content of the information passing through its 
network, data stored on its servers, or posted by individuals not acting in an official capacity.
  [However, to protect the integrity of its resources and the rights of all users, the University reserves the right to examine 
material stored on or transmitted through its re
sources if there is cause to believe that 
either a user violated the standards for 
acceptable computing use or a user gained 
unauthorized access to the University™s electronic information resources.  [
 There may be inadvertent inspection in the or
dinary course of ma
naging and maintaining 
the computer network and in carrying out othe
r day-to-day activities. However, user files on central University systems are kept with utmost privacy. 
 Enforcement Violations of these policies may result in th
e immediate suspension of computer account and 
network access pending investigation of circumstances and ma
y lead to their eventual 
revocation. Serious violations will be referred directly to the appropriate University or outside 
authorities. Unauthorized use of University computing facilities is a criminal offense. The 
penalties may be as severe as suspension or di
smissal from the University and/or criminal 
prosecution.  [Definitions  [Data is a stored collection of information th
at may include alphanumerics, words, sounds, 
symbols, or images.  [
 Electronic Information Resources
 include data, networks, computers, and other devices that store or display data, communications devices
, and software used on such devices.  [Contacts For questions or comments:

units who have purchased equipment outside of OIT
funding, or b) grant on-going maintenance access to faculty
or staff with specialized equipment.
7. Maintain all WAN data connections to the University.
8. Extend the Data Backbone. All requests to extend the
Data Backbone (e.g., IP tunneling, WAN connections, WAN
upgrades, etc.) must be forwarded to the University Network
Engineer.
B. Telecommunications Rooms
1. OIT exclusively manages University Telecommunications
Rooms.
2. Access to Telecommunications Rooms for non OIT staff
must be coordinated with OIT Telephone/Network Services.
C. Separate Networks
1. OIT must set up and maintain any college or departmentÕs
separate networks.
2. OIT is responsible for the protection of the University
network, but initial and ongoing costs of a separate network
will be the responsibility of the requesting academic or
auxiliary unit.
D. Services
1. IP Addresses
The Class B IP address block 132.178.0.0/16 and BSU-IPV6
block 2620:109:5000::/44 are the property of Boise State
University. The Network Engineer will manage the
addresses (numbers) and their use. The improper use of
University IP numbers is a violation this policy.
2. Dynamic Host ConÞguration Protocol (DHCP)
a) DHCP is a protocol that provides a means to

dynamically allocate IP addresses.
b) OIT is responsible for DHCP implementation and
service.
3. Domain Name System (DNS)
a) DNS is a general-purpose distributed and
replicated data query service chießy used on the
Internet for translating hostnames into Internet
addresses, as well as the style of hostname used
on the Internet (though such a name is properly
called a fully-qualiÞed domain name).
b) OIT is responsible for DNS service on the
Network.
4. Protocols
The only authorized routed protocol on the Boise State
University network is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP).
III. Wireless Guidelines
OIT will work with campus leadership to educate faculty, students and staff on
the shared responsibility of wireless access.
A. Access
1. The University provides wireless access to computing and
IT resources for employees, associates, students, and
guests as part of the services offered to enhance
productivity in the workplace. Wireless networks operate
within a shared and Þnite radio spectrum. OIT will maintain
administrative rights over this spectrum on campus and
remote University buildings to ensure fair and efÞcient
allocation of resources.
2. OIT will manage the RF spectrum and reserve speciÞc
20mhz wide 5ghz channels for use by non OIT departments
and vendors. Departments and vendors shall only use the
assigned channels.
3. The spectrum usage applies to all device trafÞc and
interference occurring in the following frequencies ranges:
a) 800 and 900 MHz, industrial, scientiÞc, and
medical (IS) bands, all modes
b) 2.21920-1930 MHz, all modes
c) 2.4-5 GHz, all modes
d) 4.9-6 GHz, all modes
B. Wireless Spectrum
1. OIT will grant, limit, or restrict access to the wireless
spectrum within the physical spaces and on grounds owned
and operated by Boise State University.
2. OIT will monitor the spectrum on a continuous basis, and
may regulate all wireless activities at all institution sites,
including remote ofÞces and common areas.
3. Should any device create harmful interference, OIT or
their designee may request immediate or cause deactivation
of the device until such time as it can be reactivated without
causing harmful interference.
C. Acceptable Usage
Access to wireless networks owned or operated by Boise State
imposes certain responsibilities and obligations and is granted subject

to University polices, and local, state, and federal laws. Acceptable
use of wireless networks includes, but is not limited to the following:
1. Respecting system security mechanisms, and not taking
measures designed to circumvent, ignore, or break these
mechanisms,
2. Showing consideration for the consumption and utilization
of IT resources, and
3. Assisting in the performance of remediation steps in the
event of a detected vulnerability or compromise.
D. Privacy Expectations
While the University respects usersÕ rights to privacy, the institution
cannot assure any level of privacy as stated in University Policy #
8000, Information Technology Use
(https://policy.boisestate.edu/information-technology/information-
technology-resource-use/) 
. Users are responsible for taking
reasonable measures to ensure their own privacy on the wireless
network.

 Glossary
  [I. Introduction
 Computers, network systems, and other associated technologies offer powerful tools for 
creating, 
communicating, and managing data, and for a host of other activities.  [Taxpayers, students, and other 
groups providing sources of funding that support information technology resources at the University expect 
that these assets will be used in sup
port of the University™s mission of instruction, research and other 
creative activity, and service.
  [The University expects all individuals using information technology resources to take appropriate measures 
to manage the data stored on technology resource
s.  [ The University is expected to preserve and protect 
administrative data transmitted and stored on its systems and comply with applicable federal and state 

legislation.
  [The University generally does not monitor or restrict the content of material trans
mitted, stored, or posted on 
University
-owned information technology resources , but reserves the right to limit or remove access to its 
networks and to material posted on its computers, when applicable University regulations, contractual 

obligations, or s
tate or federal laws are violated.  [Individuals who use University technology resources and 
email for any work
-related or personal matters do not acquire an absolute right of privacy for data, 
documents and communications transmitted or stored on Universit
y information technology resources
.  [II. Scope
 
 AR 10:1
 Page 
2 of 
9  [A. This policy applies to users of University information technology resources irrespective of whether those 
resources are accessed from on
-campus or off
-campus locations.  [Persons having the following 
affiliations with the University are eligible to access a
nd use the University™s information technology 
resources: 
  [1. Current faculty and staff, including post
-doctoral fellows; 
  [2. Currently enrolled students (including undergraduate, graduate, and non degree students);
  [
3. Upon request, retired faculty and 
staff, and their surviving spouses or sponsored dependents; 
  [4. Upon request, spouses or sponsored dependents of faculty or staff who become deceased while 
employed by the University; 
  [
5. Certain persons affiliated with external agencies collaborating with the University; and 
  [6. Any other person authorized by the Vice President for Information Technology or designee to use 
University information technology resources. 
  [An individual™s acc
ess to specific resources shall be limited due to University licensing or contract 
limitations.
  [For groups 3, 4, and 5, access is generally limited to electronic mail.  [If resources become constrained, 
this practice may be reviewed and may be restricted o
r eliminated in favor of allocating required 
resources to uses by active faculty, students, and staff.  [Unless eligible though another affiliation, alumni 

of the University are not eligible to access and use University information technology resources, exc
ept 
when such resources are available to the general public.  [
  [
B. This policy applies to all University information technology resources, including:
  [1. Data and other files, including electronic mail and voice mail, stored in individual computer accounts
 on University
-owned centrally
-maintained systems; 
  [2. Data and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail stored on departmentally
-maintained 
systems;  [
  [3. Data and other files, including electronic mail and voice mail, stored in individual co
mputer accounts 
on systems managed by the university on behalf of affiliated organizations; 
  [4. Data and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail, stored on personally
-owned devices on 
University property (e.g., residence hall rooms);
  [5. Data
 and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail stored on University
-owned systems 
assigned to a specific individual for use in support of job functions; and 
  [
6. Telecommunications (voice or data) traffic from, to, or between any devices describ
ed above
.  [ III. Confidentiality
  [A. In general, information stored on information technology resources is considered confidential, whether 

protected by the computer operating system or not, unless the owner intentionally makes that 
information available to other groups or individuals.  [The U
niversity assumes that individual users wish 
the information they store on central and campus shared information technology resources to remain 

confidential.  [Requests for disclosure of confidential information may be reviewed by the senior 

 AR 10:1
 Page 
3 of 
9  [administrator o
f the information technology systems involved.  [Such requests shall be honored only 
when approved by the University officials authorized by the University, or when required by state or 
federal law.  [Except when inappropriate or impractical, computer users 
shall receive prior notice of such 
disclosures.
  [B. Free expression of ideas is central to the academic process.  [The University acknowledges the 
importance of the diversity of values and perspectives prevalent in an academic institution, and is 
respectful
 of freedom of expression of ideas.  [The University does not condone censorship nor does it 
endorse the inspection of electronic files or monitoring of network activities related to individual 

activities. 
  [C. Legitimate reasons for persons other than the 
account holder to access computer files, computers, or

  [D. In any case where it becomes necessary for persons other than the account holder to access computer 
files or computers or network traffic for one or more of the purposes outlined above, all reaso
nable 
attempts shall be made to limit the access to the related purpose and to preserve confidentiality of any 

personal identifiers.
  [IV. Security
  [ A. Although the University takes reasonable measures to protect the security of its information technology 
resources and accounts assigned to individuals, the University does not guarantee absolute security.  [
  [
B. The University helps users of its central and
 campus shared information technology resources to protect 
the information they store on those resources from accidental loss, tampering, unauthorized search, or 
other access.  [In the event of inadvertent or non
-malicious actions resulting in the loss of o
r damage to 
information, or the invasion of the user™s identity or privacy, the University™s information technology 
department shall make a reasonable effort to mitigate the loss or damage.  [
  [C. The University provides industry
-standard security on Univer
sity maintained systems.  [Users are 
responsible for properly safeguarding the information technology resources under their control, specific 
to files associated with their computer accounts.  [
  [D. Users may request that arrangements be made to protect info
rmation stored on such resources.  [These 
requests may be honored at the discretion of the unit that manages the resources.

ulations, 
Code of Student Conduct, Human Resources Policy and Procedures, or Rules of the University Senate.  [
Incidental personal use is an accepted and appropriate benefit of being associated with the University™s 
technology environment.  [The senior manag
ement of each unit is authorized to determine the nature 
and amount of incidental personal use by members of the unit.  [An employee™s supervisor may require 
the employee to cease or limit any incidental personal use that hampers job performance, adversely 
affects or conflicts with University operations or activities, or violates University policy.  [All direct costs 
(for example, printer or copier paper and other supplies) attributed to personal incidental use shall be 
assumed by the user.
  [D. The user shall
 not use information technology resources for any individual commercial purpose or for 
personal gain, except as approved pursuant to other applicable University regulations, or approved by 

the Vice President for Information Technology, or a designee.

information storage space, printing facilities, or processing capacity, and 
interactive network connections.
  [ VI. System Administrator Responsibilities
 A. Both University and departmental system administrators of information technology resources are 
respo
nsible for the security of information stored on those resources, for making appropriate information 
on security procedures available to users of those systems, and for keeping those systems free from 
unauthorized access.  [Administrators of departmental an
d individual information technology resources 
shall not implement any policy or procedure that is less restrictive than University requirements.
  [
B. University and departmental system administrators are prohibited from removing any information from 
individ
ual accounts unless the system administrator finds that:
  [1. The presence of the information is illegal (e.g. copyrighted material, software used in violation of a 
license agreement, or child pornography);
  [
 AR 10:1
 Page 
5 of 
9  [2. The information in some way endangers Universi
ty information technology resources or the 
information of other users (e.g. a computer worm, virus, or other destructive program); or
  [3. The information is inappropriate because it is unrelated to or is inconsistent with the mission of the 
University, is 
in violation of University policy, or is otherwise not in compliance with the legal and 
ethical usage responsibilities listed in the Information Technology Usage Policy. 
  [4. Equipment is being transferred from one unit to another, or when equipment is dec
lared surplus.  [In

  [VII. Violations
  [A. Legitimate use of an information technology resource does not extend to whatever an individual is 
capable of doing with it.  [Just because an individual is able to circumvent 
restrictions or security, does 
not mean that the individual is permitted to do so.  [
  [Alleged violations of this policy can be reported directly to the Office of the Vice President for 
Information Technology. If the person responsible is not affiliated wit
h the University, or cannot be 
identified, the incident should be reported to 
itresourceabuse@uky.edu

622 622-1 (Rev. 2/21/08) 
Interim Acceptable Use Policy of Information Technology Resources 
California State University, Fresno  [
 1. Policy 
California State University, Fresno (University) is re
sponsible for overseeing the appropriate use of its 
information technology resources and requires individuals accessing and using the University™s 

resources to adhere to the rules for responsible and appropriate use of such resources. 
2. Reason 
The University encourages the use of information 
technology resources to share information and 
knowledge in support of its mission of education, 
research, public service, and to conduct the 
University's business.  [This policy provides a 
framework to promote and encourage responsible use 
of information technology resources. 
3. Scope  [
All staff, faculty, and students of the University, 
guests, auxiliary or
ganizations, third 
parties, and any 
other entities granted access or using any University
 information technology resource must adhere to 
this policy.  [
 Information technology resources (information resources) are devices or technologies that are 
designed, built, operated, organized, or maintained to 
process, store, transmit, or output information.  [
These information resources include, but are not 
limited to, voice, data and video networks, computer 
accounts, electronic communications, files, comput
ing facilities, laboratories, software, and data. 
4. Guiding Principles 
The University recognizes the principles of ac
ademic freedom and shared governance, freedom of 
speech, and privacy rights that hold important implicat
ions for the use of information resources.  [This 
policy reflects these principles within the context 
of the University's legal and other obligations.  [ 
 The University™s information reso
urces are provided for the use of 
students, faculty, administration, 
and staff, and to some extent to members of the wi
der community, in support 
of the programs of the 
university. All students, facult
y, administrators, staff, and thos
e members accessing resources are 
responsible for seeing that these information resources 
are used in an effective, efficient, ethical, and 
lawful manner. 
5. Rights and Responsibilities 
University information resources pr
ovide access to resour
ces on and off campus, as well as the ability 
to communicate worldwide.  [This open access is 
a privilege requiring individuals to use information 
resources responsibly.  [Access and use of informatio
n resources carries with it certain conditions and 
responsibilities.  [ Individuals shall respect the rights of other users, 
respect the integrity of the information resources 
and observe all applicable laws, regulations, execut
ive orders, collective bargaining agreements, 
policies, and contractual obligations.  [Individuals mu
st exercise care in acknowledging and respecting 
the work of others through stri
ct adherence to software licensing agreements and copyright laws. 
When accessing external resource
s to the University, individuals are responsible for abiding by any 
policies, rules, and codes of conduct applying to such resources. 
 
Individuals are responsible for the proper use of 
information resources assigned to them, including 
accounts, passwords, computers and data. Individual
s shall not knowingly falsely identify themselves 
and will take steps to correct misrepresentations 
if they have falsely or mistakenly identified 
themselves. 

622 622-2 (Rev. 2/21/08) 
Misuse of these resources or violation of the del
ineated conditions in this policy may result in the 
termination of the accounts and access, or, in cases 
of more serious infractions, the submission of 
the case to an appropriate disciplinary 
authority for further investigation.  [
 
Individuals should report any appar
ent violations of law, university policy, and college/school or 
department policy concerning the acceptable use 
of information resources to their appropriate 
university manager and/or the Chief Information Security Officer (see section 11). 
6. Privacy 
The University™s intent is to consider informatio
n and content as private a
nd confidential unless they 
have explicitly been made available to other authorized 
individuals.  [It is not the University™s practice 
to inspect, monitor or disclose the content of 
information stored on or transmitted through the 
University™s information resources.  [ 
 However, individuals should not expect privacy in
 their access and use of 
University information 
resources.  [As a practical matter, authorized 
individuals may access others™ information and/or 
electronic communication when necessary for the main
tenance and security of university information 
resources and services.  [When performing these functi
ons, every effort is made to ensure the privacy 
of an individual™s information.  [However, if viol
ations are discovered, they will be handled through 
normal university procedures. 

 Other causes for inspection, monitoring, and di
sclosure include the need to ensure operational 
effectiveness of resources and services; prevent or
 investigate a suspected breach of the law, this 
policy, or other University policie
s; or as part of an official Un
iversity disciplinary action, court 
enforced subpoena, search warrant, or valid requ
ests under the California Public Records Act. 
 
In addition, electronic communication is neither pr
ivate nor secure.  [In communicating via e-mail, 
instant messaging, or other forms, it is t
he individual and not the University, who assumes 
responsibility for its contents.  [All electronic messages may be subj
ect to discovery in civil litigation or 
in criminal investigations.  [In most instances, there is no reason for electronic messages to be 
retrieved by anyone other than the intended addressee,
 but in limited and appropriate circumstances 
(e.g., in course of an official investigation of wrongdoing), electronic communication may become 
subject to internal monitoring by an authorized individual. 
7. Copyright, Licensing, and Related Concepts 
Among other rights, copyright 
law, in general, gives the owner of a 
piece of literary or associated work 
(including, amongst other types of work, softwar
e, music, videos, games
, artistic works, and 
photographs) the right to prevent that work from un
authorized copying and distribution via any form.  [
As the University is subject to federal law, stud
ents, staff, faculty, and administrators must comply 
and abide with copyright law and Un
iversity copyright policy. 
 The concept of ‚fair use™ allows limited use of copy
right works for the purposes of research, private 
study, criticism and review; since the ‚fair use™ te
st is qualitative rather
 than quantitative, the 
prospective individual may need to check 
with the copyright owner before use. 
 
This means that most information and software is subj
ect to copyright and/or restrictions on its use.  [
Each individual must respect this copyright 
and must comply with published usage restrictions 
relating to any program, information, image, web pag
e, or other material.  [Any individual who installs 
software and/or information on University resources 
must ensure full compliance with any relevant 
copyright requirements and licensing agreements. 

622 622-3 (Rev. 2/21/08) 
8. Legal Requirements 
Law prohibits the unauthorized access, modificati
on, interference, or disruption of information 
resources, the harassment of individuals via electronic methods, and other inappropriate actions 
involving the use of information resources
1.  [Violations of law may be subject to penalties under civil 
or criminal code.  [University policies on sexual
 or other forms of harassment apply fully to all 
information resources, including electronic communication and the Internet. 
 University information re
sources shall never be used for purpos
es intended to incite or commit a 
crime; for example, it is illegal to post a credit 
card number, copyrighted information, or a computer 
password.  [Criminal and illegal use may include obscenity, child pornography, threats, harassment, 
theft, and unauthorized access.  [
 University information re
sources such as electronic communica
tion (e.g. e-mail, voice mail, instant 
messaging, etc.) are provided for university-relate
d activities.  [Fraudulent, harassing, or obscene 
messages and/or materials are not to be printed, s
ent, or stored.  [No e-mail or message shall be 
created or sent, nor Web pages created, that may cons
titute intimidating, hostile, or offensive material 
based on gender, race, color, religion, national or
igin, sexual orientation, or disability.  [The 
University™s policies on se
xual or other forms of harassment a
pply fully to electronic communication 
and the Internet.  [
 The following acts are relevant to use of informati
on resources in a university setting.  [Violations may 
incur sanctions by the University and/or legal procee
dings.  [Examples of violations, given below, are 
not intended to cover all eventualities: 
 a. Knowingly gaining or attempting to gain unauthorized access to any information resource, 
program, or information that the individual
 has no authorization to access or use. 
b. Intentionally gaining or attempting to
 enable inappropriate levels of access. 
c. Sharing the user name and password of his/her
 account without authorization and the explicit 
agreement by each party (lender and borrower). 
d. Unauthorized modification or access to any pr
ogram, file, data, electronic communication, or 
other computer material belonging to another individual or organization.  [
e. Using information resources to impersonate, 
harass, threaten, or ot
herwise cause harm to 
other individuals or organizations. 
f. Intentionally transmitting any computer 
virus, worm, or other malicious software. 
g. Taking actions threatening the security or ca
pacity of information re
sources or which modify, 
destroy, damage, or overload these resources. 
h. Violating any applicable law, university policy,
 executive order, or 
contractual obligation. 
9. Prohibited Use 
The University is a not-for-profit, tax-exempt or
ganization and is subject to applicable federal and 
state laws and regulations on the use of University 
property.  [Any use of information resources in a 
manner that places the University 
in jeopardy of such status is pr
ohibited.  [University information 
resources shall not be used for non-University co
mmercial purposes, except as permitted under 
University policy or with appropriate approval.  [

 University information resources (e.g., computer facili
ties, laboratories, offices,
 the library, etc.) do not 
provide a private environment for accessing electroni
c communication or other resources.  [Therefore, 
individuals are advised to be aware of
 their responsibilities for appropriate behavior in public places.  [
Some materials, which may be appropriate for scholarly inquiry in various disciplines, may be seen to 
have a strong possibility of creating a hostile en
vironment for other stu
dents, faculty, staff, and 
visitors. 
  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [1 Reference California Penal Code 502 & 18 U.S.C. § 1030
 
622 622-4 (Rev. 2/21/08) 
University information resources 
shall not be used to imply University endorsement, including the 
support or opposition of the University with regard 
to any religious or political activity or issue. 
University resources shall not be used for mass 
messaging to newsgroups, bulletin boards, mailing 
lists,, or other individuals.  [Individuals shall not impl
y University endorsement 
of products or services 
of a non-University entity from a University inform
ation resource, without approval.  [Individuals shall 
not give the impression that they 
are representing, giving opinions or
 otherwise making statements on 
behalf of the University unless authorized to do so
.  [To avoid this, individuals may use a disclaimer 
such as "The opinions or statements express
ed herein should not be taken as a position of or 
endorsement by California St
ate University, Fresno."  [
University resources s
hall not be used to store, distribute, or 
transmit obscene or offensive material.  [
No individual may hold in files (or Web pages), or transmit electronically, information, which 
constitutes obscene or offensive material.  [In this 
context, the individual is responsible for the content 
of his/her files, Web pages and messages. Any 
such data received involuntarily, e.g., through 
electronic mail, should be deleted.  [
These aforementioned restrictions might not prohibit such access 
or retention of such materials if they ar
e being used for a specific academic purpose. 
10. Incidental Use 
Information resources are owned and operated by the 
University and/or its various schools, colleges, 
departments, auxiliary organizati
ons, programs, recognized stu
dent and campus organizations, and 
are to be used for university-related activities and 
occasional incidental use.  [Such resources are 
provided to facilitate a person's 
essential work as an employee, st
udent, or other role within the 
University.  [Individuals may use University informat
ion resources for occasion
al incidental personal 
purposes of a private nature if such use does not: 
 a. Interfere with the University's ope
ration of its information resources. 
b. Burden the University with noticeable incremental costs. 
c. Interfere with a person's employment 
or other obligations to the University. 
d. Constitute or result in financial gain. 

e. Involve accessing, creating, downloading, or 
disseminating any information that a reasonable 
person would deem inappropriate, such as pornography or racist materials. 
f. Violate any applicable
 law, university policy, executive or
der, or contractual obligation. 
11. Reporting 
Suspected violations of this policy should be reported electronically at 
security@csufresno.edu
 or to 
the  [ Chief Information Security Officer 
 Information Technology Services 
 2225 East San Ramon Avenue 

 Mail Stop MF93 
 Fresno, CA. 93740-8029 
 Phone: (559) 278-3923 
12. Enforcement 
Federal and state laws and University policies in 
some cases apply specifically to the use of 
information resources.  [In other cases, they ma
y apply generally to personal conduct in which the use 
of information resources is incidental.  [Viol
ations of law may be referred for legal action. 
 Violations of provisions in this policy will be handl
ed through normal University procedures.  [Violators 
may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion under applicable 

University policies and collective bargaining agreements.  [ 
 Cases of more serious infractions 
will be submitted to an appropriat
e disciplinary authority for further 
investigation. In such cases, because different
 laws, policies, and procedures govern appropriate 
actions involving students, faculty, administrators
, or staff, any appropriate 
actions must follow the 
appropriate procedures (for ex
ample, the various collective bargaining agreements governs 
appropriate actions involving faculty and staff 
members and specifies specific procedures). 

622 622-5 (Rev. 2/21/08) 
The University reserves the right to terminate, 
suspend, and/or limit access to its information 
resources when policies or laws are violated and 
to use appropriate means to ensure continued 
service delivery at all times, 
preserve network/system integrit
y, and safeguard its information 
resources.

Security Awareness and Acceptable Use
Policy
Overview
The computing resources at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) support the educational, instructional,
research and administrative activities of the University and the use of these resources are a privilege
extended to members of the University community. As a user of these services and facilities, users have
access to valuable University resources, to sensitive data, and to internal and external networks.
Consequently, users of UNR computing resources are expected at all times to behave in a responsible,
ethical and legal manner.
Purpose

This Security Awareness and Acceptable Use Policy establishes specific requirements for the use of all
computing and networking resources at UNR. Individuals found to be in violation of this Acceptable Use
Policy may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the University's applicable disciplinary
policies.Users are also required to follow all federal, state and local laws governing information security and use of
computing resources, and to follow the University's Information Security Policies and Procedures (ISPP).
Scope
This policy applies to all users of computing resources owned or managed by UNR. Individuals covered
by this policy include, but are not limited to: employees, students, contractors, vendors, third parties and
guests accessing services through UNR's resources.
Computing resources includes all University owned, licensed, or managed hardware or so
!ware, and use
of the University network via a physical or wireless connection, regardless of the ownership of the
computer or device connected to the network.
These policies apply to technology administered in individual departments, the resources administered
by Information Technology, personally owned computers and devices connected by wire or
 wirelessly
 tothe campus network, and to o
"
-campus computers that connect remotely to the University's network.
Policy
Acceptable Use
1. You may only use the computers, accounts, and files for which you have been granted authorization
to use.
2. The University is bound by contractual and license agreements respecting third party resources; you
are expected to comply with all such agreements while using UNR's resources.
3. You must make reasonable e
"
ort to protect your passwords/credentials and to secure resources
against unauthorized use or access. You must configure hardware and so
!ware in a way that
reasonably prevents unauthorized users from accessing UNR's network and computing resources.
4.  [You must comply with the policies and guidelines for any specific set of resources to which you
have been granted access. When other policies are more restrictive than this policy, the more
restrictive policy takes precedence.
5. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of systems

and/or equipment. In the absence of such policies, in accordance with NRS 281A.400 limited use for
personal purposes is allowable if the use does not interfere with the performance of an employee's
duties, the cost and value related to use is nominal, and the use does not create the appearance of
impropriety or of endorsement by the University or Nevada System of Higher Education. If there is
any uncertainty, employees should consult their supervisor or manager.
 Security1. Users with access to data contained on UNR's systems that is classified as Confidential or Regulated
must take all necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized access to this information. Examples of
Confidential or Regulated Data include but are not limited to Federal Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA), Graham Leach
 Bliley
 Act (GLBA), proprietary, Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry (PCI), and confidential research data.
2.  [Employees should secure their workstations by logging o
" or locking when the host will be
unattended.
3.  [Because information contained on portable devices is especially vulnerable, special care should be
exercised. Protect laptops in accordance with current security standards, including personal
firewalls.
4.  [Postings by employees from a UNR email address to newsgroups should contain a disclaimer
stating that the opinions expressed are strictly their own and not necessarily those of UNR, unless
posting is in the course of business duties.
5.  [All hardware used by the employee that is connected to the UNR network, whether owned by the
employee or by UNR, shall be continually executing approved virus- scanning so
!ware with a
current virus database.
6.  [Employees must use extreme caution when opening e-mail attachments received from unknown
senders, which may contain viruses, e-mail bombs, or Trojan horse code and/or may be considered
"phishing".
 Prohibited Actions
The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions
during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration sta
" may have aneed to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).
Under no circumstances is a user of UNR computing resources authorized to engage in any activity that is
illegal under local, state, federal or international law while utilizing UNR- owned or managed resources.

18.  [Sending of messages that violate any applicable University or Nevada System of Higher Education
policy. Unauthorized use, or forging, of email header in formation, or impersonation of
another person's email account.
 Privacy
While the University desires to provide a reasonable level of privacy and does not generally monitor or
limit content of information transmitted on the campus network, it reserves the right to access and review
such information under certain conditions. These include the following: investigating performance
deviations and system problems (with reasonable cause), determining if an individual is in violation of
this policy, as may be authorized by other University or NSHE policy, or, as may be necessary to ensure
that UNR is not subject to claims of institutional misconduct.
1.  [For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within UNR may monitor
equipment, systems and network tra
"ic at any time. UNR reserves the right to audit networks and
systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy.
2. In the event of a legal proceeding or as otherwise authorized by the President of the University (or
designee), under the advisement of the O"ice of General Counsel, Information Security reserves the
right to access and inspect stored information without the consent of the user when the information
is stored within UNR computing resources.
3. As a public agency, UNR is subject to Public Records requests (Nevada Revised Statutes chapter
239). Users that have University records contained in their personal email accounts or on personal
devices are responsible for furnishing such information when requested under these laws.

Principles:
 
The University has chosen to adopt the policy principles established in the National 
Institute of Standards (NIST) 800 series of publicati
ons, and this policy is based on 
those guidelines.
 
The Chancellor or equivalent at each Campus must designate an individual or functional 
position responsible for information security at their Campus (Position of Authority 
and/or Campus Authority). The 
individual or position should be at a high enough 
organizational level to allow him/her to speak with authority on and for the Campus.
 
Each Campus must develop or adopt and adhere to a program which demonstrates 
compliance with this policy and related stan
dards. This program is the responsibility of 
the Position of Authority.
 
A Campus may apply more stringent requirements than those documented in this policy 
provided they do not conflict with or lower the standards or requirements established by 
this or any
 
other University policy.
 
Each User of University resources is required to be familiar and comply with University 
policies. Acceptance of this policy is assumed if a User accesses, uses, or handles 
University resources.

ACCOUNTABILITY/APPLICABILITY:
 
 
This standard applies to all 
technology
 
and systems that are technically
 
and logically capable of 
supporting the standard.
  [
This includes but is not limited to:  [university owned desktop 
computers,
 
laptops, cel

STANDARDS
 
STATEMENT:
 
 
Passwords are the most frequently utilized form of authentication for accessing a computing 
resource.  [Due to the use of weak passwords, the proliferation o
f automated password
-
cracking 
programs, and the activity of malicious hackers and spammers, they are very often also the 
weakest link in securing data.  [Greater risks require a h
eightened level of protection.  [
Passwords 
must therefore follow the 
standards 
listed below.
  [
 
 
Consult with the UCF Information Security Office if questions arise regarding the compliance of 
a system
 
with regard
 
to any of the following standards.
 
 
STANDARDS
:

pets, etc.
)
, 
birthdates
,
 
or other personal information such 
as 
an 
address 
or telephone 
number.
 
d.
 
Passwords should also not contain
 
three or more consecutive characters from 
an 

username (e.g., Joe Smith with use

bit industry accepted encryption (e.g., 
Advanced Encryption Standard [AES], Blowfish)
 
b.
 
Passwords in transit should be encrypted via TLS
 
protocol
.
 
 
4.
 
The same password should not be used for access 
that is
 
external to UCF (e.g., online 
banking, 
personal email accounts, personal desktop and/or laptop computers
, etc.)
 
 
5.
 
Systems
 
should 
observe these 
password 
age and history standards
 
via technical controls:
 
 
a.
 
Maximum password age should be no more than 60 days.
 
b.
 
Activate p

Information Technology
Data, Video and Voice Networks
Policy
 PURPOSEThe purpose of this rule is to ensure the integrity of the video, voice, and data
communication systems on the WMU campuses.
SCOPE
This rule applies to the UniversityÕs Kalamazoo campus facilities (main
campus, Parkview campus, and Oakland Drive campuses) and to the regional
site facilities, except for those regional sites that obtain network services from
another institution. These systems include the Ethernet network,
which consists of the data ports, the wiring for the system, thousands of
wireless access points and hundreds of network switches and routers
necessary for the system to operate. It also includes the traditional and voice
over-internet telephone system and the video system popularly known as
EduCablePOLICYThe Office of Information Technology is the office on campus that manages
and owns the video, voice, and data networks. All changes to this system
must be authorized by the Office of Information Technology and must be
implemented by IT staff or by licensed contractors working under IT
supervision.
No devices with multiple network interfaces may be connected to the
network without advance approval from the Office of Information
Technology. To obtain more information or request advance approval,

an IT service request
. You will be taken to ITDirect and asked to login with
your Bronco NetID and password.
No other office on campus is authorized to install new data ports, telephone
jacks, or video connections.
No other office on campus may connect hubs, switches, routers or wireless
access points to the network.
No other office on campus is authorized to change the location or
configuration of any network equipment.
No other office on campus is authorized to run any wire or fiber connection
to add new devices to the network, other than cable that connects directly
to an already existing wall-mounted data port, telephone jack, or video
jack.
No other office on campus may utilize information technology video, voice
and data network services to subscribe to, or connect to, television services
from an outside entity. All subscriptions and connections must be made
through the Office of Information Technology.
Any office found to be in violation of this policy will be financially
responsible for costs associated with their actions, including costs
associated for repair or replacement of damaged equipment and costs for
IT staff time spent on recovery. OIT will not be responsible for maintaining
network connectivity for any devices installed in violation of this rule.
RATIONALE
The video, voice, and data network is a highly complex system and it is
essential that all components of the system work together. Only if this system
is centrally managed and centrally owned can we have any assurance that all
parts of the network are installed to code, are installed to University network
standards, and are able to operate together. This policy is also necessary
because the telecommunications budget at Western is self-supporting and all
who use the network should share in the costs on the same basis.

Winthrop University Policy
on the Appropriate Use of
Information Technology
Resources
1 Introduction
The Winthrop University community understands that information
technology has become an integral resource in ful
"lling our mission of
teaching, learning, research, public service, and administrative
responsibilities. The University therefore encourages students, faculty,
and sta
!
 to acquire computer literacy and technological skill. Computers
and networks empower us openly to 
"nd, consider, and disseminate
information developed at Winthrop and elsewhere, to communicate and
collaborate with others near and far, and to build the technological skills
base on which the twenty-
"rst century depends. With this
empowerment, however, comes commensurate responsibility. Each of
us is obliged to support and abide by the ethical and legal standards
that apply to information technology, including rights of authorship,
con
"dentiality, privacy, and dissemination. In doing so, we respect the
codes of honesty, integrity, and intellectual freedom upon which
institutions of higher learning rely.
In A Vision of Distinction
, the Winthrop community was challenged to "ensure
that information technology resources are used e
!
ectively and e
#ciently in
support of the mission, goals, and objectives of the University. Information
technology resources at Winthrop will conform to national and international
standards...." To meet this challenge, the Appropriate Use Policy has been
developed in consultation with faculty, students, sta
!
, and administrative
o
#cers of the University, taking into consideration applicable legal standards,
state policy, guidelines from respected professional organizations, and the
policies developed by leading public and private universities throughout the
United States. In putting forth this policy, we intend to establish a framework
of responsible, considerate, and ethical behavior expected by the University in
the use of information technology
2 Policies

It is the policy of Winthrop University to respect the ownership of all
intellectual material protected by copyright laws.
Users shall not make or use illegal copies of copyrighted materials, store such
copies on University systems, or transmit them over University networks.
For further information relating to the copyright policies of Winthrop
University,
refer to the Winthrop University 
Policy on Copyrighted
 Material, available in
the library.
2.3 Systems Security
Compliance with policies that ensure the security and integrity of all campus
information systems is mandatory and critical to ensure continuing provision
of computer resources to the entire Winthrop community.
2.3.1 User Accounts
The University owns the computer facilities, resources, and accounts.
Information Technology and its respective departments must approve all
access to central computer systems, including the issuing of passwords.
Access to administrative systems is limited and must be obtained through the
appropriate Systems Security O
#cer. The department chair or an authorized
representative must approve all access to departmental computer systems.
All Winthrop students, faculty members, sta
!
, and employees of contracted
auxiliary services are eligible to receive a computer system account.
Members of employees' families, who are not members of one of the above
categories, are not eligible for computer system accounts.
Only the Assistant Vice President for Computing and Information Technology
may grant others access to Winthrop University electronic resources and then
only in those cases where there is a strong likelihood that the activity will
signi"cantly bene
"t the University as a whole.
Users shall not provide false or misleading information to obtain access to
computing resources or facilities.
2.3.2 Responsibility for security of accounts
An account is given to an individual for the exclusive use by that individual. It
is against University policy for a user to give someone his or her password or
allow others to use his or her account. However, this is not to preclude others
temporarily assisting a user in the performance of his or her university
functions (for example faculty helping a student with a computer project;
associates showing a new feature of the computer system) while supervised
by the user. Users are responsible for all activity on their accounts.
Attempting to discover another user's password or attempts to gain
unauthorized access to another person's 
"les or mail is prohibited. The only
exception will be when computer center personnel are working on the
security of the computer system.
2.3.3 Circumvention of network security
Users shall not attempt to circumvent or subvert system or network security
measures.
2.4 Con
!dentiality and privacy
2.4.1 Con
!dentiality
Winthrop University considers 
"les (for example: class programs and
assignments, spreadsheets, E-mail, etc.) to be con
"dential, and all users are
expected to treat them as such. Files may be shared with others by explicitly
making those "les available to them. It is against University policy to access

another person's 
"les without permission from the owner of those 
"les.Winthrop University personnel will not read the E-mail or 
"les of a user with
the following exceptions when: (a) it is necessary to diagnose a computer
system problem, (b) the University has probable cause to believe a violation of
University policy or applicable law has occurred, (c) the University is
complying with a valid subpoena or search warrant issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
2.4.2 Noti
!cation
Unless noti
"cation would hinder an investigation of adherence to this
appropriate use policy or would compromise a criminal investigation, a user
will be noti
"ed when his or her E-mail or 
"les will be read or have been read
by University o
#cials.2.4.3 Interception of network tra
"cUsers shall not intercept network tra
#c for any purpose unless engaged in
authorized network administrative duties.
2.5 Appropriate and inappropriate uses
2.5.1 Damage or disruption
Users may not damage computer systems or knowingly cause disruptions in
its operations or use. Users shall not use the network to disrupt network users,
services or equipment. Disruptions include, but are not limited to, distribution
of unsolicited advertising, propagation of computer "worms" and viruses, and
sustained high volume network tra
#c that substantially hinders others in their
use of the network.
2.5.2 Personal Gain
Users shall not use the computer systems for personal gain such as selling
access to a USERID or by performing work for pro
"t with University resources
in a manner not authorized by the University.
2.5.3 ConsultingUsers wishing to use University computing resources for consulting related to
their academic specialty shall obtain advance written approval from their
dean or equivalent supervisor in consultation with the Assistant Vice President
for Computing and Information Technology.
2.5.4 Excessive use
Users shall refrain from monopolizing systems, overloading networks with
excessive data or wasting computer time, connect time, disk space, printer
paper, manuals or other resources.
2.5.5 Nonessential use of laboratory resources
Because public University computer laboratory resources are limited,
nonessential use of these resources is discouraged. When others are waiting
for computer laboratory resources to complete class assignments, they may
preempt people using resources for nonessential purposes.
2.5.6 Billable services
Users shall assume responsibility for any charges associated with billable
services unless appropriate authorization has been obtained.
2.5.7 Electronic Mail
Electronic mail is a service provided by the University to users as an aid to

communication.
2.5.7.1 Acceptable uses of electronic mail
2.5.7.1.1 Uses of Electronic Mail
Electronic mail may be used for a wide variety of on- and o
!
-campuscommunication. Examples include subscriptions to listservs, professional
communications, notices of University activities, personal correspondence,
actions and scheduling of University and faculty committees, administration
and board activities, announcement of University policies and schedules, and
University announcements.
2.5.7.1.2 System-Provided Mailing Lists
Only messages relating to University activities should be sent to the system-
provided mailing lists, e.g., All Users, All Faculty, All Sta
!
, etc. Such mailing
lists are for noti
"cation of University events, communication of o
#cialUniversity messages, and noti
"cation of bulletin board discussions. System-
provided mailing lists shall not be used for "classi
"ed ads" (e.g., "For Sale," "For
Lease," etc.) or "free items" (e.g., free kittens, free books, etc.). Users shall not
use the system-provided mailing lists for commercial or partisan political
purposes.2.5.7.1.3 Bulletin Board System
As an alternative to the use of system-wide mailing lists, the University
provides a bulletin board system as a forum for discussion of issues,
announcements of activities, "classi
"ed ads," and communications that are
inappropriate for distribution by system-provided mailing lists. To assure the
most economical use of computer resources and to avoid sending messages
to persons who do not want to receive them, users are encouraged to use the
bulletin board system when they wish to communicate to the campus at
large.
2.5.7.1.4 User-created Mailing Lists
Users may also create their own mailing lists. When creating and using a
mailing list, users shall ensure that everyone on the list agrees to be included
on the list.2.5.7.2 Unacceptable uses of Electronic Mail
2.5.7.2.1 Prohibited uses
Electronic mail is not to be used for the following:
commercial ventures
personal pro
"tsolicitations for contributions for non-University sponsored entities
chain letters
"pyramid schemes"
or any illegal activity or unlawful purpose.
2.5.7.2.2 Harassment and intimidation
Users shall not use E-mail to harass or intimidate another person.
2.5.7.2.3 "Sensitive" information
No memos containing "personnel-sensitive" or "legal-sensitive" information
shall be sent via E-mail.
2.5.8 Intellectual freedom

Winthrop University recognizes the right of all users to use resources of their
choosing. Computer resources are available for the interest, information, and
enlightenment of the Winthrop community. Information will not be proscribed,
censored, or removed by the University because of partisan or doctrinal
disapproval.
2.5.9 Respect for rights of others
Computer users at Winthrop have a responsibility to be aware of materials
that may be objectionable to others when using computer facilities in public
areas. Monitors and printers in public areas, such as open access computer
labs and o
#ces that more than one person may share, should not be used to
display or print materials that might be de
"ned as harassing or disruptive.
Users are reminded that any state and federal laws dealing with these or
related matters apply to Winthrop facilities and are encouraged to use good
judgment.

9.1.1.A
 Data Classification 
and Data Types
  [ Data Classification and Data Types
  [The university utilizes v
arious
 data 
types
. Data types with similar 
levels of 
risk 
sensitivity
 are grouped together
 into data classifications.
 Four 
data classifications
 are 
used by the university
: Export Controlled
, Restricted
, Controlled
 and 
Public
. The 
Data T
rustee is ultimately responsible for deciding how to classify their data 
(see 
Roles and Responsibilities
 for list of D
ata Truste
es and additional information
).  [ On a periodic basis, it is important to re
-evaluate the classification of university data 
to ensure the assigned classification is still appropriate based on changes to legal 
and contractual obligations as well as changes 
in the use of the data or its value to 
the uni
versity. This evaluation must 
be conducted by the appropriate Data Trustee.
 Conducting an evaluation on an annual basis is 
recommend
ed; 
however, the Data 
Trustee must
 determine 
the 
frequency
 that
 is most appropriate based on
 need.
 If a 
Data Trustee determines that the classification of a certain data set has changed, an 
anal
ysis of security controls must
 be performed to determine whether existing 
controls are consistent with the new classification
. If gaps are found in existin
g security controls, they must
 be corrected in a timely manner, commensurate with 
the level of risk presented by the gaps.
 If you have any questions related to 
classification of data, please contact the IT@UC Office of Informa
tion Security (OIS) 
at 
513-558-ISEC (4732)
 or 
 infosec@uc.edu
.  [Data Types
  [The University of Cincinnati has defined four 
Data Types and created a data 
classification for each university data: 
Export Controlled

INTRODUCTION
 
(Purpose and Intent)
 
It is the policy of the 
University of South Florida System (University/USF) that all information 
utilized in the course of business, research, and education is considered an asset, and as such, 
administration, faculty, staff, and students are responsible and accountable for its v
iability and 

security and integrity of confidential information that is transmitted, stored or maintained using 
information technology resources through th
e appropriate legal, auditable controls that will protect 
the information from unauthorized access, intentional or accidental disclosure, modification, 
destruction, denial of service, or misappropriation of data or hardware.
 
The purpose of this policy is t
o define the overall information security structure which will insure 
the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of all critical University data and information systems.  [
Components of that structure may be found by reference to individual University
 
organizational 
units.  [Due to the continued proliferation and distribution of computing and information systems 
across the entire University, an effective structure must be distributed and a consistent program for 
addressing security is required.
 
This pol
icy establishes the organizational structure and processes applicable to the University of 
South Florida System to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding the 
security and confidentiality of information that is transmitted, store
d, maintained; or otherwise 
utilized information technology resources.
 
 

II. 
SCOPE
 
This policy will apply at all University of South Florida System locations and to information and 
systems when used remotely from University locations.
 
III. 
STATEMENT OF POLI
CY
  [
 
 
A.
 
Information Security Manager (ISM)
 
The Information Security Manager is responsible for University
-
wide efforts related to data and 
information system security, such as development of USF data security policies, negotiation and 
evaluation of site 
licenses for security
-
related software, training, coordination of efforts to improve 
data security controls, and dissemination of security
-
related information and incidents, which could 
affect the availability, and integrity of computing resources on campu
s.
 
When security issues with a particular University computing resource arise in such manner that 
threaten the integrity and availability of the University computing infrastructure, the ISM, under 
advice of the other members of the Incident Response Team, 
has the authority and responsibility to 
isolate the offending computing resource until the issue has been resolved.
 
The ISM will maintain communications with the Information Security Officers and Administrators, 
regularly educating and updating them on inf
ormation security issues that may need to be addressed.
 
B.
 
Information Security Workgroup (ISW)
 
The Information Security Workgroup is the steering committee responsible for recommending 
policies and assisting in the overall coordination of the University i
nformation security program.  [It 
will advise the Information Security Manager on the development and maintenance of standards and 
guidelines that will direct the Information Security Officers in their role.  [The Information Security 
Workgroup will also ass
ist the Information Security Manager on evaluating risk analysis surveys 
completed by individual University units.
 
The ISW is responsible for incorporating methods for a systematic, University
-
wide, risk assessment 
framework through which appropriate chang
es in policy, standards, and guidelines will be 
implemented and enforced.  [This framework will be continuously re
-
evaluated to respond to 
developing information security issues. The results of this risk assessment will be submitted to the 
Information Techn
ology Management Council (ITMC) with enough supporting information to 
allow the ITMC to make a decision on the acceptable level of risk for the University.
 

The Information Security Workgroup will be chaired by the Information Security Manager.  [Its 
members
hip will be reviewed and updated as appropriate and published in the USF Security 
Website, 
http://www.usf.edu/it/services/data
-
security.aspx
.
 
C.
 
Incident Response Team (IRT)
 
The primary goal
 
of the Incident Response Team is to protect the overall computing infrastructure 
of the University.  [The team is responsible for quickly identifying threats to the campus data 
infrastructure, assess the level of risk, and immediately take steps to mitigat
e the risks considered 
critical and harmful to the integrity of University information system resources. IRT members will 
notify local Information Security Officers and Administrators of any incident involving their 
resources.
 
Members of the Incident Respo
nse Team should be notified as soon as an incident is detected 
within the University.  [After control is restored, a report must be presented to all members of the 
IRT and local administration, clearly outlining the extent of the breach, and the steps taken
 
to avoid 
future incidents.  [These incidents will be reviewed by the ISM as part of the continuous risk 
assessment program.
 
Members of the IRT will perform localized vulnerability assessment as needed and report their 
findings to the appropriate local Info
rmation Security Officer and Information Security 
Administrator.  [IRT members will also conduct University
-
wide vulnerability assessments during 
emergency situations, in order to protect the integrity and availability of the University 
infrastructure, and 
take actions as deemed appropriate.
 
The Incident Response Team (IRT) will be composed of the Information Security Manager and key 
members of the campus network administration and security staff.
 
D.
 
Information Security Officer (ISO)
 
It is the responsibilit
y of the head of each department, unit, and division of the University to appoint 
an Information Security Officer (ISO).  [Each ISO will have oversight responsibly in their respective 
area for insuring that information security practices are followed.  [Curr
ent personnel may be 
designated as an ISO, with the duties and responsibilities becoming an additional part of that 

 

The ISO must understand the importance of security, be capable of learning security basics, and 
most notably, have the authori
ty to carry out the responsibilities assigned.  [Additional 
responsibilities include:
 
1.  [Adherence to University policies and standards.
 
2.  [Ensuring that information security requirements are met for their organizational area 
including the performance of 
continuous risk analysis and business resumption planning in the 
event of technology failure.
 
3.  [Help to promote security awareness in their organizational area.
 
4.  [Advising administration of security shortfalls.
 
E.
  [
Information Security Administrator (I
SA)
 
Technical members of the local computer and network support personnel who also have security
-
related duties are designated Information Security Administrators (ISA).  [The ISO may also hold the 
designation of ISA.  [The ISAs are responsible for the estab
lishment and maintenance of security for 
computing systems and networks.  [The ISO should identify the local Information Security 
Administrators and coordinate their roles and responsibilities with respect to information security.  [
The Information Security 
Workgroup will provide assistance in educating the ISOs and ISAs with 
the standards and guidelines of the University.
 
In accordance with University 
Policy 0
-

1
 
(Using and Protecting Information Technology 
Resources) separate personnel may be responsible for the administration of systems.  [Under this 
policy those persons shall be designated as System Administrators.  [System Administrators will 
follow the Univers

the Information Security Administrators to insure compliance with security procedures.

3359-11-10  [  [ Access and acceptable use of university computer and 
informational resources
.  [(A) Authority.
 (1) 
The university of Akron is the legal owner or operator of all university "IT" 
systems, university "IT" resources and university information stored on those 
systems and resources.
 (B) Definitions and functions.
 (1) "IT". "IT" means information technology.
 (2) "Systems Authority." "Systems Authority" is the head of a specific 
subdivision, department, or office of the university who is responsible for 
oversight of particular "IT" systems, as delegated through the applicable 

organizational structure. This autho
rity may be delegated through the 
applicable organizational structure.
 (3) "Systems Administrator." "Systems Authorities" may designate another person 
or persons for purposes of system administration as "System Administrator" 
to manage the particular syste
m assigned to him or her. "Systems 

Administrators" oversee the day
-to-day operation of the system and are 
authorized to determine who is permitted access to particular IT resources.
 (4) "Certifying Authority." College deans, in the case of colleges, and th
e appropriate vice president, in the case of university administrative units, have 
"certifying authority" within their area of responsibility, and are thus 
responsible for certifying the appropriateness and accuracy of an official 

university document for e
lectronic publication in the course of university 
business.
 (5) "Information Owner." "Information Owners" are those individuals in a specific 
subdivision, department, or office of the university who have custody of the 

record information and who are accoun
table for its use and misuse. These 

individuals are often referred to as record custodians. "Information Owners" 

are authorized to determine who is permitted access to particular "IT" 
resources.
 (6) "IT" systems. "IT" systems are the electronic information
 processing, storage, 
and transmission systems, which include but are not limited to, the 
computers, terminals, printers, peripherals, PDAs and other portable devices, 

 3359-11-10  [  [  [  [  [2 networks, modem banks, online and offline storage media and related 
equipment, software,
 and data files that are owned, managed, or maintained 
by the university of Akron. "IT" systems also include, but are not limited to, 

institutional and departmental information systems, faculty research systems, 

desktop computers, the university's campus n
etwork, and university general 
access computer clusters.
 (7) "IT" resources. "IT" resources are the electronic facilities and electronic access 
codes and accounts made available to university faculty, staff, contract 
professionals, students and approved gu
ests, and include but are not limited 
to computers, networks, telephones, and information.
 (8) Specific authorization. Specific authorization is documented permission 
provided by the applicable "Systems Administrator," "Information Owner," 

or "Certifying A
uthority."
 (C) Scope. The access and acceptable use policies and related policies from this 
chapter apply to all "IT" users at the university of Akron and to all "IT" systems 

and "IT" resources at the university of Akron.
 (D) Privileges and responsibilitie
s. (1) The university of Akron provides "IT" resources and "IT" systems to the 
university community primarily to serve the interests of the University and 
its students in the course of normal operations. The provision of such 

services is in keeping with it
s academic, instructional, research, 

administrative and public purpose. Access and usage that do not support the 
university purpose are subject to restriction and regulation to avoid 

interference with university work and other applicable directives. All us
ers 
are obligated to abide by university directives, policies and regulations 
regarding usage.
 (2) Use of and access to "IT" systems and "IT" resources is a privilege, not a right. 
Except as indicated below, the university does not seek to monitor the 
comm
unications amongst its many and varied users. The university serves to 
transmit communications on its "IT" systems and "IT" resources from the 

senders to intended recipients. Users should not expect any right of privacy 

in the use of university "IT" system
s or "IT" resources since the university 
may be compelled under public records law, subpoena, investigation, or 

other law to release information transmitted through the university "IT" 

systems and "IT" resources. Additionally, the university reserves the r
ight to 
monitor, review, and release any such communications as necessary for 

purposes of security, public safety, or other situations such as suspected 

 3359-11-10  [  [  [  [  [3 disruption to "IT" systems or other shared resources or suspected violations 
of university rules or pro
cedures or local, state, or federal law. Accordingly, 
the university reserves the right to make rules and procedures that govern 
users' access and use.
 (3) The University is covered by several federal and state laws and regulations 
regarding information pr
ivacy and security and is committed to protecting 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all such sensitive and 
confidential information, including, but not limited to, protected health 

information and customer information. Therefore, effectiv
e "IT" security is 

the responsibility of every University "IT" user, and every "IT" user is 

responsible for knowing the rules related to access and acceptable use, 
privacy, and security.
 (E) Acceptable access and use standards.
 (1) Users are expected to us
e "IT" resources and "IT" systems in a responsible and 
efficient manner consistent with the instructional, research, and 
administrative goals of the university of Akron. The particular purposes of 

any "IT" system or "IT" resource, as well as the nature and
 scope of 
authorized, incidental personal use may vary according to the duties and 
responsibilities of the user.
 (2) Use of university "IT" resources and "IT" systems must comply with Ohio law 
and university policies and directives.
 (3) Users are entitled 
to access only those elements of "IT" systems that are 
consistent with their specific authorization. Consistent with the 
organizational structure, "System Authorities," "System Administrators," and 

"Information Owners" will authorize access to specific sys
tems based on the 
individual's need to know, the individual's unit, the type of data involved, 
and the intended use of the information.

To this end, intbrmation technology and university organizations shall:(1)Establish and protect the network perimeter(s) and facilitate the protection ofinternal netwoa'k zones housing and processing sensitive data in accordance withorganizational risk assessments as defined in The University of Toledo"Information Security Framework."(2) Provide secure remote access thi'ough the perimeter for authorized users. Remoteaccess users must be authenticated against the authorized access list in accordancewith the "Remote Access Security" policy.(3) Incorporate generally prescribed system hardening techniques. Organizationsshall determine which ports and services are required to suppoa't their businessprocesses and internal system interconnectivity, limit access to these access

Organizations shall coordinate with informationtechnology to identify the types of services and protocols permitted both withinthe network and that cross network boundaries. Some clear text services thatcross the network boundaries, such as file transfer protocol (FTP), provideconvenience to the user but carry significant risk to the network. Securitymeasures for services and protocols that cross network boundaries include, but arenot limited to:(a) Servers or firewalls configured specifically to protect againstvulnerabilities(b) Host-to-host management(c) Intemet protocol (IP) specification for source and destination(d) Strong authentication(e) Encryption(f) Packet filtering(g) Activity logging(h) Vii°real Private Network (VPN)(i) System and application software security fixes and patches(j) Using secured (encrypted) alternatives to clear text services andprotocols (example: the use of SSH instead oftelnet or the use of SFTPinstead of FTP.)(4) Authentication measures and procedures. Ensure that appropriate authenticationmeasures and procedures are in place for traffic that crosses universityboundaries. Authentication measures shall be consistent with the results of therisk assessment as defined in The University of Toledo "Information SecurityFramework."(a) Use protocols that do not transmit clear text, re-usable authenticationinformation across organizational boundaries.(b) Two-factor authentication may be implemented to limit access tosystems that contain data requiring more secure access or informationwhose disclosux'e would cause serious disruption or harm.(5) Control network traffic. At a minimum, the following functions shall beprovided:(a) Isolate and protect public and private World Wide Web (Web) servicesby installing in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).(b) Use DMZ security control for network traffic entering and leaving thenetwork and crossing security boundaries.(c) Establish and protect internal enclaves as required to protect sensitivedata by establishing internal security control points using technologiessuch as firewalls.

All repeated attempts from non-authorized entities to breach the boundary shall be monitored. Informationtechnology shall activate and review logs pursuant to the security audit loggingrequirements of university policy for "Security Incident Response" and report anyevidence of an attack or intrusion as specified by the organization's incidentreporting procedures.(7) Provide a common, standardized network time source. If systems do notaccommodate accepting external network times, upgrades to these systems shallbe able and configured to do so.In addition to serving as an important element in data accuracy, the timemechanisms of the various system components must be synchronized for securityreasons. Accurate, synchronized time logs are crucial for tracking a hacker'smovements through a system that the hacker has targeted.(E) Definitions(1) Access point. In this context, any point at which an entity outside the boundaryconnects to the network that contains secured assets.(2) Boundary. The perimeter where security controls are in effect to protect assets.(3) Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

The DMZ mediates communication betweenassets and creates a boundary security according to locally established securityand access control policies.(4)Encryption. The use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form inwhich there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of aconfidential process or key.(5)(7)(8)(6)File Transfer Protocol (FTP). An inherently unsecured (non-encrypted) servicethat allows computer-to-computer communication to exchange files directly,regardless of the platforms used. FTP can be accessed through either dial-upmodems or the Internet. Secured file transfer protocols such as SFTP or FTPSshould be used instead.Firewall. Either software or a combination of hardware and software, thatimplements security policy by governing traffic between two or more networks ornetwork segments. Firewalls are used to protect internal networks, servers andworkstations from unauthorized users or processes. Firewalls have variousconfigurations, from stand-alone servers to software on a notebook computer, andmust be configured properly to enable protection.Two-factor authentication. Authentication that incorporates two elements. Thereare three elements of authentication: "what you know" (for example, a passwordor PIN), "what you have" (for example, a digital certificate or a smart card), and"what you are" (for example, a biometric). Two-factor authentication iscommonly used for access to systems that contain data requiring secured access orinformation of which disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm. It is alsoknown as strong authentication, although strong authentication can have morethan two elements.Virtual Private Network (VPN). Uses a public telecommunication infrastructure,such as the Intemet, to provide remote offices or individual users with secureaccess to their organization's network.

fundamental importance of information resources and recognize his/her responsibility for the safekeepin
g 
of those resources. Users and system administrators must guard against abuses that disrupt or threaten 
the viability of all systems, including those connected to the MUS telecommunication network, the State 
telecommunication network, and other telecommun
ication networks to which MUS systems are 
connected.
 
 
 
Each user is responsible for having knowledge of MUS policies concerning security, privacy, and 
acceptable computing practices.
 
 
Each user of MUS computing and information resources must act 
responsibl
y. Each user is responsible for the integrity of these resources. Each user of MUS
-
owned or 
managed computing systems must be knowledgeable of and adhere to MUS policies, respect the rights 
of other users by minimizing unnecessary network traffic that migh
t interfere with the ability of others to 
make effective use of shared resources, respect the integrity of the physical facilities and controls, and 
obey all pertinent federal, state, county, and local laws and ordinances. Each user must abide by these 
pol
icies, laws, and contractual obligations, and adhere to appropriate ethical standards.
 
 

Students should never, without explicit permission, modify or ins
tall software on MUS computers; attach 
unauthorized hardware or otherwise modify the MUS network in any manner; modify, delete, or in any 

prohibited by loc
al campus policies.
 
 
In that regard, each campus must clearly identify what MUS information technology resources are 
available for use by its students, and clearly identify those activities that are and are not appropriate for 
each resource. This includes 
but is not limited to use of resources such as e
-
mail systems, internal and 
external network facilities, student
-
accessible computer labs, and accounts on MUS
-
owned or operated 
computer systems.  [If a campus provides special services to residents of its un
iversity
-
provided housing, 
it must clearly identify what special services are provided and what activities are and are not appropriate 
in the use of those services by residents.
 
 
B.  [
ENSURING COMPLIANCE
 
 
It is the responsibility of the Student Affairs Offic
e on each campus to ensure that all students are aware 
of MUS policies and procedures concerning the use of MUS computing and information technology 
resources, understand them, and comply with them. In the case of special services provided to residents 
of 
university
-
provided housing, it is the responsibility of the campus housing operation unit to ensure that 
residents are aware of and comply with separate policies that govern the use of special services available 
only to housing residents.

Information Technology
WMU Telephone Instrument
Relocation Requirements
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
These requirements involve the relocation* of University-installed Voice over
IP telephone instruments.
University-supplied telephone instruments and network ports are provided
by the Office of Information Technology for University business
communications and to serve the resident students on campus. In addition,
they are an integral component of the campus emergency response system by
providing 9-1-1 direct dial to the WMU Public Safety dispatch center.
WMU Public Safety is provided with the installation locations of each
telephone instrument, whether a traditional PBX telephone or a VoIP
instrument. While it is technically possible to relocate* a VoIP telephone from
one active jack to another, doing so will result in Public Safety having
erroneous location data for the telephone, with the possible consequence of
not being able to locate a caller in the case of an emergency.
REQUIREMENTS
WMU telephone users are not permitted to move a VoIP telephone
instrument from the jack where it was originally installed without first
contacting the OIT telecommunications office. If it is determined that a spare,
active, compatible network jack is available and can be identified, OIT can
arrange for a customer-initiated move without charge. If relocation* requires
a customer visit by a technician, prevailing service rates will be charged.
If telephone users do not know if the telephone is a VoIP phone, they need to
contact OIT 
before 
relocating a phone.
JUSTIFICATION
O!ice of Information Technology
Western Michigan University
Kalamazoo MI 49008-5206 USA
(269) 387-5430
It is essential that WMU Public Safety be able to locate any 9-1-1 caller
quickly and accurately. WMU does not currently possess the technology to
either prevent or track the unauthorized relocation* of VoIP telephones,
except through periodic audits, or reports by WMU Public Safety.
If a telephone instrument is relocated* without updating its location in the
telecommunications management system, WMU Public Safety will be unable
to locate that caller in case of an emergency.
ENFORCEMENT
Any person found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to
appropriate consequences, including but not limited to disciplinary action as
described by current University requirements and/or applicable collective
bargaining agreement.
If a customer telephone is discovered to have been relocated* without the
knowledge and consent of OIT telecommunication, OIT will not be
responsible for, nor will OIT cover, any costs associated with the
unauthorized relocation*, including applicable service charges. An individual
who relocates* a VoIP telephone without the knowledge and consent of OIT
telecommunications may be personally liable for any claims arising out of the
unauthorized relocation*.
*Relocate -- For the purpose of this document relocation/relocate/relocated
refers to the movement of a VoIP instrument from one network port/data
jack to another network port/data jack.

limited
 to the
 following:
  [a. To 
protect
 the 
integrity,
 security,
 or functionality
 of University
 or 
other
 information
 technology
 resources,
 or to 
protect
 the
 University
 from
 harm;
 b. There

 or is 
violating,
 any
 Notre

 policy
 or applicable 
civil
 or 
criminal
 law;
 or c. An information
 technology
 resource
 appears

  [2.8 Appropriate use of
 Electronically Stored Information
. The University 
recognizes that there is a risk of abuse and misappropriation connected to the access to 
electronically stored information (ﬁESIﬂ), especially when the access is by someone other 

than the regular steward or user of the ESI.  [To help guard ag
ainst potential abuse or 
misappropriation, individuals with access to 
ESI 
must:  [
  [2.8.1. Comply with all 
applicable laws, all applicable University rules and 
policies, and all contracts and licenses.  [
Access to ESI 
by those other than the normal 
users or 
stewards must be
 only for lawful purposes, and not for any purpose that is 
illegal, immoral, unethical, dishonest, damaging to the reputation of the University, 

inconsistent with the mission and values of the University, or likely to subject the 

University
 to harm.  [
  [
2.8.2. Inform and seek collaboration with the appropriate Data Steward when 
accessing and using information stewarded outside of the individual™s own area of 

responsibility.  [Stewards have the duty to assure data is being sought for legitimate
 purposes and should assist accordingly.  [
See Appendix A for assistance identifying 

University Data Stewards.
  [2.8.3.  [Obtain
 approval of the appropriate data steward(s) before releasing 
University information or analysis based on University information to
 parties outside 
of the University.  [If unsure who the appropriate data steward is, an individual should 

contact 
the Campus Data Steward
 for guidance.  [This policy does not interfere with an 
employee™s ability to communicate with government officials and a
gencies in their 
individual capacity or with an individual™s capacity to cooperate in a government 

investigation.  [
  [
2.8.4. When using samples sizes of three or less, take care not to share information 
and take all necessary precautions to protect confiden
tiality.
  [  [Page
 3  [ 
2.8.5. If information, data, or reports are provided for a specific purpose, that 
information, data, or report should be used for those purposes only.  [
  [2.8.6. Complete and periodically renew any certification or mandatory training 
courses requ
ired by 
the appropriate Data Steward, with oversight of the Information 
Governance Committee if necessary.  [Data Stewards are responsible for deciding, 

maintaining, and monitoring what certifications and training courses, if any, are 

required for access to
 and use of the data they steward.
  [All users 
must certify that 
they have reviewed and understand th
is Responsible Use of Data and Information 
Technology Resources
 Policy
 when they are assigned a Notre Dame NetID and 
periodically as follows:
  [a) When granted access to resources designated by the Information 

Governance Committee as requiring acknowledgement of this policy; or 
  [b) Every five (5) years while having access to any resources designated by the 

Information Governance Committee as requiri

 information technology
 resources,
 whether
 affiliated
 with the
 University
 or not, 
and
 to all uses 
of those 
resources,
 whether

 or operated
 by specific 
units
 of the
 University,
 or to uses within 
specific
 units.
 Members
 of the University
 community

Introduction 
 
 
 
New 
Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
was founded in 1888 as Las Cruces College
. 
The Territorial Legislature of 1889 
established the land
-
grant Agricultural College and Experiment Station, which officially opened on January 21, 
1890
. 
During its first full academic year,
 
the college became known as the New Mexico College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts, the first degree granting institution in the Territory
. 
Under the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862 
and subsequent federal legislation, the special mission of land
-
gr
ant institutions has been to provide a liberal and 
practical education for students and to sustain programs of research, extension education, and public ser
vice
.
 
 
In 1960, New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts became New Mexico State 
U
niversi
ty
. 
Since that 
time, while sustaining excellence in those programs traditionally associated with land
-
grant institutions, New 
Mexico State has become a comprehensive doctoral level 
university
 
offering a wide variety of programs through the 
Graduate School 
and the colleges:  [Agriculture and Home Economics, Arts and Sciences, Business Administration 
and Economics, Education, Engineering, and Health and Social Ser
vice
s.
 
 
New Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
is the state

s land
-
grant 
university
, serving the educational 
needs of New Mexico

s 
diverse population through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, and public ser
vice
.
 
 
The New Mexico Constitution 
establishes New Mexico State University as 

educational
 
i
nstitution
s
, and 
requires the legislature to provide for the control and management of the institution 
through a five member 
Board of Regents
, which serves as the 
g
overning 
b
ody 
for both 
New Mexico State University 
as well as for th
e 
N
ew Mexico Department 
of Agriculture.

Statement of Policy:
 
This policy will apply to all cash balances of the 
university
, with the sole 
exception of those cash balances associated with the 
university

s Endowment Funds, which are 
invested under a revocable
 
trust agreement by the NMSU 
F
oundation, Inc.
 
 
The policy is designed to govern all investment transactions for the prudent investment of cash 
balances, and to maximize the efficiency of the 
university

s cash management system. The goal of 
the policy is to
 
protect funds by investing such funds in a manner, which provides for the safety of 
principal and adequate liquidity, while maximizing investment income.
 
 
Cash balances of the 
university
 
may be held in interest and non
-
interest bearing demand and 
interest
-
bearing time deposits of financial institutions, or invested in securities and/or other 
financial instruments which, under the direction of the 
Board of Regents
, are considered to be 
relatively safe. The 
Board of Regents
 
has the authority to make investme
nt decisions in the best 
interests of the 
university
. 
 
As such, investment decisions will be made with due care and 
judgment, taking into consideration principal preservation in addition to income maximization, 
and not for speculative purposes.
 
 
B.
 
Return

period, or other 
appropriate performance measures as determined by the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
finance and 
administration

2.
 
Mark
etability: analysis of relative marketability of alternate investments in case of forced sale 
and/or possibility of future trade.
 
 
3.
 
Intermarket Yield Analysis: analyze the spread relationship between sectors of the market, 
i.e., Treasury Bill vs. Discount N
otes, to take advantage of aberration in yield differentials.
 
 
4.
 
Yield Curve Analysis: analyze the slope of the yield curve to determine most attractive 
maturities for earning maximum return with minimum risk.
 
 
5.
 
General Economic and Interest Rate Outlook: rev
iew and analyze current literature on interest

I.
 
Maturity Restrictions:
 
Investment maturities for cash balances will be scheduled to coincide with 
projected cash flow
. The 
university
 
will not commit any discretionary funds to maturities longer 
than 
ten
 
years from the date of purchase. 
Funds will only be committed to maturities longer than 
five years from the date of purchase if directly related to a specific capital or
 
other long
-
term 
project.  [
Investment of non
-
discretionary funds will reflect maturity dates not to exceed the final 
maturity dates established within the funds

 
restrictive purposes. At least 50% of all cash balances 
will be invested in maturities 
less th
an
 
two years.
 
 
J.
 
Diversification:
 
The 
university
 
will diversify its use of investment instruments to avoid incurring 
unreasonable risks inherent in over
-
investing in specific instruments, individual financial 
institutions or maturities. With the exception
 
of U.S. Treasury securities and authorized pools, no 
more than 50% of the total investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type or with a 
single financial institution or at a single maturity.
 
 
K.
 
Trading Securities (Swaps):
 
The 
university
 
will attempt to take advantage of temporary 
aberrations in the market by trading securities of comparable quality to further improve the overall 
rate of return on the portfolio. It is the policy to trade only if both an improvement in yield (pick
-
up in bas
is points) and an increase in net monetary return will be realized by the 
university
 
over 
the life of the 
original investment
. Three basic trading techniques are used to accomplish this goal:
 
 
1.
 
The Substitution Swap: this technique involves trading in owned
 
security of a certain class 
i.e
., U.S. Treasury Notes, for a comparable security of equal quality, i.e., U.S. Treasury Bills 
(or other Notes), for a net pick
-
up yield. The new security is a perfect 
substitute
 
for the old 
security in terms of quality, matu
rity, and marketability.
 
 
2.
 
The Intermarket Spread Swap: this technique takes advantage of the spreads in yield, which 
exist from, time
-
to
-
time between different sectors of the market, i.e., Treasuries vs. Agencies. 
(An example would be to sell Treasury Bill
s or Notes and purchase FHLB Discount Notes or 
debentures of comparable maturity when the spread becomes wider than is considered normal 
under prevailing market conditions.)
 
 
3.
 
The Maturity Extension Swap: this technique involves lengthening the maturity of 
owned 
securities when a normal 
up sloping
 
yield curve exists to take advantage of higher returns at 
longer maturities. (In the case of an extreme inverted yield curve, maturities can sometimes be 
shortened to achieve a net gain.) A yield pickup may be achi
eved by rolling out the curve 
within the same class of securities or by intermarket extensions which must be evaluated not 
only on the relative maturity extension, but also on the relative intermarket spread. Maturity 
extension swaps are subject to restric
tions imposed by cash disbursement requirements.
 
 
The investment manager will 
not
 
engage in any other Trading Techniques unless prior written 
approval is obtained from the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
administration and finance
.
 
 
The following criteria are es
tablished for evaluating a swap in the 

 
marketable 
securities portfolio:
 
 
1. 
 
On maturities of one year or more, the gain per transaction must be at least $1,000.00 per 

NMSU Policy Manual 
  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [

million dollars (GPM) invested.
 
 
2.
 
On maturities of 90 days to one year, the 
gain per transaction must be at least $500.00 per 
million dollars invested.
 
 
3.
 
On maturities of less than 90 days, trade will be made at the discretion of the 

 
investment manager.
 
 
In many yield pickup transactions (particularly when interest rat
es are rising), a book loss must be 
recorded at the time of the sale of the owned investment. It is the policy of the 
university
 
to charge 
the loss against the interest income account, recognizing that this loss will be fully recovered, and 
an incremental 
gain will be earned, over the life of the original investment.
 
 
L.
 
Safekeeping and Collateralization:
 
All investment securities other than local financial institution 
Certificates of Deposit purchased by the 
university
 
will be held in the 

 
name
 
by a 
third
-
party custodian approved by 
university
 
administration. All transactions will be evidenced by 
safekeeping receipts.
 
 
Deposit
-
type securities will be collateralized in accordance with the State 
board
 
of Finance 
collateral policy.
 
 
M.
 
Authorized F
inancial Dealers and Institutions:
 
 
The 
d
irector
 
of 
t
reasury 
s
er
vice
s will maintain a 
list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment ser
vice
s. No deposit shall be made 
except in a qualified depository as established by the 
Board of Regents
. In addition, a list will be 
maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by credit
-
worthiness. These may include 
primary dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities & Exchange Commission Rule 
15C3
-
1 (uniform, net capital rule).
 
 
An annual review of the financial condition and registrations of qualified dealers and institutions 
will be conducted by the 
d
irector
 
of 
t
reasury 
s
er
vice
s. A current audited financial statement is 
required to be on file for each financial institution and b
roker/dealer with which the 
university
 
deposits and invests monies.
 
 
The 
university
 
will give first preference
 
to investment with local dealers and institutions within the 
guidelines of this policy. Investment with out
-
of
-
state dealers and institutions wil
l require prior 
approval of the

bearing demand and t
ime deposits) are pooled in order to 
determine a weighted average monthly interest earnings rate. In order to compute this rate, all such 
investment earnings are accrued monthly, including amortizing premiums and crediting discounts 
on short and long
-
term 
investments.
 
 
The monthly earning on these pooled invest
ments are allocated to various 
university
 
accounts in 
accordance with externally mandated requirements (
i.e
.
,
 
bond resolutions) and other internal 
designations. Nothing herein shall prohibit separatio
n of bond proceeds, reserve funds, or other 
non
-
discretionary funds from the pooled investment fund. The 
s
enior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
a
dministration and 
f
inance
 
approves all such internal designations. The allocation is based upon 
the average monthly cash bal
ance in each of these 
university
 
accounts, with the remaining balance 
of the pooled earnings being allocated to unrestricted current funds.
 
 
Under this m
ethod, all of these designated 
university
 
accounts (other than current unrestricted 
funds) will be pres
umed to have 100% of their cash balances invested in the pooled investment 
account, unless the 
senior 
vice
 
president
 
for 
administration and
 
finance 
determines that lesser 
percentage is to be utilized for a given account(s).
 
 
At the discretion of the 
s
enior
 
vice
 
president
 
for 
a
dministration and 
f
inance
 
separate investment 
accounts may be set up at external institutions and utilized to adequately monitor the earning of 
certain 
university
 
accounts. These separate accounts are also restricted to investments tha
t are 
considered relatively safe, as determined by the 
Board of Regents
.

2.
 
Normall
y the donor will have a maximum of five (5) years to meet the minimum funding 
level requirement, absent rare special circumstance
s. 
 
 
3.
 
In the case of deferred gifts, the gift must normally be irrevocable in nature before being 
eligible for naming.
 
 
4.
 
Academic and Major University Units.  [The funding required for naming academic or other 
major university units should be of a level that 
will transform the very nature of the unit 
involved, enabling that unit to reach a level of excellence that would have been impossible 
using university funds alone.
 
 
a.
 
The gift should be in the form of an endowment, with income from the endowment used 
to pro
vide a margin of excellence for the unit involved.  [
 
b.
 
The gift income derived from endowment earnings should not replace university funds 
previously made available to that unit. 
 
c.
 
Endowment levels will vary by school based upon its specific mission and scope
 
that 
determines needs and programs.  [Certain units may require a higher minimum than those 
suggested. 
 
 
5.
 
Faculty Positions.  [Naming opportunities for endowed faculty positions are available 
throughout the university.  [Naming will be independent of all appo
intment and curriculum 
decisions which the university will continue to make in keeping with its policies, established 
practices and academic mission.  [Distributed earnings may be used to provide partial salary 

 
specific teaching and research requirements, 
including laboratory equipment, support staff, graduate assistants, research materials and 
technology. 
 
 
6.
 
Chair.  [An endowed
 
chair is a select faculty position filled by an outstanding scholar and 
teacher, as ju
dged by rigorous nationally accepted standards.  [Some colleges, schools or 
departments may require a higher amount of funding, which is often market driven.
 
 
7.
 
Professorship.  [An endowed professorship is typically held by a faculty member whose 
accomplishmen
ts indicate potential for national and international leadership and distinction in 
their field, and whose current efforts are focused on honing teaching skills and/or establishing 
a superior record of research or other scholarly activity. Distributed earni
ngs may be used to 

research needs.
 
 
8.
 
Lecture Series.  [An endowed lecture series play an important role in the academic life of the 
campus.  [They allow faculty, sta
ff, students, and the larger NMSU community to interact with 
distinguished leaders who influence disciplines, society, the nation or the world.  [Because of 
the intensive planning and implementation required for lecture series, these should be 
determined in
 
consultation between the Office of University Advancement, departmental 
administration and the donor.  [In some instances, it is beneficial to structure biennial lectures 
and/or link a gift to an existing lecture series.  [The endowment provides the resourc
es to cover 
the expenses of bringing renowned speakers to the campus, such as honoraria, publicity, and 
the expenses of the host faculty members. A named lecture series may be established within a 
unit or may be campus
-
wide in nature.
 
 
9.
 
Fellowships and Assi
stantships.  [Fellowship awards may include a research or teaching 
assignment if deemed appropriate.  [Assistantships require students to work in exchange for 
this support. 
 
 
a.
 
Graduate Fellowships and Assistantships.  [Graduate Fellowships and Assistantships 
p
rovide a vital means of bringing the best and brightest graduate students to New Mexico 
State. Students are working toward an advanced degree in any graduate program.  [

Postdoctoral Fellowships.  [Recent Ph.D. graduates continue their research agenda for a 
one to two
-
year period in a focused environment bringing innovative research to the 
campus.

facility, including but 
not limited to facilities signage, directional signage, publications, 
internal and external communications, to reflect the recognition name.
 
 
2.
 
Because of the relative permanence of decisions to name buildings, areas, or spaces, it is 
prudent to allow reason
able time for consideration at each stage of the process.
 
 
3.
 
New Facilities.  [Naming opportunities involving new facilities must be approved by the 
NMSU President and the Board of Regents, after consideration of the recommendation from

c.
 
Endowment raised will be distributed proportionately among donors of the various 
naming opportunities.
 
d.
 
Naming opportunities for facilities must be defined and approved prior to the launch of 
the fundraising eff
ort.  [The most significant gifts will normally be solicited at the outset 
of the fundraising campaign, and clarity and consistency with lead donors on the 
opportunities and policies is essential.  [
 
e.
 
An initial list of the proposed naming opportunities for a
ny new facility project is to be 
coordinated through the Office of University Advancement.  [This list may be revised as 
planning proceeds and the fundraising plan is developed.  [
 
f.
 
This initial list of proposed naming opportunities is to include a descriptio
n of the size 
and function of all spaces proposed for naming as well as a plan for the display or 
physical presentation of the names.
 
g.
 
For gifts involving the naming of benches, fountains, display space, or other outdoor 
structures or areas, the gift must c
over the entire cost of the structure or installation and if 
ongoing operations and maintenance cost will be incurred, an endowment sufficient to 
cover these costs may also be required.  [
 
 
4.
 
Existing Facilities: Existing facilities as yet unnamed are availab
le to be named for a donor 
under each of the following situations:
 
 
a.
 
In cases of major renovations which extend throughout an existing building:

the minimum 
specified level of gifts including endowment as determined by the Office of University 
Advancement in collaboration with the appropriate college/department administrator.  [
 
b.
 
The naming opportunities and levels would be based upon the size, use,
 
and priority of 
the space.  [
 
c.
 
Private fundraising goals will be determined by construction costs, and may include an 
endowment for maintenance of the facility.  [Endowment will be distributed 
proportionately among donors of the various naming opportunities.
 
6.
 
Donor Initiated Projects:  [From time to time, a prospective donor will propose a gift to fund a 
project or activity no specifically addressed in this policy, in which case, the following will 
apply: 
 
 
 
a.
 
If ongoing operations and maintenance costs will be i
ncurred, an endowment sufficient to 
cover these costs may also be required.
 
b.
 
Such donor initiated gifts are subject to the approval from the NMSU President and 
the 
Board of Regents, after consideration of the recommendation from the Naming 
Committee.
 
 
G.
 
Durat
ion of Naming
:  [As the university grows, so do the space and academic needs of the campus.  [
In order to successfully meet these changing needs, it may become necessary from time to time to 
relocate, remove or eliminate named facilities or academic units.  [
Should a named property be 
affected by such changes, the Naming Committee will be convened to discuss and review each 
issue on a case by case basis.  [  [
 
 
1.
 
Structure Removal or Modification:  [The university 
shall
 
honor a naming for the life of the 
property, 
unless otherwise noted in the agreement.  [In the event a named property or academic 

authorized representative to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution that preserves the
 
history 
of the gift.  [Solutions may include (1) the placement of a plaque adjacent to the former site of 
the facility that memorializes the gift and the facility that used to stand there or, if applicable; 
(2) the naming of a space in any new structure er
ected on the site.  [The university reserves the 
right to not retain any names assigned to internal portions of a property that is 
razed
.  [
 
 
2.
 
Name Removal:  [The university reserves the right to remove a name from any and all naming 
opportunities covered by t
his policy.  [The Naming Committee will review any change in 
circumstances brought to its attention and make a recommendation
, through the University 
Administrative Council,
 
to the NMSU president and Board of Regents as to whether the name 
should be retaine
d or removed.  [Circumstances that may lead to the removal of a name 
include the perpetration of a heinous crime by an individual whose name appears on a naming 
opportunity, and/or donor failure to fulfill gift commitments as specified in the agreement 
(
e.g
.,
 
estate gifts, where the donor was to name the university as a beneficiary; failure to 
complete a multi
-
year pledge, etc.).

Advancement will be responsible for providing an official receipt to the donor, for appropriate 
acknowledgment, and for 
informing the appropriate campus personnel. However, departments 
awarding restricted gifts for student aid are entirely responsible for ensuring that all donor criteria, 
financial and otherwise, have been met.  [The 
board
 
prefers that real estate and gifts
-
in
-
kind be given 
free of restrictions which would reduce the full range of educational benefits which could be realized 
from the gift.  [If restrictions are imposed upon the gift
,
 
or if the gift is such as to require costs of care, 
maintenance or upkeep, su
ch gift must be first approved by the 
board
 
or 
its
 
designees before 
acceptance by the 
board
.  [Gifts of real estate may be given through the
 
NMSU

A.
 
Gift Income Spending Po
licy
: The 
university
 
recognizes the importance of private gift income in 
providing its colleges and departments the flexibility needed to achieve 
its
 
goals and objectives.  [
The 
university
 
also recognizes that different colleges and departments will have va
rying needs and 
priorities for the use of the private gift income as they continue to develop and maintain quality 
programs.  [This policy is designed to provide those areas receiving private gifts the maximum 
amount of latitude to address these differing g
oals and objectives while at the same time 
maintaining the fiduciary responsibility inherent in the acceptance of these funds.  [Gift income 
received by the 
university
 
from any external source, including the 
NMSU 
Foundation, will be 
expended in compliance w
ith this policy.  [In all cases, exceptions may be made if these types of 
expenditures are sanctioned by 
the Offices of the 
P
resident
 
or 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
and 
P
r
ovost
 
for college or 
university
-
wide functions.  [All expenditures must be for the enhance
ment or 
benefit of the 
university,
 
in recognition of the 

 
official mission statement.  [In general, 
gift funds will be recorded in the current restricted fund, as they are externally restricted to 
purpose, even if internally unrestricted as to n
ature of expenditure.  [Only those gift funds which 
are received by the 
university
 
for any related 
university
 
purpose, without restriction of any type, 
are to be recorded in the current unrestricted fund.  [Within this policy, restricted fund income will 
be 
subdivided into restricted and unrestricted gifts based only on the level of donor specification 
attached to the gift, as explained below.
 
 
B.
 
Restricted Gift Income
:  [For the purpose of this policy, restricted gift income is defined as all gift 
income on whi
ch the donor has placed specific restrictions beyond the general purpose for which 
the income is to be used.  [Thus, income designated for a specific college or department's general 
use will be classified as unrestricted gift income, as long as that college
 
or department is given full 
authority to decide how the funds are to be best spent in compliance with the general guidelines 
detailed above.  [Any gift income which must be spent for a specific purpose, such as scholarships 
or travel reimbursement, or unde
r any specific conditions, such as following a certain event or 
date, will be classified as restricted.  [All restricted gift income, if accepted and expended, will be 
expended according to the written restrictions of the donor, without exception.  [The Offi
ce of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
niversity
 
Advancement will be responsible for accepting these restrictions 
before the gift is accepted on behalf of the 
university.
  [
Following this approval, the documented 
restrictions will take precedence over the guidelines
 
for disbursement of funds outlined below.
 
 
C.
 
Unrestricted Gift Income
:  [For the purpose of this policy, unrestricted gift income is defined as all 
gift income received by the 
university
 
and not classified as restricted gift income.  [Expenditures 
allowable f
rom this category of gift income will be limited by applicable laws, statutes, and 
regulations, and by this policy.  [It will be the responsibility of the Business Office to identify gifts 
as unrestricted, and to verify that donor's intent related to the de
partment within the 
university
 
in 
which the funds are to be spent is honored.
 
 
D.
 
Authorization Structure
:  [The standard approval structure in place for expenditure of non
-
gift 
funds will be followed for gift funds.  [All non
-
payroll expenditures are to be app

Cash 
Disbursement Controls
:  [All existing 
university
 
internal controls will apply to disbursements 
made from gift funds.  [All requests for expenditure will be submitted on the appropriate form; 
separate vouchers exist for requesting disbursements directly from 
the 
university
 
and the 
NMSU 
Foundation.  [All vouchers will be accompanied by invoice or receipt support, or the attestation of 
the individual claiming reimbursement if other documentation is not applicable.

Guidelines for Disbursements of Funds
:  [All gift
 
income funds will be used by or for the benefit of 
the 
university
 
in fulfilling its mission of teaching, research, and public ser
vice
, including expenses 
sanctioned for the improvement of employee morale.  [All types of expenditures falling under these 
gui
delines will be allowable, with the following exceptions:
 
 
1.
 
Any payment in conflict with existing law, statute, or regulation applicable to private gift 
funds.
 
 
2.
 
Charitable contributions made to entities or individuals external to the 
university.
  [
Where 
appr
opriate, expenses incurred by separate nonprofit organizations which could have 
legitimately been considered

he approval of 
the Office of

P
resident
 
for 
Administration
 
and Finance 
to the 
university.
 
 
3.
 
Any duplicate payment for goods and ser
vice
s, or reimbursement of employee expense.  [
Duplicate payments include the reimbursement of actual travel expense
 
to employees who 
have already received per diem payment through other sources.
 
 
4.
 
Payment for 
university
 
employee ser
vice
s outside the payroll system.
 
 
5.
 
Gifts made to 
university
 
personnel except as recognition of ser
vice
 
to the 
university.
 
 
6.
 
Loans to any indi
vidual, unless the gift was made for the specific purpose of establishing a 
loan fund.
 
 
7.
 
Payment of fines imposed for violations of local, state, or federal law, unless resulting from 
university
 
negligence.
 
 
8.
 
Memberships in organizations, country clubs, or o
ther expenditures for any individual, where 
it cannot be demonstrated that the expenditure is for the enhancement or benefit of the 
university.
 
 
G.
 
Endowment Trust
:  [The 
Board of Regents
 
approved the revocable Endowment Trust Agreement to 
cover the establi
shment of endowments, making it possible to take money that has been privately 
contributed to the 
NMSU 
Foundation for endowed chairs, professorships, or lectureships and 
match it with monies from the State of New Mexico.  [The monies may be placed together 
into a 
trust, managed by the 
NMSU 
Foundation in such a way that the 
NMSU 
Foundation retains title to 
the private money and the 
board
 
retains title to the state money in a revocable trust.  [The 
board
 
may designate a change in trustee at 
its
 
discretion at an
y time or may dissolve the agreement if 
it
 
desire
s
.  [The assignment may allow the 
NMSU 
Foundation its usual management fee as trustee. It 
must, however, contain provisions (1) for termination of the placement of all or part of these 
endowments in the trust
 
at any time at the 
board

s sole discretion; (2) for annual accountings; and 
(3) for absolute authority on the part of the 
board
 
for the disposition of each of the endowments 
(consistent with the terms of each particular endowment).

contributions are received as memorials from those who wish to convey their s
ympathy upon the 
death of a relative, friend, or colleague.  [The 
university
 
provides an official receipt for all gifts, 
and, when contributions are made in memoriam, informs the family that a memorial gift has been 
made. Amounts of the contributions are no
t disclosed.  [
Faculty and staff may contribute through 
the Foundation via payroll deduction arranged through the

I.
 
NMSU Foundation, Inc.
:  [The NMS
U
 
Foundation, Incorporated, is a private, nonprofit corporation 
whose o
nly purpose is to accept and administer gifts in support of the 
university.
  [
The 
NMSU 
Foundation is a tax
-
exempt corporation, registered with the appropriate state and federal agencies.  [
Contributions to the Foundation are exempt for federal income tax pur
poses.  [The 
NMSU 
Foundation works closely with the 
university.
  [
Its directors, who are committed to attracting 
private resources for the benefit of the 
university,
 
serve without compensation. Contributions may 
be made for annual operating expenses or for t

Affiliated Organizations
:  [Numerous organizations have been established to support 
the 
Board of Regents
 
in a variety of ways and are separate, not
-
for
-
profit entities.  [The focus of the 
following policy statement is on those or
ganizations whose primary functions are to solicit, 
manage, and distribute funds and other assets that are given to these organizations for the support 
of the 
university
 
in general or specific colleges or other program areas of the 
university.
  [
The 
univers
ity
 
recognizes advantages of these organizations, such as:
 
 
1.
 
Creating an opportunity for private individuals and organizations to invest in the enrichment 
of the programs with greater assurance that the benefits of their gifts supplement, not 
supplant, stat
e appropriations to the institution.
 
 
2.
 
Providing a corporate structure for managing private gifts, including endowments and 
income
-
producing real property, that do
es
 
not jeopardize the 

 
tax
-
exempt status, 
create unnecessary unrelated business ta
x obligations, or create additional liabilities for the 
university.
 
 
3.
 
Creating an effective forum for alumni and community leaders to participate in and contribute 
to strengthening the 
university
 
through their participation in the solicitation, management, 
and 
distribution of private gifts and donations to the 
university.
 
 
(Other separate entities have been established for purposes unrelated to soliciting or managing 
gifts and donations on behalf of the 
university
; i.e., the NMSU Research Park Corporation an
d 
Arrowhead Center, Inc.,
 
which engage in the commercialization of research productivity.  [
However, this policy focuses on those organizations created to actively engage in raising 
funds for the 
university.

K.
 
R
ecognition
:  [Any organization formed to rep
resent the 
university
 
or any college, department, or 
program area of the institution will receive approval by the 
university
 
to represent it to prospective 
donors.  [A condition of any recognition of an organization will be that the organization agrees to 
c
onduct its business in concert with 
university
 
policy for such organizations.  [A written agreement 
will be executed between the 
university
 
and each organization, consistent with these policies but 
recognizing the specific significantly performing fund

such organization will use funds received by the organization for the ben
efit of the 
university
 
to employ staff independently of the 
university.
  [
The 
university
 
and the organization may 
agree to allocate some of the income the organization earns to the 
university
 
for the specific 
purpose of supplementing institutional staff sup
port.  [This provision does not preclude the 
affiliated organization from directly retaining professional ser
vice
s as is deemed necessary for 
the organization to fulfill its responsibilities to the donors and to the 
university,
 
with the 
understanding that t
he retention of fund
-
raising and/or public relations consultants must be

the coordination 
of solicitations and prospect contacts.  [The acceptance of any gift or donation that 
contains restrictions as to its use requires a matching fiscal obligation of the 
university,
 
creates a 
future obligation of the 
university,
 
or involves real property must 
be approved by the 
president
 
(or 
designee).
  [
Although each organization would be expected to maintain records of gifts and 
donations received and to properly acknowledge such gifts, the 
university
 
has designated the 
Office of the 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U
nivers

-
keeping agency for 
all gifts and donations received on behalf of the 
university.

t
he 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
for 
U

Advancement is available to advise and/or assist any affiliated 
organization in designing and conducting fund
-
raising campaigns. No affiliated organizations will 
accept any funds intended for a 
university
 
organizational uni
t which requires performance or 
ser
vice
 
by the 
university.
  [
Income generated by a 
university
 
program or ser
vice
 
is revenue of the 
university
 
and must be directly deposited into a 
university
 
account.
 
 
O.
 
Management of Gifts and Donations
:  [All gift monies, 
whether received directly by the 
university
 
or indirectly through a 
university
-
affiliated organization, will be managed in accordance with 
investment policies approved by the 
Board of Regents
.  [Affiliated organizations are encouraged to 
deposit their gift 
receipts with the 
university
 
for the specific organization. Oversight of the funds 
deposited in these agency accounts is the responsibility of the organization. The 
university
 
will 
provide all accounting ser
vice
s related to the funds for the organization. 
 
Short

term investment 
income earned by the 
university
 
on funds in these accounts will be allocated to the accounts.  [Gifts 
received in the form of endowments by any recognized affiliated organization should be assigned 
to the 
NMSU 
Foundation, for investme
nt management purposes.  [All endowments must be 
managed in accordance with investment policies approved by the 
board
.  [The identity of 
individual endowments will be maintained by the 
NMSU 
Foundation; however, endowment funds 
may be co
-
invested in a pooled 
funds approach.  [Consolidation of the endowment investment 
management program provides the opportunity for cost
-
effective management of the endowments.  [

Endowments retained by the organizations or transferred to the 
NMSU 
Foundation through 
revocable trust 
agreements will be maintained on the organization

s books.  [Gifts received in the 
form of real property will be managed in accordance with the donor

s request.  [If the donor 
specifies that the property be used by the 
university
 
in its gift form, such as ar
t work, library 
books, real estate, etc., the property will be transferred to the 
university.
  [
If the donor desires that 
the property be used to establish an endowment, or if the gift is real property or property interest, 
the gift will be assigned to the 
NMSU 
Foundation, for management purposes.  [The 
NMSU 
Foundation may retain the real property and use the income earned to accomplish the donor

s gift 
objectives.  [If the donor permits, and it is a better investment management decision to dispose of 
the real
 
property, the 
NMSU 
Foundation will use the proceeds from these sales to establish the 
endowment.  [The 
NMSU 
Foundation will obtain 
university
 
approval before disposing of any real 
property.  [No individual member, director, or officer of an affiliated organ
ization should accept 
any gift or gratuity that is offered because of the individual

s position held with the organization

.  [Exceptions may be made for awards, recognition, etc.  [Any 
funds intended for employee compensation will be transferred to a 
university
 
account and 
s
ubsequently disbursed in accordance with 
university
 
policies and procedures. The affiliated 
organizations will receive interest income earned on funds in agency bank accounts held by the 
university
 
in the name of the organizations, and may use such income 
to cover operating expenses 
directly incurred by the organizations. Organizations should establish policies for the review of 
any business transactions involving its members and the organization.  [Members, directors, and 
officers of the organization should
 
disqualify themselves from making, participating in, or in any 
way attempting to use their position to influence decisions in which they have or would have a 
financial interest.  [Organizations will establish policies which preclude the use of any funds 
re
ceived or earned by the organization to support any political candidate.  [Organization funds will

ssets, liabilities, and 
components of fund bal
ances will be recorded on the 
university
 
books, and all accounts will be 
appropriately approved and maintained according to

Inspection and Review of Studen
t Records
:
 
 
 
1.
 
FERPA provides students with the right to inspect and review (within 45 days of request) 
information contained in their education records (as defined above), challenge the contents of 
their education records and to have a hearing if the out
come of the challenge is unsatisfactory 
(see below), and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the 
decisions of the hearing panels to be unacceptable. 
 
 
2.
 
The 
Office of the R
egistrar has been designated by the 
universi
ty
 
to coordinate the inspection 
and review procedures for student education records. Such records are maintained at several 
locations on the campus. The official custodians and their 
o
ffices which may be contacted for 
access to the various types of student
 
records are listed in the 
Student Handbook
.  [A written 
request may be required. If the student is uncertain as to the location of a particular record, a 
written request should be addressed
 
to the Registrar identifying the item or items of interest.

the record by an appropriate 
university
 
official. Such copies will be made at no cost to the 
stude
nt unless the costs exceed $50.00. 
 
 
4.
 
Students may not inspect and review the following, as specified in FERPA: financial 
information submitted by their parents; confidential letters and recommendations associated 
with admissions, employment or job place
ment, or honors to which they have waived their 
rights of inspection and review; or education records containing information about more than 
one student, in which case the institution will permit access only to that part of the record 
which pertains to the
 
inquiring student. The 
university
 
is not required to permit students to 
inspect and review confidential letters and recommendations placed in their files prior to 
January 1, 1975, providing those letters were collected under established policies of 
confid
entiality and were used only for the purposes for which they were collected. 
 
 
F.
 
Amendment of Student Record
s
:
 
 
If a student believes that the information contained in the 

y or other rights, 
the student may request that the 
university
 
amend the record. Such request shall be in writing 
addressed to the Registrar, and shall specify the amendment sought. 
For f
urther information 
regarding the process for consideration of such a 
request, which is distinct from a grade appeal 
governed by the policies and procedures outlined in the 
Student Handbook
, 
students may consult 
the 
Office of the 
Registrar, who has available 
copies of the statute and the Department of

Services, the following rules and regul
ations apply regarding the operation of vehicles on NMSU 
premises.  [The NMSU Police Department shall enforce the vehicle operation policies in this Section, 
consistent with state traffic laws.  [On the public rights of way located on campus, the traffic law
s of 
state of New Mexico shall apply and be enforced by the NMSU Police Department in accordance with 
state law.  [ 
 
 
A.
 
Vehicles Abandoned or Unlicensed on Campus
:
  [
No abandoned or unlicensed motor vehicle(s) 
including motorcycles, motor scooters or mopeds
 
shall be allowed to remain on NMSU property. 
 
 
1.
 
A vehicle is considered abandoned if it is left unattended and not moved from its current

Establishment of Controlled Access Areas for Motoriz
ed Vehicles
 
[Adopted by 
Administrative Council 12.11.07
, with e
ffective
 
date of
 
01.08.08; 
r
atified by Board of Regents 
07.15.08] 
 
 
A.
 
Background
:
  [
The operation of motorized vehicles (electric or combustion engine) in a university 
setting is always a challeng
e between providing adequate access to enable the operational needs of 
the campus to be met versus the pedestrian nature and desired feel of a campus setting. If the rules 
established are too restrictive then day to day operations of a campus are harmed. I
f no restrictions 
are in place then vehicles are daily operated in a manner that is not in the best overall interest of 
the institution. 
 
 
B.
 
Legal Basi
s
:
  [
State law establishes the ability for local jurisdictions to place restrictions on the 
operation of mot
orized vehicles on controlled access areas. The enforcement of these restrictions, 
once established, falls to the police department. Violations of these controlled access restrictions 
will be cited in accordance with state law. 
 
 
C.
 
Need for Controlled Access
:
  [
Operation of motorized vehicles on sidewalks is a direct conflict 
with their primary intended use for pedestrian traffic. Furthermore it damages the sidewalks 
resulting in increased cost to maintain this infrastructure in a reasonable condition. Operati
on of 
motorized vehicles on turf areas damages turf and trees, thereby harming the investment made in 
the establishment and maintenance of our landscaped areas of the campus. 
 
 
D.
 
Valid Reasons for Access
:
  [
There are valid reasons for operating motorized vehi
cles within 
controlled access areas: 
 
 
1.
 
Motorized wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (Segway Human Transporters), or 
other motorized equipment used to provide disabled access. 
 
 
2.
 
Response to emergencies.  [Emergencies include any action to prote
ct human life; well being 
and to prevent potential damage to property or to respond to utility outages. 
 
 
3.
 
Deliveries to or transport from specified buildings otherwise inaccessible. It is recognized that

Def
ined project specific access
:
  [
Certain activities such as movement of heavy loads, athletic 
events, special events, projects involving the remodel or construction of campus facilities and 
infrastructure require, by their very nature, limited entry to contr
olled access areas of the campus. 
This access route will be established by the project manager as best possible and signed 
accordingly during the course of the event/project life. 
 
 
F
.
 
Use of Turf Vehicles
:
  [
Maintenance of the campus turf areas requires ac
cess by specialized turf 
vehicles.  [Nothing in this rule is intended to restrict access to turf areas by these vehicles. 
 
 
G
.
 
Non
-
emergency Access by Police, Fire and Shuttle Vehicle
s
:
 
 
Access rights are given to Police 
and Fire response vehicles for traini
ng activities and patrol activities when access will increase the 
safety of campus population and its real property assets. Limited access on approved routes is 
granted to vehicles providing shuttle service to the NMSU campus.

and includes such vehicles as 
golf carts, turf 
vehicles and small rough terrain vehicles 
which operate at speeds under 20 mph, and which 
are 
allowed on controlled access areas and/or s
treets of the campus.
 
U
tility carts are used to 
efficiently 
move people, deliver supplies, and carry tools or small equipment throughout the workplace. 
 
 
B.
 
Training 
for Utility Cart Operators
: 
Operation of utility carts on sidewalks poses risk to 
pedestrians
 
and therefore requires special training and responsibility to prevent incidents and 
potential injury. All individuals operating utility carts must be trained before using the vehicles.
  [
Reading and understanding the Utility Cart Safety Program and respons
ibilities of cart operation 
plus additional machine specific use instruction will serve as the required training to be 
administered by each department or area utilizing utility carts.
 
 
C.
 
Training for Operators of Other Low Speed Vehicles
:  [
Other low speed ve
hicles capable of 
exceeding 20 mph must be primarily operated over roadways, not controlled access areas. 
Individuals operating low speed roadway use vehicles will be required to attend Defensive Driving 
and be permitted according to the 
NMSU Vehicle Use Procedures

E.
 
General  [Principles: 
 
 
1.
 
Early Reporting and Intervention: While potential incidents of violence are at the forefront of 
concern, this policy is intended to address individual behaviors that may be, or may bec
ome, a 
disruption to the environment, whether classroom, office, housing or other university facility.  [
Outreach at an early stage is desirable to prevent violence in some instances, and to retain an 
employee or student in more instances.  [This policy is t
herefore designed to encourage the 
reporting of behaviors of concern before they lead to violence or other serious harm.  [In the 
unfortunate event that a critical incident should occur, administrators are not relieved of their 
duties under other policies a
nd protocols (e.g. emergency notification and response; support to 
victims of violence; internal and/or police investigation into alleged misconduct; and 
student/employee disciplinary action and/or punitive consequences, including arrest). 
 
 
a.
 
Any person, in
cluding university employees and students, who observes behavior of 
concern is encouraged to submit a report under this policy. 
 
b.
 
Persons who in good faith submit a report or take other action authorized by this policy 
shall not be subjected to adverse acti
on for having done so.
 
 
c.
 
It is acknowledged that some individuals may be both student and employee; in those 
situations, action will be taken in the best interest of the individual and the institution, 
and may include administrative action under either stud
ent policies/procedures or 
employee policies/procedures, or both. 
 
d.
 
As part of a larger and institution
-
wide commitment to a secure campus and workplace 
environment, the university is committed to the development of preventive measures.  [In 
addition to the 
work of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and/or 
NMSU Police Chief and/or designee; other examples include: pre
-
employment screening, 
employee assistance program, student support services, and other outreach and 
educational initiatives. 
  [ 
 
e.
 

-
Employee Management Services 
provides collaborative problem
-
solving assistance to supervisors and employees in the 
area of conflict resolution in an attempt to address and diffuse tensions caused by 
in
terpersonal disputes or other reasons, before disputes in the workplace reach a level at

concern that do not pose an immediate
 
threat of personal harm (to self or others), nor to 
property.  [These committees have been established in part to facilitate the assembly of 
information from the distinct NMSU entities that may be privy to relevant information, in 
order to assist with the 
assessment for risk of harm. The CARE Committee defers to the 
Behavioral Intervention Team and other qualified professionals the decision making regarding 
the nature and type of appropriate responsive action. 
 
 
a.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Interve
ntion Team do not provide counseling 
or medical advice or services, but each may act to refer individuals to such internal or 
external resources, especially in situations involving victims of violence.  [
 
b.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention T
eam are not responsible for 
responding to campus emergencies.  [Emergency response is performed by the appropriate 
public safety entities (e.g. police or fire), with consequence management (continuity of 
operations and disaster recovery) addressed by the Ce
ntral Administration Response 

See
 
Policy 2.25
) 
However, the CART or other public safety professional may request information or 
assistance from either the
 
CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team as 
needed when responding to or managing an emergency. This provision is not intended to 
affect or otherwise limit the authority of the individual members of the Behavioral 
Intervention Team to act in the
ir professional capacity, or to take emergency medical 
action as permitted by state law.
 
c.
 
The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with other 
university offices and resources to publicize, throughout the NMSU system, the purpose 
and
 
functions of the committee and the protocols in place for reporting behavior of 
concern, including new employee and new student orientation at all campuses. 
 
d.
 
The members of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are 
authorized to obtain i
nformation pertaining to a matter pending review by the committee 
or team about individuals from supervisors of the NMSU entities and from students for 
relevant information; supervisors and students shall respond cooperatively and timely to 
such requests, 
for the benefit of the person involved as well as for that of the institution. 
 
e.
 
The Office of General Counsel provides legal counsel to the CARE Committee and the 
Behavioral Intervention Team, and is included in their meetings as an 
ex officio
 
member.

Principles
 
 
Both individual members of the 
university
 
and entities controlled by the 
university
 
have a vital need to 
recognize 
and deal with conflicts of interest and/or commitment.  [Such conflicts may compromise or 
have the appearance of compromising the integrity of 
university
-
related activities and have unforeseen 
effects on those activities.  [Even if there is no perceptible ef
fect on the activity, any apparent inability 
of the 
university
 
to avoid and/or resolve conflicts of interest invites outside criticism and supervision.  [
Such supervision could result in the loss of the 

 
ability to decide its own direction.  [
Con

for non
-
monetary self
-
interest.  [Such conflicts may be personal or relate primarily to the institution or 
its constituent organizations or involve an individu
al whose behavior is inextricably linked with her or 
his official position, such as an upper
-
level administrator or a member of the 
Board of Regents
.  [In any 
of these situations, the general principles remain the same; 1) disclose always, 2) manage when 
po
ssible; and 3) prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible.
 
 
A.
 
Disclose always:
  [
It is vitally important that individuals provide a clear picture of their activities 
and complete forms accurately and in a factually correct manner so that pot
ential or actual 
conflicts of interest can be identified.  [Similarly, if situations change, disclosure needs to be made 
within 15 working days 
(
see
 
section 3.20.
15
 
of this policy
).
  [
The 
university
 
is under no obli
gation 
to manage, as opposed to prohibit, a conflict of interest disclosed by someone other than the 
individuals primarily involved.
 
 
B.
 
Manage when possible
:  [The vast majority of conflicts can and are managed through removing at 
least one of the parties fro
m the conflict situation.  [For example, an individual might recuse him or 
herself from the review process on a proposal, have another individual become principal 
investigator or abstain from participating in a particular promotion or tenure situation.  [The
 
preference of the institution will be to provide management solutions to a conflict of interest that 
will remove or isolate the conflict.  [However, such management is not possible when disclosure is 
not made.
 
 
C.
 
Prohibit when necessary and where management 
is not possible
:  [In some few cases, it will not be 
possible to manage a conflict and the individual or organization will have to withdraw from the 

NMSU Policy Manual
 
Chapte
r

of

activity.  [In some cases, 
university
 
policy and/or state or federal law allows no solution other than 
prohib
ition.  [For example, no member of the 
Board of Regents
 
may act as a vendor of goods or 
ser
vice
s to the 
university

]
 
 
It is the responsibility of all persons covered by this policy to report any real, apparent or potential 
conflict of interest or commitment to their sup
ervisor
s
. The primary means of doing this is through the 
completion of the Conflict of Interest Disclosure 
F
orm upon hire and on an annual basis, with 
disclosure updates submitted on the basis of changes in circumstance. Additional policies, as set forth 
i
n Section 
3.21.26
 
of this policy, are applicable to conflicts arising from 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities but are 
based upon the annual disclosure requirement.
 
 
A.
 
Procedure:
 
Each person covered by this policy is required
 
to complete, sign and submit a Conflict 
of Interest Disclosure form upon hire with any NMSU entity; as new conflicts arise during 
employment by NMSU; and on an annual basis as requested by 
the Office of 
Human Resource 
Ser
vice
s. 
Completed
 
forms will be 
rev
iewed and 
approved by the applicable 
supervisor (and only 
require next level supervisor review as defined below).  [Disclosure forms submitted containing no 
conflicts require only one level of review and approval. Disclosure forms submitted containing 
one o
r more (real or perceived) conflicts of interest require two levels of review and approval. In 
addition, a plan to manage or eliminate the conflict(s) must be submitted. If a conflict of interest or 
commitment exists for which no 
management
 
plan is possibl
e, the supervisor is required to 
recommend a plan of action. Conflicts of interest and c
ommitment
 
that have been submitted may 
be reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as necessary. 
Maintenance of the form is the respon
sibility of the Office of Human Resource Ser
vice
s.
 
 
B.
 
Paths 
T
owards 
R
emedies:
 
There are two basic conditions that influence the path taken to remedy a 
conflict of interest or commitment. These may be summed up in the questions: 1) did the conflict 
arise a
s part of a sponsored activity? and 2) who disclosed the conflict? These questions must be 
asked together, as a conflict may be self
-
disclosed or disclosed by others and may or may not arise 
as part of a sponsored activity.
 
 
 
The first question that determ
ines disposition of conflicts of interest and/or commitment is 
whether or not the conflict arises from a sponsored activity. The treatment of conflicts in non
-
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities will follow normal personnel procedures as outlined in section 
4.05
 
and 
4.25
 
of the 
p
olicy 
m
anual, drawing informally on the ad
vice
 
of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest 
in Sponsored Activities as desired. Resolution of conflicts arising from 
s
ponsore
d 
a
ctivities shall 
be governed by the procedures set forth in section 
3.21.27
 
of this policy. The second question is 
whether the individual(s) involved in the conflict made the disclosure prospectively 
or as part of a 
timely update, or whether someone else has brought the conflict to the 

 
attention. In 
cases disclosed by the individual(s) having the conflict, the 
university
 
will generally try to manage 
the conflict in a manner agreeable to th
e parties involved and in agreement with applicable 
university
 
policies and state and federal laws. The person(s) identified as having the conflict may 
elect to manage the conflict by participating in measures that will guard the integrity of the 
situation
. Such measures require the approval of the relevant dean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
vice
 
provost
 
or (in the case of 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored 
Activities). The person(s) involved may choose or be told to withdraw fro
m the activity or 
situation that creates the conflict. In some cases, the supervisor and appropriate 
d
ean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
vice
 
provost
 
and, if applicable, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored 
Activities, shall approve the action taken. Wh
en someone other than the individual(s) involved in 
the conflict brings an existing conflict to the attention of the 
university,
 
the 
university
 
is under no 
obligation to try to remedy the conflict and may require that the individual(s) withdraw from the 
ac
tivity or situation creating the conflict. In addition, the individual(s) may be required to repay 
monies that have been obtained in a situation involving a conflict of interest or commitment. Other 
sanctions up to and including termination of an individua

to the appeals process outlined in sections 
4.05
 
and 
4.25

Members of a family may be employed by the 
university

Faculty or Staff as Students
 
 
When a 
university
 
faculty or staff member enrolls in a program to earn a degree at the 
university,
 
a 
potential for conflict of interest may arise as a result of the dual role a
s student and as a faculty or staff 
member.  [Persons in this status who are seeking degrees or certificates must demonstrate that the 
potential for conflict of interest will not compromise the quality of their program of study.  [Approval 
of cognizant depar
tment heads and deans will be required.  [In any case, supervisors should never have 
the responsibility of grading individuals whom they supervise.
 
 
In the case of graduate degrees or certificates, such programs must also be approved on a case

basis
 
by the dean of the Graduate School with the concurrence of the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  [When appropriate, the dean may confer with the Graduate Council about the potential for 
conflict of interest in such programs.  [The graduate dean may req
uire a specific representative on such 
a graduate committee, possibly including off campus representatives, as a condition for approving 
programs.

Requests Made to Subordinates
 
 
In order to prevent individuals from being placed in a position of conflict between the needs of the 
institution and those of supervis
ors, persons in a position of supervisory authority over another 
individual may not ask that individual to perform duties that benefit the supervisor or a family member 
in a way that does not directly relate to the official duties of the employee or superv
isor.  [An example 
of such a request would be for a supervisor, including a faculty member, to ask that a subordinate 
nominate the supervisor or anyone else for an award.  [Another example might be suggesting that a 
subordinate purchase something to support

Conflicts of Interest and
 
Commitment in Sponsored Activities
 
 
Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment that arise from Sponsored Activities are of 
special concern because they almost always involve or implicate entities outside of the 
university
 
community (and thus 
are more prone to public scrutiny), are frequently governed not only by 
university
 
policies but also by governmental conflict

interest regulations and are subject to special

.  [Specific 
guidance on conflicts of interest in

3.21.21
 
Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Financial Interests
 
 
Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment in 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities gene
rally arise when an 
investigator or family member has a significant financial interest in, or a consulting arrangement with, 
a private business concern or other organization that is or may be affected by the sponsored activity.  [
Some examples of this kind 
of conflict situation include, but are not limited to:
 
 

 
Engaging for sponsored research a business firm in which the investigator or family member 
involved in the research project has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Purchasing major equipment, instrument
s, materials or other items for sponsored research from a 
private firm in which the investigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Engaging a private consulting f
i
rm in connection with sponsored research where the investigator 
involved in such research has a consulting arrangement with or significant financial interest in a 
competing consulting f
i
rm.
 

 
Acceptance by an investigator involved in a sponsored research project of gratuities or special 
favors from a firm or other organi
zation with which the 
university
 
does business in connection 
with the sponsored research.
 

 
Utilization of privileged information acquired by an investigator in connection with sponsored 
research for personal gain, or to economically benefit a business conce
rn in which the investigator 
or family member has a significant financial interest.
 

 
Sponsorship of research by a business firm in which an investigator involved in the research has a 
significant financial interest.
 

 
In the absence of disclosure and express 
sponsor approval, employment of, or an offer of 
employment to, a family member of an investigator involved in sponsored research by either the 
sponsor of, or an organization engaged in, the research project.
 

 
Receipt by a family member of an investigator in
volved in a sponsored activity of a scholarship, 
fellowship, work/study benefit, or other financial aid, which is funded by or through the sponsored 
activity.
 
 
3.21.22
 
Conflicts in Sponsored Activities that Arise from Personal Interest
 
 
An actual or percei
ved conflict of interest or commitment may also arise from situations that may have 
a significant impact on an investigator involved in sponsored research, even though the situation does 
not involve a significant financial interest.  [These non
-
financial co
nflict situations frequently involve 
personal interests or relationships that are or may be affected by 
s
ponsored 
a
ctivities.  [Some examples 
are:
 
 

 

of the invest
igator acts as a non
-
paid advisor to, or board member of, the sponsoring entity.
 

 

human subject, student researcher or other non
-
paid participant.
 

 
An investigator

technology developed by a family member of the investigator.
 
 
3.21.24
 
Other Conflict Situations in Sponsored Activities
 
 
It is important to realize that any number of other 
kinds of conflict situations can arise in the context of 
sponsored projects, some of which may be undeterminable at the outset of the project.  [Investigators 
involved in sponsored activities must be cognizant of the need to monitor project developments in 
order to identify potential or perceived conflict situations as they arise and to disclose them or facilitate 
their disclosure as soon as possible.  [Examples of other kinds of conflict situations might include:
 
 

 

 
research project becomes so extensive during the 
course of the project that other obligations to the 
university
 
are neglected, thus creating a conflict

Governmental Conflict of Interest Regulations Concerning Sponsored Activities
 
 
Any research or other project that is sponso
red or funded by a governmental agency is likely to be 
subject to agency regulations or guidelines covering conflicts of interest as well as 
university
 
policies.  [
The federal Office of Management and Budget has promulgated rules, applicable to all federall
y 
funded grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, which define conflicts of interest 
and the financial thresholds applicable to them and which require grant recipients to maintain written 
standards of conduct governing real or apparent 
conflicts of interest.  [These rules are found in OMB 
Circular No. A
-
110, Sec. 42.  [Most federal departments and independent agencies have formally 
adopted these rules and codified them in various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations.  [A few 
agencies
 
have adopted supplementary conflict of interest guidelines applicable to their own grant 
administration procedures.  [Two agencies, the National Science Foundation and the Public Health 
Ser
vice
, have established specific financial disclosure requirements a
nd disclosure review and conflict 
of interest management procedures applicable to grants from those agencies.  [The guidelines and 
requirements set forth in this 
S
ection 
3.21
 
are intended to implement and comply wit
h these federal 
conflict of interest rules, so that compliance with this 
university
 
policy will generally assure 
compliance with governmental requirements.  [Investigators are urged, however, to familiarize 
themselves with the conflict of interest rules ado
pted by agencies sponsoring their research activities.
 
 
3.21.26
 
Disclosure Procedures for Sponsored Activities
 
 
Each person engaged in an area of sponsored research and covered by this policy is responsible for 
determining whether any actual, potential or 
apparent conflict of interest or commitment exists
.
  [
The 
principal investigator of each specific sponsored activity, in consultation with all other participants in 
the activity, is responsible for determining whether any possible conflicts exist with respe

activity and for so indicating on the New Mexico State

There is no potential conflict of interest; or
 
b.
 
There was a conflict of interest, which has since been resolved; or
 
c.
 
There is a conflict of interest that has not been resolved.

Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships
 
 
A.
 
Policy Statement:
  [
It is the policy of the 
universi
ty
 
that employees with direct teaching, 
supervisory, advisory or evaluative responsibility over other employees, students and/or student 
employees recognize and respect the ethical and professional boundaries that must exist in such 
situations.  [Consensual
 
relationships can create conflicts of interest that impair the integrity of 
academic and employment decisions.  [Such relationships also contain the potential for exploitation 
of the subordinate employee, student or student employee and the possible profes
sional or 
academic disadvantage of third parties, and can subject both the 
university
 
and individuals to 
liabili
ty.  [Therefore, the 
university
 
strongly discourages consensual relationships between 
supervisors and subordinates, teachers and students, and ad
visors and students.  [Should such a 
relationship develop, the faculty member, supervisor or advisor has the obligation to disclose its 
existence to an immediate supervisor and cooperate in making alternative arrangements for the 
supervision, evaluation, te
aching, grading or advising of the employee, student or student 
employee.
 
 
 
B.
 
Scope:
  [
This policy applies to all NMSU employees including faculty, staff and student 
employees.
 
 
 
C.
 
Definitions:
  [
 
 
1.
 
A consensual relationship is a mutually acceptable, romant
ic and/or sexual relationship.
 
 
2.
 
A conflict of interest arises when an individual with the authority and responsibility to 
evaluate the work or performance of an employee, student or student employee acquiesces or 
engages in a consensual relationship with t
he employee or student. 
 
 
3.
 
An employee is defined as any individual, whether paid or not, who is listed and active on the 
university

H
uman 
R

M
anagement System.  [This includes all faculty, staff and 
student employees to include affiliated faculty a
nd associated employees.
 
 
D.
 
Reporting Responsibility:
  [
In the event a conflict of interest exists arising from a consensual 
relationship, the individual in the supervisory, teaching or advisory position shall immediately 
notify 
the
 
supervisor 
about
 
the re
lationship and cooperate with the supervisor in making 
arrangements necessary to resolve the conflict of interest.  [Notification of the
 
consensual
 
relationship shall be provided in writing and signed by both parties involved.
 
 
E.
 
Supervisor Responsibility
:
  [
A supervisor who is notified shall take immediate steps to alter the 
conditions that create the conflict of interest caused by the relationship.  [In most instances, this 
will be accomplished by providing an alternative means for the supervision, teaching
, advising 
and/or evaluation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee.  [A supervisor who 
becomes aware of a consensual relationship that has not been 
declared
 
shall investigate and take 
action as appropriate and required by this policy.  [Bo
th parties in the relationship and the 
supervisor shall sign the resolution.  [All documentation will be maintained in a departmental file.  [
 
 
F.
 
Failure to Report or Cooperate
:  [Employees in positions of authority who enter into or continue 
consensual rela
tionships without reporting them, or who fail to cooperate in efforts to eliminate 
the conflict of interest resulting from a consensual relationship may be subject to disciplinary 
action, which may include counseling, letters of warning, reprimand, suspens
ion or termination.  [
In the event that a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct is reported by the 
subordinate party regarding an unreported relationship, there will be no presumption that the 
relationship was consensual in nature.

be safeguarded
 
to the extent that an undue financial hardship is not imposed on the

Distribution of Effort
 
 
There are competing demands on the energies of a faculty member 
(for instance, research, teaching, 
committee work, outside consulting).  [The way in which a faculty member divides effort among these 
various functions does not raise ethical questions unless the 
university
 
or government, industrial, or 
business agency sup
porting the research is misled in its understanding of the amount of intellectual 
effort actually devoted to the research in question.  [A system of precise time accounting is 
incompatible with the inherent character of the work of a faculty member, since t
he various functions 
performed are closely interrelated and do not conform to any meaningful division of a standard work 
week.  [On the other hand, if the research agreement contemplates that a staff member will devote a 
certain fraction of effort to the go
vernment, industrial, or business
 
sponsored research, a demonstrable 
relationship between the indicated effort of responsibility and the actual extent of involvement is to 
be
 
expected.  [Research administering agencies in the 
university
 
have established sim
ple procedures of 
accounting which indicate the proportion of the investigator's time spent on sponsored research.  [Each 
administering agency will inform the investigator of the procedures developed to assure that proposals 
are responsibly made and complie

It is the policy of New Mexico State 
U
niversity
 
t
o provide an atmosphere free of sexual harassment for 
all faculty, staff, students, and visitors.
 
 
According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Office for Civil 
Rights, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, an
d other verbal or physical conduct of 
a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either 
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual

s employment or academic progress; (2) 
students

 
educational
 
pursuits are adversely impacted; (3) submission to or rejection of such conduct 
by an individual is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting such individual; 
(4) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering wi
th an individual

s academic or 
work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or learning environment.  [
Harassing conduct based on gender often is sexual in nature, but sometimes is not.  [Any unwelcome 
conduct based on gender i
s also forbidden by this policy regardless of whether the individual engaged 
in harassment and the individual being harassed are of the same or different gender.  [Common forms of 
harassment include offensive or abusive physical contact, joking, lewd langua
ge, suggesting sexual 
favors, displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, magazines, calendars, etc. 
 
 
A.
 
Hostile Work/Academic Environment
:  [A student or employee may file a claim based on sexually 
offensive conduct that is sufficiently severe and/o
r pervasive to create a hostile work or academic 
environment.  [A hostile work or academic environment based on unwelcome attention, leers, or 
remarks of a sexual nature may also be grounds for sexual harassment. The 
university
 
extends this 
protection to st
udents in the classroom or in any academic
-
related settings.  [Hostile environment 
harassment based on discrimination should be referred to the 
director of the Office of 
Institutional 
Equity/EEO
.  [Non
-
discriminatory hostile environment issues are regarded m
anagement matters 
under the purview of the appropriate administrator.
 
 
B.
 
Retaliation
: Any 
university
 
employee or student may report violations of this policy without fear 
of retribution.  [The 
university
 
prohibits retaliation against individuals because th
ey have in good 
faith:  [(1) opposed any discriminatory or employment practice covered by 
university
 
policies/procedures or state/federal laws; (2) filed a complaint of discrimination or grievance with 
the 
Office of Institutional Equity/EEO 
or external stat
e/federal agency with statutory jurisdiction 
over discrimination filings; (3) reported a discriminatory matter to a supervisor; or, (4) testified, 
assisted with, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing protected under same.  [

Such retali
ation in and of itself may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
 
 
C.
 
Grievances
: Persons who feel they have been harassed should whenever possible first approach 
the person or persons engaging in the inappropriate conduct indicati
ng that the conduct is 
unwelcome.  [If the unwelcome behavior persists, the aggrieved should either report the complaint 
to the appropriate supervisor or the 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
director
.  [All sexual harassment 
complaints made to a person in a position
 
of authority must be reported to the 
director of the 
Office of 
Institutional Equity/EEO
 
(or the human resource ser
vice
s
 
director
 
if uncomfortable 
reporting the complaint to the 
director or the Office of

) immediately, 
regardless of
 
whether or not permission was given by the party subjected to the harassment.  [
Allegations of sexual harassment are to be reported within 15 working days of occurrence, unless 
extenuating circumstances warrant exception.  [All employees and students should
 
be aware that 
the 
university
 
is prepared to take action in a timely manner to prevent and remedy such behavior, 
and that individuals who engage in such behavior are subject to disciplinary action.  [Any 
disciplinary action may be appealed through the appro
priate procedure.  [To the extent possible, 
every effort will be made to safeguard confidentiality, consistent with reporting obligations and 
the need to investigate promptly and thoroughly.  [Contact

Sanctions
: Individuals who engage in sexual harassment, or supervisors who neglect to control the 
work environment and/or learning environment, will be held accountable.  [If 
it is determined that a 
violation of this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary action, training, and other measures 
will be taken to remedy the situation.  [All individuals are required to cooperate with any 
investigation in response to an allegati
on of harassment.  [Refusal to cooperate in an investigation

3.
 
Stay of Proceedings:  [With the concurrence of the Office of the General Counsel, a grievance 
may be st
ayed by the chair of the Faculty Grievance Review Board when the grievant is also 
seeking relief based upon the same set of facts in another forum, or agrees to explore 
alternative dispute resolution outside the scope of this policy.  [The matter may be re
-

i.
 
Under no circumstances will a Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing 
panel member participat
e in a hearing convened to hear a grievance from a person

Faculty Grievance Review Board member shall not mediate, nor hear, a matter 
involving faculty from their own NMSU
 
entity.
 
ii.
 
If one or more of the witnesses has a close relationship with one of the hearing panel 
members, disqualification of the hearing panel member from service shall not be 
automatic, but shall be decided based upon the specific facts of each case.

If t
he grievant or a witness has had prior contact with either the assigned mediator or 
a hearing panel member, disqualification or the mediator or panel member from 
service shall not be automatic, but shall be decided based upon the specific facts of 
each cas

order that it may resolved prior to the informal or formal grievance processes.
 
ii.
 
A party shall also raise the issue of an actual or potential conflict of interest on the 
part of a mediator or hearing board member as 
soon as the conflict is known.
 
iii.
 
After consideration of the relevant facts and positions of the parties, if it is 
determined that a conflict exists sufficient to call into question the impartiality of the 
Faculty Grievance Review Board member, the resolution
 
will be either voluntary 
recusal by the member of the Faculty Grievance Review Board alleged to have the 
conflict, or by substitution of a different member by the chair of the Faculty 
Grievance Review Board.
 
 
c.
 
Process to Resolve Alleged Conflict of Interes
t:  [In the event a conflict of interest issue is 
raised and not resolved amicably by substitution of another board member, the chair of 
the Faculty Grievance Review Board, the mediator or the hearing panel chair, as 
appropriate, shall give notice of the po
tential conflict to the parties and proceed to resolve 
the issue as expeditiously as possible.
 
 
i.
 
If a challenged Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel member 
agrees that the conflict is sufficient to render the member unable to participat
e in a

ii.
 
If the challenged Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel 
member disagrees that there is a conflict sufficient to affect impartiality, the matter 
wil
l be decided by the chair of the Faculty Senate.
 

 
Each party may provide their position on the issue, and to comment on the 
position of the other party.  [Other evidence may be considered if relevant or 
needed to decide the issue; however, the parties are en
titled to know and 
comment on any other evidence considered by the chair of Faculty Senate in 
making the decision.
 

 
If a Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator or hearing panel member is 
excused based on a finding of conflict of interest, another Faculty G
rievance 
Review Board member shall be selected to serve.

7.
 
Filing and Storage of Grievance/Hearing Records:  [The Faculty Senate Chair, together with 
the Offices of HRS, with guidance from the Office of General Couns
el as needed, shall ensure 
that the official grievance record documentation (consisting of official grievance, any written 
response, official correspondence, evidence submitted for hearing and final decision but NOT 
INCLUDING anything from an unsuccessful 
mediation session) is maintained as follows:
 
 
a.
 
The grievance record is typically voluminous, and shall not be filed in the official 
personnel file, but will be housed in a grievance file with the Office of Human Resource 
Services.  [Occasionally, it may be a
ppropriate to file or to cross reference a grievance 
decision
 
in the official personnel file (i.e. to justify a mandated change in salary).
 
b.
 
If the grievant prevails on an issue affecting a document contained in the official 
personnel file, that document wi
ll be revised and the original document will be moved to 
the grievance file, to document compliance with the decision on the grievance.
 
c.
 
Copies of the final administrative decision, which may be a Mediation Agreement, shall 
be stored permanently in the Offi
ce of the Executive Vice President and Provost.

under this policy is strictly prohibited.  [Any such claim shall be reported immediately to the 
Assistant Vice President of Human Resource Services.
  [
Such claims will be taken seriously, 
investigated independently, and if substantiated, will be grounds for corrective or disciplinary 
action, appropriate to the circumstances.

Procedures to Initiate Grievance:
  [
After internal communications between ind
ividuals with 
authority to resolve the grievance have failed to resolve a disagreement or dispute that has been 
identified to the department head as a potential grievance, a faculty member may initiate a formal 
grievance by delivering a memo with the subje

Faculty Grievance Review Board, through the Faculty Senate chair. A copy shall also be delivered 
by the grievant to the department head, cognizant dean or equivalent administrator, and assistant 
vice preside
nt of human resource services.  [Throughout grievance proceedings, communications 
between one party and any member of the Faculty Grievance Review Board shall be copied to the 
other party as well as the assistant vice president of human resource services. E
xamples include 
requests for extensions of time and the responses thereto, supplemental submittals if permitted, 
notices of appeal. The grievance should be initiated within thirty (30) days from the date of the 
action or inaction being grieved, or from the
 
time the faculty member reasonably should have 
known about the action/inaction subject of the grievance. This time limit for submitting a 
grievance will be interpreted liberally in order to encourage informal resolution. The chair of 
Faculty Senate may al
so grant, in writing to all parties, an extension of the deadline, for 
extenuating circumstances, or if so doing facilitates pre
-
grievance resolution.  [The memo initiating 
the grievance resolution process shall:
 
 
1.
 
Identify the issue in dispute;
 
 
2.
 
Identify in
volved parties and provide email and physical address of the grievant to which 
official grievance correspondence should be sent;
 
 
3.
 
Identify efforts made to date to resolve dispute;
 
 
4.
 

points contra;
 
 
5.
 
Attach or reference any supporting documentation; and
 
 
6.
 
State the remedy requested.
 
 
I.
 
Procedures to Determine Jurisdiction:
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board Chair shall convene a 
quorum of the board to review the grievance and determine whe
ther or not the matter(s) alleged 
state a grievable claim within the purview of this policy. Typically, the Faculty Grievance Review 
Board Chair will issue the official correspondence to the parties; however, as agreed by the 
members, any member may issue 
the written determination to the grievant on behalf of the Faculty 
Grievance Review Board, provided it is reflective of what the majority decided.  [The 
determination to accept or decline a grievance shall be issued in writing to all parties within ten 
days
 
from the date the grievance was received by the Faculty Grievance Review Board Chair.  [A 

-
EMS 

etermination may be 
appealed by either party within three days from receipt to Assistant Vice President of Human 
Resource Services, who will issue a written decision letter sent to all parties within five days from 
receipt of the appeal.
 
 
J.
 
Procedures for In
formal Resolution/Mediation:
 
The purpose of the mediation phase of this 
grievance procedure is to explore whether or not mediation or other alternate method of dispute 
resolution might resolve the grievance and obviate the need for the formal hearing and d
ecision 
making process.
 
 
1.
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board member selected (
See Section F. 5.
)  [to coordinate the 
mediation  [phase of the grievance may serve as mediator, or, if warranted by the facts alleged 
or the parties involved, and with the approval
 
from the Faculty Grievance Review Board 
chair, may utilize a mediator external to the Faculty Grievance Review Board to conduct the 
pre
-
hearing dispute resolution (mediation) phase of the grievance process.
 
 
2.
 
The Faculty Grievance Review Board mediator may
 
conduct the mediation jointly with an 
external mediator; may rely on external mediator(s) to conduct the mediation; and may 
require that more than one mediation session be held.

The Faculty Grievance Review Board member selected to coordinate the mediatio
n phase is 
encouraged to work with the Faculty Senate Chair, the Office of Human Resource Services 
and the Office of General Counsel regarding the logistics of conducting the pre
-
hearing 
dispute resolution session(s), especially with regard to compliance w
ith applicable time 
deadlines.
 
 
4.
 
The mediator(s) shall work directly with the parties and the appropriate NMSU officials, as 
needed, for approval of any mutually agreed upon resolution, if any.
 
 
5.
 
The mediator(s) will provide the parties to the grievance writ
ten ground rules for the pre
-
hearing dispute resolution session(s) prior to or at the commencement of the first mediation 
session. The parties will be asked to read them and to sign, indicating their willingness to 
abide by them.  [If any party refuses, the
 
mediation will be cancelled, and the grievance will be 
submitted to the Faculty Grievance Review Board hearing panel chair for a hearing and 
decision.

the b
ehavior is counterproductive to the mediation, the mediator has the authority to cancel 
the session and elect to submit the matter to the formal hearing stage.
 
 
7.
 
All documentation, information, positions asserted, admissions or concessions shared for 
purpos
es of exploring a pre
-
hearing dispute resolution shall remain confidential and shall not 
be divulged by any party or mediator to any person, including the other members of the 
Faculty Grievance Review Board, nor used against any party at any subsequent hea
ring or 
proceeding. With the exception of a Mediation Agreement, if any, the mediator will ask that 
the parties to leave written documentation behind which the mediator(s) will shred.
 
 
8.
 
The only documentation that shall be retained after mediation is a form
al signed Mediation 
Agreement that documents that a mutually satisfactory agreement was reached by the parties.  [
A Mediation Agreement, outlining the agreement, including the details relating to follow up 
action to be taken, will be drafted during the medi
ation session and shall be signed by all 
parties.  [Ideally, all parties whose authority will be required to resolve the matter will be 
present at the mediated dispute resolution session(s); however, if additional administrative 
approvals will be necessary 

mediator(s) may work outside of the mediation session to obtain the appropriate additional 
approvals or to further formalize the initial agreement. The provisions relating to 
confidentiality contin
ue to apply and each NMSU official consulted regarding the potential 
for settlement shall be advised about the confidential nature of the communications.
 
 
9.
 
If the mediation re
s
olves all or part of a grievance, the signed Mediation Agreement shall be 
filed w
ith the grievance record; each party will be provided with a copy, to facilitate its 
implementation.  [The parties shall agree to maintain it in a secure manner that will not 
jeopardize confidentiality.  [If the mediation does not resolve all of the issues r
aised in the 
grievance, the issues remaining will be submitted for formal hearing.  [Each party has the 
authority to decide whether or not to agree to a Mediation Agreement that resolves only part

president
 
will ask the ad
vice
 
of the 
unit manager and will convene the Emergency Finance Committee and seek its ad
vice
.  [After

vice
 
of the Emergency Finance Committee, the

ident

.  [The 
board
, after receiving the committee report and the recommendation of the

exigency, the

D.
 
Minor Financial Shortfall
:  [In a period of minor financial shortfall in which no financial exigency 
has been declared, the 
university
 
may respond 
on an ad hoc basis the first year.  [If it seems the 
financial shortfall might last a second year, the 
president
 
should consider convening the 
Emergency Finance Committee during the first year.  [In such a case, whether or not a financial 
exigency is declare
d, planning should begin well before the end of the first year that will entail use 
of program review information to make decisions for program reductions that could be partially 
implemented during the second year.  [If minor financial shortfall continues f
or 2 or more years, 
increasing reliance should be placed on planned program reductions.
 
 
E.
 
Policies for Declared Exigency and Minor Financial Shortfall
:  [The following policies will guide 
the Emergency Action Committee, the unit managers, and the 
presiden
t
 
in their decisions:
 
 
F.
 
General
:  [The primary consideration behind all decisions will be to maintain viable, quality, and 
logically defensible programs in keeping with the land
-
grant mission of the 
university.
  [
An attempt 
will be made to maintain a core 
university
 
consisting of the historic components necessary for a 
broad
-
based liberal education. An appropriate balance among faculty, administrative and support 
personnel will be maintained. An appropriate balance among teaching, research, and ser
vice
 
func
tions of the 
university
 
will be maintained.  [Financially self
-
supporting units will generally be 
given priority status.
 
 
G.
 
Human Res
ources Policies
:  [Prior to any layoffs, personnel will be asked to indicate their desires 
with respect to early retirement,
 
part
-
time employment, voluntary resignation, and intra
-
university
 
transfer.  [The 
university
 
shall, to the extent the 
Board of Regents
 
determines practicable, make a 
good faith effort to relocate any employee subject to layoff in a suitable vacant position
 
within the 
university
 
for which that employee is fully qualified.  [This good faith effort to relocate an 
employee need not extend beyond the effective date of the layoff.  [Salary reductions should not be 
used as a means of meeting financial exigency unles
s other options have been considered by the 
board
.  [When programmatic decisions have been made and faculty within a given program are to 
be laid off, where the 
board
 
so determines, and consistent with program need, nontenure
-
track 
faculty will receive lowe
st priority, followed by tenure
-
track faculty, then by tenured faculty.  [
Within each of these categories, layoffs will be based on program need, seniority, and 
performance.  [Once areas have been identified in which 
staff
 
employees are at risk because of 
fi
nancial exigency, probationary employees will be considered for 
layoff first.  [Other layoffs of
 
staff, if necessary, will be based upon seniority and performance within those job classifications or 
job titles identified.  [Specific plans for any area affect
ed by financial exigency will be prepared by 
the unit manager in accordance with the established 
university
 
guidelines before any actions are 
taken.  [Employees who are to be laid off may appeal.  [(
See
 
Grievances
)
  [
Following layoffs due to 
financial exigency, if programmatically defensible, former employees will be considered for rehire 
prior to new hires for a period to be set by the 
university
 
administration.

program, or
 
any other administrative unit composed of or affecting academic personnel, personnel 
on continuous contract, 
or tenure

constraints imposed upon the implementation of program reorganization or elimination will
 
therefore vary.  [In this context, program reorganization is meant to involve actions more 
significant than the transfer or elimination of one or very few positions.  [Consistent with policies 
regarding the approval processes for creation of new academic pr
ograms or name changes (and 
considering such time constraints as may be imposed by financial exigency)
;
 
an opportunity shall 
be provided for the Faculty Senate to hear the arguments for and/or against proposed program 
elimination or reorganization.  [The Fa
culty Senate will then register a vote of agreement or 
disagreement to the proposed program elimination or reorganization, and report this result (with 
rationale and minority reports, if any) to the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and

, and the

R

.  [After receiving and reviewing all relevant information and reports, the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and

will render a decision with respect to program elimination or 
reorganization, which will be final.  [Individual employees affected by 
program elimination or 
reorganization may appeal decisions concerning their positions according to the releva
nt policies 
of this manual.

(

Employees may not engage in outside business activities while on duty.  [Violation of this provision 
may be grounds for involuntary termination.  [Employees holding a part or full

not allow such employment 
to interfere with their performance or attendance.  [If the supervisor can 
reasonably demonstrate that performance or attendance problems are resulting from outside

Supplemental Employment/Compensation
 
 
A.
 
Policy Permitting Supplemental Compensation
:  [
Supplemental compensation may be paid 
to 
faculty 
and staff acting in the capacity of a professional/faculty employee for an additional 
assignment performed during normal 
university
 
working hours, providing that assignment is (1) 
clearly outside the scope of that person

s regular tea
ching, rese
arch
 
and ser
vice
 
responsibilities; 
and 
(2) does not interfe
re with those responsibilities. 
 
Such time will be counted against a faculty 
member

s allowed consulting time and must be approved in advance by all cognizant 
administrators, including the 
executiv
e
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  [Additional compensation is 
submitted for approval by the completion of an 
E
-
Hire Form
.  [This compensation may be 
authorized in addition to regular salary for those employees exempt from overtime provisions of 
the Fair Labor S
tandards Act and is used to authorize payment for consulting, workshops, etc.  [
Supplemental compensation will not be paid solely on the basis that the salary has been budgeted 
into the agreement.
 
 
B.
 
Supplemental Employment Guidelines
:  [
 
 
1.
 
Applicable only to
 
f
aculty, or those staff acting in the capacity of a professional/faculty 
employee.
 
 
2.
 
Applicable only to employees currently employed during the period when the supplemental 
compensation was earned.
 
 
3.
 
The rate of pay should not exceed the employee

s current ra
te of pay in the employee

s 
primary job assignment.  [Under those special circumstances where a request exceeds the 

 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
P
resident
 
and 
P
rovost
 
must be attached t
o the form.  [Hours worked (a) should 
not exceed a reasonable percentage of full
-
time hours (Any percentage greater than 50 percent 
must be justified in an attached memo); (b) must be properly documented per grant/contract 
requirements.
 
 
4.
 
Only in unusual 
cases may an exempt staff and faculty member be paid to work on a grant or 
contract, as consultants or otherwise, if that effort results in payment in excess of 100 percent 
FTE unless specifically provided for, as supplemental compensation, in the agreemen
t or 
approved in writing by the sponsoring agency.  [For federal grants and contracts, approval will 
normally be granted only if two conditions exist:
 
 
a.
 
The work is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote location; and
 
b.
 
The work performed b
y the employee is in addition to 
the 
regular departmental workload.

Academic Freedom
 
 
The quest for truth often leads the scholar into difficult and untried territory.  [As a dealer in ideas, the 
teacher or researcher comes often in conflict with prevailing be
lief of large segments of society and 
even with those of colleagues.  [Yet, because of the practical benefits of scholarly activity, it is 
profoundly important that this diversity of ideas be not only tolerated, but encouraged.  [The right to 
support unortho
dox positions, arrived at through scholarly investigation, free from coercion or 
reprisals, is fundamental to the continued progress of society.  [The right to pursue unpopular lines of 
inquiry and express new and unaccepted ideas falls within the framework
 
of a special set of guarantees 
called academic freedom.  [In granting these guarantees, society expresses a willingness to risk the 
consequences because history confirms that the risk is outweighed by the benefits stemming from such 
a policy.  [Scholars are
 
entitled to full freedom in the conduct of their research and publication of the 
results, and full freedom in the classroom to discuss those topics in which they are professionally 
experts as determined by their credentials.  [The exercise of this freedom 
carries with it the burden of 
corollary responsibilities.  [Scholars must not knowingly misrepresent facts.  [They must be careful in 
their teaching not to introduce controversial matter bearing no relationship to their subjects.  [They must 
exercise appropri
ate restraint and guard against distortions and inaccuracies.  [Outside their academic 
roles, as private citizens, scholars have no special privileges.  [When they speak or write as citizens, 
they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, b
ut their special position in the 
community imposes special obligations.  [As persons of learning and educational officers, they should 
remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances.  [Hence 
they should at all t
imes be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the 
opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the 
institution.  [Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common
 
good and not to further the 
interest of either the individual scholar or the institution as a whole. The 
Board of Regents
 
recognizes 
that it is not possible to define, with any great precision, the limits of academic freedom in the complex 
world of ideas.
  [
The gray areas are practically endless and the final judgment of what is acceptable and 
reasonable must be left by society to the academic community itself.  [The scholar's own colleagues and 
institution must bear the brunt of public criticism, have the m
ost to lose from withdrawal of public 
trust, and are, therefore, in the best position to balance the issues of academic freedom and 
responsibility.

Administrative Reviews 
 
 
Each dean or 
community college
 
executive
 
officer is responsible for preparin
g, scheduling, delivering 
and retaining appropriate administrative reviews of associate deans, department heads, directors and 
their equivalent.  [In addition to annual performance evaluations, administrative reviews are scheduled 
to occur every few years t
o determine an incumbent

s performance as an administrator.  [
Administrative reviews are often coordinated by a third party (such as NMSU

s Institutional Research) 
and may include written evaluation by both internal and external constituents.

Graduate Faculty
 
 
 
 
The ultimate responsibility for the quality of the graduate program resides in the graduate faculty, 
individual departments offering graduate work, and the cognizant dean.  [The dean of 
the 
G
raduate 
School is responsible for the administration of the Graduate School's policies.  [Staff members qualified 
to perform the functions of the graduate faculty are nominated by the heads of their departments for 
approval by the cognizant dean and th
e dean of the Graduate School.  [The Graduate Council shall 
maintain a standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments comprised of three senior graduate 
faculty currently serving on the Graduate Council.  [The standing committee on Graduate Faculty 
Appo
intments shall review and make recommendations to the dean of the Graduate School on 
appointment of faculty nominees to the graduate faculty.  [This standing committee on Graduate 
Faculty Appointments also shall review appointment criteria as needed.  [Appro
val will be granted in 
recognition of the staff member's active interest in graduate work as demonstrated by continual study, 
creative activity, and successful teaching.  [Appointment to the graduate faculty will normally require 
that the individual have an
 
earned doctoral degree.  [The qualifications of each new member of the 
graduate faculty will be given comprehensive review by the department head, cognizant dean, and the 
dean of the Graduate School at the end of 3 years.  [The qualifications of each gradua
te faculty member 
will be reviewed every 3
-
5 years by the department head, cognizant dean, the Graduate Council 
standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments, and the dean of the Graduate School.  [
Selection of instructors to teach courses at the 450
-
499 level is left to the department head and college 
dean; however, such persons must have at least a master's degree.  [Any exceptions to this policy must 
have prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School.  [Graduate students may not assign 
gra
des to other graduate students in courses numbered above 450.  [Selection of individuals to teach 
courses numbered 500 and above is left to the department head and the college dean.  [The individual 
must have an earned doctorate, or a master's degree with ex
tensive experience, and have evidence of 
creative activity.  [Any exceptions to this policy must have the prior written approval of the dean of the 
Graduate School.  [Members of the graduate faculty chair all graduate committees, direct master's 
theses, dire
ct doctoral dissertations, teach 600
-
level courses, serve as representatives of the dean of the 
Graduate School, serve on educational specialists' exams, and serve on doctoral exams.  [Any exception 
to the above policy must be approved in writing by the dea
n of the Graduate School.  [Before an 
individual is appointed to the graduate faculty, evidence of creative activity, in addition to the doctoral 
dissertation, is required.  [In implementing this approach, the department heads, the deans and the dean 
of the 
Graduate School will review all members of the graduate faculty in their colleges and invoke the 
review clause on individuals not meeting the minimum requirements.

time hourly basis is 40 hours per week.  [The full
-
time credit basis is 
12 credits per semester or 24 credits per academic year, except in the community colleges, where

track faculty member employed on an hourly basis is the 
ratio of the number of hours assigned per week to the basis of 40 hours/week.
  [
The FTE fraction 
for a nontenure
-
track faculty member employed on a credit hour basis is the ratio of the number of 
credits allocated during the applicable base period to the full
-
time credit basis applicable for that 
base period.  [An FTE fraction of .9 
or greater is considered full
-
time, while an FTE fraction less 
than .9 is considered part
-
time.  [A nontenure

track faculty member employed as temporary and 
averaging an FTE of .
67
 
per college or more over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to 
be 
considered for a regular nontenure
-
track appointment after appropriate advertising.  [If not 
converted to regular appointment, the employee's FTE must average less than 
.67
 
per college 
during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years
.
 
 
A temporary fa
culty member averaging 
less than .
67
 
FTE per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for renewals of 
temporary appointments after appropriate reviews and approvals. 
Temporary appointments require 
an appointment end date on the hiring form
 
no later than 1 calendar year after the hiring date.
  [
All 
temporary appointments are limited to 1 year at a time.  [If there is no break in ser

Qualifications
 
 
A.
 
General Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus)
:  [Common el
ements to be considered in 
appointment, differing only in degree in all ranks, are as follows:
 
 
1.
 
Teaching
:  [This element is difficult to define precisely, but is commonly considered to include 
the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of developmen
t in the field; skill in arousing 
interest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to 
understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to 
human problems; skills in integr
ating domestic and international knowledge and insights into 
class content; and skill in raising students' awareness about the domestic and international 
social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their courses of study.
 
 
2.
 
Research:
  [
This e
lement is composed, in part, of the person's research or other creative work 
that indicates professional merit and interest.  [The results of this activity will find expression 
normally through accepted channels or media in the respective professional field
s or in the 
person's teaching.  [Teaching and research are ordinarily closely related; it is difficult to 
comprehend how a person can teach well without having firsthand understanding of how the 
knowledge of the field is discovered.  [The research performanc
e of faculty will be based on 
domestic and/or international scholarly activity.  [Annual performance evaluation of any 
faculty member will recognize that success in research may require long
-
term efforts.  [
Promotion and tenure and annual performance raises 
will give equivalent consideration to 
research effort and success, whether domestic or international. 
 
 
3.
 
Ser
vice
:
  [
This element includes the person's general contributions to the organization and 
development of the 
university,
 
and ser
vice
s to any local, 
state, national, or international 
agency or institution needing the specific benefits to be derived from the person's professional 
knowledge and skills.
 
 
B.
 
Specific Qualifications for Appointment (Main Campus)
:  [In the following statements of required 
tim
e in each rank, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PERIODS STATED ARE TO 
BE CONSIDERED AS MINIMUM AND NOT AS MAXIM
UM, UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be 
taken into consideration.  [It i
s also recognized that the evidence of competence differs for various 
fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform.

a.
 
Instructor:  [This rank should be given to persons with advanced training who have 
demonstrated scholarly/creative ability.  [Usually, the individual will not yet have 
demonstrated ability to do both teaching and research independently.  [An inst
ructor must 
have knowledge of the particular course materials and should have some intellectual 
vision; but need not be expected to have acquired a significant understanding and original 
point of view or philosophy of the general subject.  [In addition to s
uch general 
considerations, as stated above, the specific degree requirements for this rank will 
normally be the master's degree or the equivalent, and except under unusual 
circumstances the instructor will be encouraged to be studying toward a terminal de
gree.

Assistant Professor:  [To
 
be considered for this rank, a person must have demonstrated

research, and that a good teacher or researcher must constantly remol
d the materials of 
the courses or projects in the light of new knowledge derived from the person's own 
creative scholarship as well as that of others.  [An assistant professor may be expected to 
have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment 
of the general field of 
the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole.  [In addition to such general 
considerations as stated above, specific degree requirements for advancement or 
promotion to the rank of assistant professor and, of course, a
pplicable to the senior ranks 
as well, NORMALLY will be the doctor's degree.  [Outstanding experience and 
recognition in the profession outside the academic field may be considered as the 
equivalent of the degree requirement.
 
 
2.
 
SENIOR RANKS
.  [
Appointment or 
promotion to either senior rank should represent an 
implicit prediction on the part of the department, college, and the 
university
 
that the 
individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the 
remainder of the individua

investigation of the candidate's promise in scholarship, teaching, research, leadership, and 
learning. By this statement it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the 
ca
ndidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the 
extent to which past performance in teaching and creative work may be expected to carry on 
through continuing and enlarged contributions. Ser
vice
s rendered to commu
nities and 
agencies or organizations in the person's professional capacity shall be considered in assessing 
qualifications for advancement to senior ranks.
 
 
a.
 
Associate Professor:  [This person's views contribute to departmental policy.  [An associate 
professo
r should have competence and mature outlook over a fairly large part of the 
whole field.  [To be considered for this rank a person should expect to serve for at least 4 
years as an assistant professor under normal circumstances.  [A candidate for an associat
e 
professorship is expected to have demonstrated capacities in the lower ranks and should 
offer evidence that teaching and research have kept abreast of times in method and 
subject matter; that a greater degree of maturity has been attained and that there 
has been 
a retention of interest in competent teaching and research.  [Furthermore, the candidate 
must have shown evidence of productivity and competent scholarship beyond that 
completed for the degree of the doctorate.
 
b.
 
Professor:  [Appointment
 
of individual
s to professorships is obviously the most critical 
step in determining the future of the academic caliber of the 
university.
  [
There should, 
therefore, be clear understanding of the functions and qualifications of individuals in this 
rank.  [A professor thro
ugh teaching, creative activity, and ser
vice
 
should have 
demonstrated substantial command of the whole field, sound scholarship, and a mature 
view of the discipline.  [Appointment or promotion to professor should not be considered 
to be forthcoming merely b
ecause of years of ser
vice
 
to the 
university
 
(it should not be 
expected based on any number of years as an associate professor) or because a 
continuous contract is achieved.  [Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is 
expected to have maintai
ned all of the qualities and conditions required for tenure and the 
associate professor rank.  [In addition, a professor should exhibit special stature in the 
discipline, leadership and substantial strength in all areas
-
teaching, creative activity, and 
prof

.  [In the recommending procedures the department head and the 
faculty member shall submit information as follows:

A.
 
Purpose
:  [
Faculty members perform a wide variety of tasks determined by the requirements of 
their discipline and by the mission of the
 
university.
 
Accordingly their workload will vary from 
individual to individual and over time for a particular individual. The purpose of the Faculty 
Workload Policy is to establish a fair and equitable allocation of workload among faculty taking 
into acco
unt the interests of the faculty and the needs of the 
university.
 
Recognizing the complex 
role played by faculty in the 
university
 
setting, the primary responsibility for establishing 
workloads shall rest with the departments or equivalent administrative u
nit
. 
 
 
B.
 
Scope of Application
:  [
The rules set out here apply to faculty time financed from instruction and 
general (I
 
&
 
G) funds. Faculty time not financed by I
 
&
 
G funds is not covered by these rules. 
Faculty time partially funded from I
 
&
 
G shall be prorat
ed
.
 
 
C.
 
Teaching Load, Generally, for NMSU LC Faculty
:  [
A faculty member employed on the Las 
Cruces (Main) Campus budgeted exclusively from I&G funds will normally be responsible for the 
equivalent of teaching 12 credits per semester.  [The faculty member may 
be expected to 
participate in some scholarly and creative activity, professional and/or public ser
vice
, or internal 
ser
vice
 
to the 
university.
 

for formal instruction. 
 
 
D.
 
Teaching Load
, Generally, for Community College Faculty
:  [
The teaching load for community 
college faculty members will usually be the equivalent of 15 credits a semester or from 27 to 30 
credits an academic year 
The teaching load shall be prorated for short courses or 
courses taught 
over part of a semesters.
 
 
 
E.
 
Equitable Distribution of Workload
:  [
 
 
1.
 
Executive Administration:  [
The 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
and 
president
 
shall seek 
to allocate faculty resources among departments or equivalent administrative unit
s, taking 
account of internal and external constraints, so as to distribute workload in a fair and equitable 
manner. Factors that may be considered in allocating resources include accreditation, 
workloads at peer institutions, national disciplinary norms, 
and retention
 
of faculty, the needs 
of new programs, credit hour production, legislative mandates, and other factors. 
 
 
2.
 
Dean or Equivalent: 
Within each college or equivalent unit, the college dean or equivalent 
administrator shall seek to allocate faculty 
resources within their college or equivalent unit in 
order to achieve a fair and equitable workload. When inequitable workloads arise, it shall be 
the responsibility of the dean or equivalent administrator to rectify the inequality. 
 
 
F.
 
Departmental Workload
 
Policy
:  [
 
 
1.
 
Departments and equivalent units will specify how they determine teaching loads.  [
Departmental or equivalent unit workload policy will be 1) developed by the department 
faculty in collaboration with the department head and approved by the dean 
or equivalent 
administrator, 2) contained in written departmental guidelines, and 3) distributed to all faculty 
in the department. Department guidelines shall clearly specify the method by which teaching 
load is distributed. The dean or equivalent may ask 
for revisions to the departmental workload 
policy.
 
 
2.
 
In determining teaching load, the departmental or equivalent unit workload policy shall 
consider the impact of: courses with a lab component; career path of the instructor; tenure and 
promotion; workloads
 
at peer institutions; national disciplinary norms; faculty retention; 

or doctoral dissertations; student advising and retention activity; mentoring activity,

ven the 
importance of graduate programs to the mission of the 
university,
 
special consideration must 
be given to support of graduate programs. Other factors specific to particular departments or 
disciplines may also be considered.
 
 
G.
 
Annual 
Determination of 
Individual Faculty Teaching Load
/Right to Appeal
:  [
The teaching load 
for each faculty member will be determined annually by the department head or equivalent 
administrator through a process that follows established departmental or equivalent unit policy an
d 
involves an element of negotiation. The agreed upon teaching load for each faculty member will 
be articulated in writing and signed by the faculty member and the department head or equivalent 

ersonnel folder. If agreement on 
these responsibilities cannot be reached, the faculty member may appeal the case in accordance 
with 
university
 
procedures. (
See
 
Policy 4.05.50, Faculty Grievance Review and Re
solution
) In an 
appeal situation, if a change in academic responsibilities will affect the faculty member for more 
than one semester, the appeals procedure must have been completed before the reassignment can 
be made or continued.
 
 
H.
 
Considerations for Vari
ance
:  [
The percentage breakdown of time allocated to each academic 
activity may vary among faculty members.  [
 
 
1.
 
The allocation will be based on the average time required for the satisfactory performance of 
the activity.
 
 
2.
 
Courses such as thesis, dissertation
, research, special problems and independent study are not 
automatically considered to be the equivalent with teaching typical graduate or undergraduate 
courses.  [When such activities are included in the teaching load, the department head or 
equivalent adm
inistrator and the affected faculty member shall collaboratively determine 
course equivalency consistent with the department teaching load policy. 
 
 
3.
 
In collaboration with faculty in their department or equivalent unit, and subject to approval by 
the colleg
e dean or equivalent administrator, department head or equivalent administrator may 
make adjustments to faculty teaching loads if those adjustments increase load equity and are 
at least revenue neutral.  [Adjustments to teaching loads within programs should
 
result in or 
maintain load equity, should respect the career paths of faculty, and should not place an extra 
teaching burden on junior faculty who are preparing for tenure review. When a faculty 
member is assigned special duties above the normal load, arr
angements will be negotiated 
between the faculty member and concerned administrators to determine the amount of 
additional compensation, if any, to be received.
 
 
4.
 
When considering individuals for tenure, promotion in rank, merit pay increases, 
research/ser
v
ice
 
awards, and/or endowed chairs/professorships, departmental workload policy 


activities, and ser
vice
 
must be considered in the review process. 
 
 
I.
 
Cooperation
:  [
The successful application of these guidelines depends upon maintaining goodwill 
between faculty and administrators.

  [
Faculty may be compensated for teaching distance education in one of two ways, 
Differential Compensation and/or Supplemental Compensation.
  [
 
 
1.
 
Differential Compensation
:  [
 
 
a.
 
Differential compensation involves compen
sation for preparation of new distance 
education courses/programs and is determined by each college.  [
 
b.
 
This compensation may also be made available to faculty to maintain existing courses or 
programs.
 
c.
 
Faculty members may also receive differential compensat
ion for teaching a distance 
education course.  [Differential compensation for teaching distance education courses may 
be provided as reassigned teaching time, release from other responsibilities, additional 
salary, 
g
raduate 
a
ssistance support, full or part
-
time support personnel, stipends for 
contractors/vendors, etc.  [
 
d.
 
The form of compensation is at the discretion of the college administrator after 
consultation with the faculty member.  [
 
e.
 
Differential compensation may also be provided for faculty members who
 
travel to an 
off
-
campus site to teach distance education courses in addition to approved 
university
 
travel compensation.
 
f.

niversity
 
travel compensation as an addition to differential compensation is to be based 
on the distance traveled to teach the course
 
and the number of trips made in any given 
semester for the expressed purpose of teaching the course or advising students in a course 
or program.
 
 
2.
 
Supplemental Compensation
:  [
Faculty members who teach a distance education course as an 
overload may receive 
supplemental compensation as presented in 
S
ection 
4.70
 
or negotiated 
with the appropriate college dean.
 
 
a.
 
Any contract course is expected to be self
-
supporting including fringe benefits.  [Faculty 
compensation f
or contract courses must follow appropriate 
university
 
policy.
 
b.
 
Instructors who travel to remote sites shall be compensated for their travel at the mileage 
and per diem rates determined through 
university
 
travel policy.

Procedures
/Right to Appeal
:  [
 
 
1.
 
The faculty member shall submit a written notification of consulting to the facu
lty member's 
immediate supervisor (usually the department head) prior to initiation of consulting.  [At times, 
consulting opportunities arise when it is not possible to immediately submit a written 
notification (such as weekends or holidays).  [In those case
s, the faculty member is expected to 
make every possible effort to submit the notification on the next regular business day for the 
university.
 
 
2.
 
The immediate supervisor is responsible for notifying the appropriate dean or director of those 
faculty members
 
who have submitted notification of consulting.
 
 
3.
 
The faculty member shall obtain prior written permission for consulting time from the faculty 
member's immediate supervisor and appropriate dean or director.  [The request for consulting 
time must be acted up
on within 5 working days.
 
 
4.
 
Prior written approval and financial arrangements for reimbursement must be obtained from 
the immediate supervisor before 
university
 
facilities, equipment, personnel or supplies may be 
used in consulting by the faculty member.  [T
hese arrangements will be reviewed by the 
appropriate dean or director and may be disapproved, with cause.
 
 
5.
 
Causes for denial of consulting privileges include, but are not limited to:  [a clear conflict

A.
 
Department Head Increment
: It is the policy of the 
university
 
to provide additional stipends for 
those administering the academic departments, based upon the number of full
-
time faculty, part
-
time faculty, and graduate assistants supported from i
nstruction and general funds.  [It is 
understood that this increment is included in the original offer to department heads just joining the 
faculty and is relinquished if the individual gives up the department head responsibilities.
 
 
B.
 
Faculty Rank
:  [Depar
tment heads are academic administrators, with faculty rank, but eligible for 
consideration under all policies applying to the faculty.  [For example, some department heads have 
been promoted to a higher rank and some have been tenured, but obviously the pro
motion and 
tenure considerations were in keeping with their positio
ns as members of the faculty.

Leaves
 
 
A.
 
Annual Leave
:  [Department heads are treated the same as all other 12
-
month employees, except 
for those provisions pertaining to teaching responsibilities.  [For example, regular full
-
time 
employees, including department 
heads, are granted 22 working days annual leave a year 
beginning with the date of employment.  [Unused annual leave may be accumulated but shall not 
exceed more than 30 working days.  [However, all department heads are urged to take annual leave 
each year be
cause it is felt that administrators need this time off to ensure their continued 
effectiveness. A change in assignment of a 12
-
month person to less than annual regular 
employment within the 
university
 
will result in payment of any unused leave up to 30 da
ys.  [Also, 
a department head 
that
 
terminates or retires from the 
university
 
will be paid for unused leave up to 
30 working days. Accurate annual leave records for department heads must be maintained in the 
deans' offices. 
 
 
B.
 
Sick Leave
:  [Under the 12
-
mon
th plan for department heads, the sick leave policy is observed.  [
Regular full
-
time employees are granted 12 working days of sick leave a year which may be 
accumulated up to 800 hours per year.  [ A department head returning to a 9
-
month faculty contract 
is
 
not eligible for unused sick leave, but comes under the sick leave policies for the faculty.  [
Accurate sick leave records must be maintained in the deans' offices.  [
 
 
C.
 
Annual/Sick Leave for Acting Department Heads
:  [Nine
-
month faculty who serve temporar
ily in 
exempt 
positions such as acting department head should be changed by Personnel Action Form 
from faculty to 
exempt staff
 
for the period.  [Consequently, they will earn sick leave and annual 
leave at the regular 12
-
month rate, or at 9/12, 10/12, or 11/
12 adjusted rates as applicable during 
the time of administrative ser
vice
.  [If the faculty member returns to 9
-
month faculty status 
afterward, another Personnel Action Form should change 
the
 
status again from 
exempt staff
 
to 
faculty.
 
 
D.
 
Sabbatical Leave
: 
 
Sabbatical leave for department heads is determined by a formula prorating the 
time they have been on 9
-
 
and 12
-
month contracts during the previous 6 years counted towards the 
sabbatical leave.
 
 
E.
 
Summer Sabbatical Leave
:  [A department head gains eligibi
lity for sabbatical leave as indicated in 
the sabbatical leave section(s) of this manual, and may elect to take such leave in segments.  [Each 
leave segment should be of sufficient length to permit a significant planned accomplishment.  [
When segments are us
ed, the accrual for the next sabbatical leave begins with the end of the year 
in which the first segment was taken.  [The entire sabbatical leave will be charged to the 
departmental salary budget.

To prove a fact by clear

Administrative Leave
:
  [
When a faculty member is reasonably suspected or otherwise accused of 
serious misconduct constituting just cause under this policy, the faculty member may be placed on 
paid ad
ministrative leave pending a confidential investigation, in accordance with the following 
protocol:  [
 
 
1.
 
These decisions will be made on a case by case basis by the department head or equivalent 
supervisor, in conjunction with the Office of H

investigation, but not about the factual details.  [
 
 
3.
 
In lieu of paid administrative leave, 
a faculty member may be temporarily relocated to an 
alternate work environment or be assigned to perform alternate job duties, provided such 
temporary job modification will not in any way impede the investigation.  [
 
 
4.
 
A faculty member placed on paid adminis
trative leave shall remain available for 
communications from NMSU, and otherwise be ready to report to work upon request.  [If the 
faculty member has a need to be absent during a period of administrative leave, the faculty 
member shall obtain the appropriat
e approval.  [
 
 
H.
 
Confidential Investigation
:
  [
The allegations, and any defense raised by the faculty member in 
response to the allegations, shall be investigated fully and fairly, within a reasonable amount of 
time, and as confidentially as possible; based u
pon the circumstances involved in each matter.
 
 
1.
 
The investigative administrator shall consult with the assistant vice president of human 
resources or designee and/or the university general counsel for guidance and support relating 
to the performance of the
 
internal investigation.  [
 
 
2.
 
The faculty member accused shall be provided notice of the charges at the appropriate time 
during the investigation, which may be when the investigation begins, or may be later, 
depending upon the nature of the allegations.  [The
 
faculty member shall be given an 
opportunity to respond to the charges during the investigation process.  [
 
 
3.
 
The investigation shall be documented with factual findings and supporting evidence.  [The 
evidence may consist of witness statements or summaries, 
documents, audio or video 
recordings or photographs, or other exhibits.  [The investigative report, including supporting 
documentation or other evidence, shall be delivered to the

As soon as practicable, the charged faculty member shall be informed generally regarding the 
results of the inv
estigation. 
 
 
6.
 
If the faculty member is exonerated by the investigation, then no documentation referencing 
the investigation shall remain in the official personnel file, unless requested by the faculty 
member.  [ 
 
 
7.
 
If corrective action is going to be pursued
, the faculty member will be provided a copy of the 
investigative report and access to the supporting documents at the time that the corrective 
action is formally proposed.
 
 
 
8.
 
In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good f
aith, report 
reasonably suspected misconduct, the university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken 
against the reporter or any person who cooperates in the investigative process.  [A complaint 
of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the init
iation of a separate internal investigation 
to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if 
substantiated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment.  [
 
 
9.
 
If the investigative re
port reflects that the alleged misconduct was not substantiated, the 
university will make efforts to restore the reputation of the faculty member, to the extent 
feasible and desired by the faculty member. Additionally, and depending upon the 
circumstances,
 
the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the 
investigative report indicates that the initial report of suspected misconduct or any testimony 
given as part of the internal investigation may have been intentionally falsifie
d.  [If deliberate 
falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for 
disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment.  [

Just 
C
ause
, capable of being pr

subsection K.3,
 
is required before suspension without pay, reduction in salary, or involuntary 
dismissal may be imposed.  [Just cause includes dishonest behavior, gross or habitual neglect of 
professional responsib

willful violation of NMSU policy, use of any improper influence to 
secure a promotion or privileges for individual advantage or any other serious misconduct causing 
or creating the potential for harm to person, property or the institution.  [

J.
 
Administrative or Corrective Action
:
  [
Corrective or other administrative action may be taken for 

the applicable standard of proof
 
through th
e investigative fact finding process.  [  [ 
 
 
 
1.
 
The types of administrative action anticipated by this policy include one or more of the 
following:  [written warning, mandatory attendance at training, suspension without pay, 
reduction in salary, and involuntar
y dismissal.
 
 
2.
 
The range of corrective action which may be imposed for misconduct is not intended to 
require progressive discipline; rather, it is intended to allow the severity of the corrective 
action to match the seriousness of the policy violation or mi
sconduct.  [The corrective action, 
if any, to be imposed will vary depending upon the severity of the misconduct substantiated 
by the investigative findings.  [
 
 
3.
 
The investigative administrator and the 
a
ssistant 
v

shal
l coordinate regarding the appropriate level of corrective action or other administrative 
action, and if it does not warrant suspension without pay, reduction in pay, or involuntary 
dismissal, shall decide whether other corrective or administrative action 
is appropriate.  [

General Description of Due Process
:
 
A recommendation to dismiss from employment or to reduce 

property rights, which is why just cause an
d due process are required before such action may be 
taken.  [
 
 
1.
 
Due process requires fair and timely hearing processes, before an impartial hearing official or 
body.  [The faculty member charged with misconduct and facing serious disciplinary action is 
entit
led to a pre
-
determination hearing, at which the relevant facts are presented by the 
parties, and determined by a hearing officer to be accurate prior to proceeding with the 
proposed corrective action.  [This ensures that the faculty member has had an adequ
ate 
opportunity to present a defense to the claims and the evidence; it also ensures that the 
decision makers have an accurate understanding of the facts underlying the recommendation.  [
 
 
2.
 
The faculty member also has the right to a post
-
determination appeal
 
to the executive vice 
president and provost, as well as the right to request a final review by the university president.  [
 
 
3.
 
At the pre
-
determination hearing and any subsequent appeal, the burden of proving just cause
 
by the applicable standard of proof
 
is
 
on NMSU.  [
The standard of proof shall be clear and 
convincing evidence for all infractions, except for disciplinary action proposed for 
discrimination proscribed by federal and state law, which matters are investigated by the 

utional Equity; the burden of proof when discrimination 
constitutes the grounds for which the disciplinary action is being taken shall be preponderance 
of the evidence.  [
(See subsections D.4. and D.5.)
 
 
 
L.
 
Time Deadlines and Extensions:
  [
The pre
-
determinatio
n, appeal and final review processes will be 
conducted as expeditiously as possible.
 
 
1.
 
At the request from a party, a one
-
time extension of the time deadline may be granted, after 

 
to the request.  [
 
 
2.
 
If the request for the time extension is from a hearing Faculty Appeals Board member, the 
chair of Faculty Senate may grant a reasonable extension, with notice to all parties. 
 
 
3.
 
A second or subsequent request for time extension from any
 
party or from a Faculty Appeals 
Board member will only be granted in exceptional cases, after consideration of the basis for 
the request and the respective positions of the parties.  [The Faculty Appeals Board or Faculty 
Senate chair may deny a request for
 
extension, in the best interest of the institution, even if no 
party opposes it.

Policy Statement
:  [
The performance of each faculty member will be reviewed at least once a year 
by the department head, comparable administrator, or a committee. This review will include a 
writt
en report submitted by the faculty member.  [The form(s) of this report shall be determined by 
individual colleges (
community colleges
) in consultation with their departments.  [The department 
head or comparable administrator shall report the results of this
 
review to the individual being 
reviewed.  [These results shall serve to establish the goals for the following year.  [A written copy 
of the evaluation shall be given to the faculty member. 
 
 
B.
 
Procedures for the Faculty Performance Evaluation System
: 
 
 
1.
 
 
Each 
college uses its own performance evaluation form.  [Early in each fall semester the 
department head or comparable administrator supplies each faculty member with a form.  [At 
this time the department head confers
 
with new faculty members concerning the recor
ding of 
objectives and goals and the general use of the form.  [In the case of continuing faculty 
members, the department head or faculty may request a conference for the purpose of revising 
or updating objectives previously agreed upon.  [Department heads w
ill share the above 
agreements in writing with the faculty member.
 
 
2.
 
 
Department heads are expected to meet with all new and returning faculty members regarding 
progress toward promotion and tenure and to certify in writing to the appropriate dean that 
thes
e meetings have occurred.  [Specific evaluative comments in each of the three areas of 
performance are required, as well as separate comments about progress toward tenure and 
toward promotion.
 
 
3.
 
 
Each faculty member completes a written form detailing and cit
ing accomplishments in the 
broad categories of teaching, research and/or creative scholarship, and ser
vice
 
during the 
performance evaluation period.  [The type, method of collection, and disposition of evidence 
regarding effectiveness of teaching is of part
icular importance, and faculty should consult

with department heads concerning collection of this evidence.  [The performance evaluation 
form, along with any supplemental material, is submitted by each faculty member to 
the
 

department head.
 
 
4.
 
The department head reviews the faculty performance forms, prepares a written evaluation 
based upon accomplishments reported as compared with previously set goals and objectives 
(a copy of this report will be shared with the faculty member), and confers 
with appropriate 
deans to achieve consensus on the written recommendation and the prepared summary to be 
discussed with the faculty member.  [Following the conference with the dean, the department 
head meets with the faculty member to discuss all aspects of
 
the performance evaluation, 
addressing separately the person

s progress toward promotion, progress toward tenure, 
strengths, and weaknesses.  [This conference also serves to set goals and objectives for the 
ensuing year.  [No mention shall be made at this c
onference of the recommendation in terms of 
dollars.  [These goals and objectives will be placed in writing, with a copy to the faculty 
member.
 
 
5.
 
 
At 
community colleges
 
with program coordinators, the coordinator performs the duties of a 
department head in th
e evaluation process.  [The coordinator will confer with the community 
college
 
executive
 
officer, who in turn confers with the

6.
 
 
Department heads formulate recommendations where appropriate regarding promotion and 
tenu
re on the basis of policies stated in this manual.  [These are communicated to the college 
dean.
 
 
7.
 
 
Each college generates its own time schedule for accomplishing the above items, within the 
parameters of the 
university
 
calendar.

Tenure Review Policy ensures that all tenured faculty members will receive an annual review 
and that those with either exceptionally fine performance or serious deficiencies in one or more areas 
will be identified. Special achievemen
t shall be rewarded in a manner determined by each college or 
community college campus.  [For a tenured faculty member who receives two successive unsatisfactory 
annual reviews with identified and uncorrected serious deficiencies, this policy provides a mec
hanism 
to establish a remedial program for correcting the deficiencies.  [The legislation to which this policy 
responds is particularly concerned with the quality of teaching, and that fact shall be considered when 
taking any action under this policy.  [In p

The f
aculty member may request that the superior submit the record of poor performance and 
suggested actions to the other tenured faculty members of the unit for consideration in a more 
complete review, or
 
 
2.
 
If the faculty member does not request the review, the
 
superior may initiate such a review 
with the concurrence of a majority of the tenured faculty in the academic unit.

Introduction 
 
 
A.
 
Promotion and tenure decisions are the means by which NMSU rewards and retains its most 
valued scholars, sustains excellence in its instructional discip
lines, and fulfills its mission to 
advance knowledge.  [The quality of faculty accomplishments in teaching and advising (or its 
equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and ser
vice
 
largely determines 
the quality of the 
university
 
as a whole.  [The granting of tenure or promotion to associate or full 
professor represents a prediction by the 
university
 
that the individual concerned will continue to 
make substantial contributions to the profession and the 
university.
 
 
B.
 
The processes inv
olved in promotion and tenure rely upon basic principles in order to be effective.  [
Above all, the promotion and tenure processes must be fair, transparent, and participatory.  [These 
values mean that decisions must be made without regard to race, national 
origin, gender, gender 
identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special 
friendships, or animus towards candidates, taking care to avoid conflicts of interest, structural, 
institutional, or habitual thought
s and patterns that could lead to discrimination.  [NMSU values the 
richness that inquiry based upon intellectual and cultural differences brings to the 
university
 
community.
 
 
C.
 
Each principal unit must develop written standards by the end of the Spring Semes
ter of 2008 
based on criteria developed by that principal unit subject to the approval of the dean or equivalent 
administrator.  [Criteria and procedures must be clear and readily available to all participants and

must be followed by all participants at eac
h level of the process.  [Therefore, it is imperative that 
clear standards for annual performance evaluation, promotion, and tenure be articulated and 
broadly publicized.  [Applicants for tenure or promotion must be judged on their performance of 
the duties 
assigned to them, following agreed
-
upon allocations of effort.  [The process needs to 
involve broad consultation by groups and individuals with successively broader views of the 
mission of the 
university,
 
and provide the opportunity for appeal.  [In order to
 
achieve fairness, 
transparency, and broad
-
based participation, all of the parties must base decisions on the 
documentation called for by this policy.
 
 
D.
 
This policy relies on the four types of scholarship defined by Ernest L. Boyer (1990) in his book 


1
, namely, the scholarships of discovery, of teaching, of integration, 
and of engagement.  [Broadening the definition of scholarship 
(

ection

) reflects the 
changing roles of faculty member
s in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity,

Guiding Principles
 
 
The following guiding principles are critical underpinnings to the promotion and tenure process at 
NMSU.
 
 
5.90.3.1
 
Faculty Participation
 
 
The selection and retention of facult
y members are of utmost importance to the quality of the 
university,
 
the achievement of 
university
 
goals, and the future of the institution.  [In order to ensure a 
fair process for recognition of excellent faculty, it shall be the policy of the 
university
 
t
o allow faculty 
members to vote on the promotion or tenure of departmental colleagues, exercising collegial judgment 
based on an established set of criteria.
 
 
5.90.3.2
 
Transparency of Process
 
 
A.
 
Access to Promotion and Tenure Policies/University Posting
: 
 
For faculty members to trust the 
promotion and tenure process, they need to have a clear idea of what is expected of them, how 
they will be evaluated, and the rules of the process.  [To this end, the 
university
 
website will 
include a specific link to the 
u
niversity
 
-
wide promotion and tenure policy, professional ethics 
related to promotion and tenure, the appeals process, and links to college
,
 
department, or division 
policy statements.
  [
 
 
B.
 
Departmental and Principal Unit Postings
:  [
 
 
1.
 
To promote the transp
arency of the process, each principal unit shall post on its website its 
written policy document aligned with the Guiding Principles, Criteria, and Policies outlined in 
this policy. 
 
 
 
 
2.
 
Websites will also contain links to the 

 
promotion and ten
ure documents, as well 
as to each of the department websites.
 
 
3.
 
In addition, each department shall post on its website its current statement of goals, 
objectives, and expectations as these relate to promotion and tenure (sometimes called a 
functions and cri
teria statement).  [These shall be agreed upon by the faculty in each 
department and approved by the responsible dean or comparable administrator.  [

Performance Evaluation
 
 
The annual performance evaluation is a component of the promotion and tenure process.  [This multi
-
layered evaluation system relies on consistency at each level of review.  [The performance of 
each 
faculty member, including college faculty, will be reviewed at least once a year.  [The performance 
evaluation provides documentation of expectations and a record of faculty performance relative to 
stated expectations
.  [
The form of the evaluation is de
termined by the college or community college and 
shall align with promotion and tenure expectations.  [

A.
 
Service to Missio
n
:  [
The amount of effort that faculty members regardless of rank or position 
devote to the various aspects of their duties necessarily varies, and any fair promotion and tenure 
process will recognize these variations.  [A successful process considers whethe
r the faculty 
member is effectively serving the mission of the 
university,
 


a faculty member made in response to admin
istrators or committees are taken into account during 
promotion and tenure evaluation and are not discredited.
 
 
B.
 
Fairness Despite Variance in Duties
:  [
One faculty member may devote more time to teaching at 
one point than at another.  [The efforts of two facu
lty members may vary at the same points in their 
careers according to their particular strengths and department needs.  [Faculty assignments in 
different departments will also vary.  [It is fundamentally unfair, for example, to expect the same 
amount of scho
larship and creative activity, ser
vice
, extension, or outreach from a faculty member 
teaching one class a semester as from another faculty member teaching three classes a semester or 
several large lecture classes.
 
 
C.
 
Equitable Treatment
:  [
In order to ensure 
equitable treatment, every faculty member will complete 
an allocation of effort statement as part of the annual evaluation process.
  [
(
See also 
Policy 5.20.20
)
 
 
When determining the allocation of effort, dec
isions must be made without regard to race, national 
origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual 
orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates.  [Further, for the allocation of effor
t 
statement to be accurate and useful, administrators at all levels must understand and take an active 
role in avoiding institutional factors that could produce an undue burden on untenured faculty 
members and those from underrepresented groups in the allo
cation of effort process.
 
 
D.
 
Use of Allocation of Effort Statement
:  [
Each college shall develop and use an allocation of effort 
statement as specified in Section 
5.90.5.1
.  [These statements shall be a part of the faculty 
m

factored into the recommendation made at each step of the process.

An assistant professor is expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some 
segment of
 
the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole.
 
4.
 
Assistant professors are tenure
-
track faculty members hired on a yearly, renewable contract 
for a maximum of seven years.  [
 
 
5.
 
During the sixth year, assistant professors typically are evaluated f
or promotion and tenure 
simultaneously, having submitted their portfolio at the beginning of that year.  [
 
 
6.
 
However, an assistant professor may elect to apply for tenure or promotion at any time with 
the written approval of department head and dean or their
 
equivalents.  [
 
 
7.
 
The application for tenure may occur only one time.
 
 
D.
 
Associate Professor
: 
 
 
 
1.
 
An associate professor is often a mid

If a faculty member is initially employed at the rank of associate 
professor without tenure, the 
probationary period may vary depending upon agreements stipulated in writing at the time of 
initial hire.  [
 
 
3.
 
Once tenured, associate professors may hold this rank indefinitely or apply for promotion.  [
 
 
4.
 
Promotion to professor 
should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years

Flexibility in Tenure
-
Track
 
 
Normally, before being considered for tenure, eligible faculty members serve six consecutive 
probationary years.  [The probationary period begins with the first year of the contract.  [Note that  [ 
according to 
Policy 5.98

-
track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in 
September (12
-
month employees) or the second Friday in October (9
-
month employees) will not 

ill be issued at the beginning of the next contract 
period, which will constitute the first year of the probationary period toward tenure.  [During the sixth 
year, a case for tenure and/or promotion is made by the faculty member and considered by the 
univer
sity.
  [
Those achieving tenure are awarded a continuous contract at the end of their sixth year, 
while those not awarded tenure are given a one
-
year terminal contract for their seventh and final year 
of employment at NMSU.  [There may be exceptions, however,
 
to shorten or lengthen the normal six

Extension of the Probationary Period
 
 
When requested in writing within one year of the q
ualifying event by the faculty member, leaves of 
absence can lead to postponement of the tenure decision date; however, modifications in that date 
require the recommendation of the department head and dean and the approval of the 
executive
 
vice
-
president
 
a
nd 
provost
.  [Faculty responsibilities may be negotiated when the extension is requested.  [An 
extension may be granted up to two times, so long as the total pre
-
tenure probationary period does not 
exceed eight years.  [Exceptions to this limit can be made un
der extraordinary circumstances if 
approved by the 
executive
 
vice
-
president
 
and 
provost
.  [Candidates must be held to the same standards 
of performance when the probationary period has been extended as candidates whose probationary 
period was not extended. 
 
The probationary period may be extended, upon written request, under the 
following circumstances:
 
 
A.
 
Leave of Absence without Pay:
  [
Probationary faculty members may request in writing a leave of 
absence without pay, usually not to exceed one academic or 
fiscal year.  [Prior to initiating the 
leave, affected faculty may request in writing a probation extension of one year.
 
 
B.
 
Military Leave of Absence:
  [
Involuntary induction into the armed forces entitles the faculty 
member to a leave of absence to cover t
he term of military ser

.  [Such leave constitutes valid 

voluntary participation in a military reserve program may lead to periodic or prolonged absence 
suffi

e.g
., annual active duty training, or active 
duty training or participation when a reserve unit is called to active duty) that constitutes valid 
grounds for extension of the tenure decision date.
 
 
C.
 
Medica
l Leave of Absence:
  [
Probationary faculty members with a serious personal illness or 
providing prolonged, substantive care for a chronically ill family member may request in writing 
an extension of the tenure decision date, usually for one year.
 
 
D.
 
Family
 
Leave of Absence or Exceptional Family Responsibilities:
  [
Upon written request, 
probationary faculty members who become parents will receive a one
-
year automatic extension of 
the tenure decision date.  [Such an extension does not require that the faculty m
ember take a leave 
of absence.
 
 
E.
 
Catastrophic Events:
  [
Probationary faculty who have experienced a catastrophic event such as a 
fire or flood or who must aid family members in such situations may request in writing an 
extension of the tenure decision dat

Joint Appointment (with Dual Primary Responsibilities)
 
 
In appropriate circumstances, a faculty member may be appointed in two departments or colleges.  [The 
faculty member with a joint appointm
ent has a memorandum of understanding from all involved units.  [
The memorandum of understanding stipulates the expected workload and allocation of effort 
distributed between the two departments; identifies the principal unit where tenure resides or will 
re
side if applicable; defines the responsibilities of the faculty member in each unit; and indicates the 
term of appointment.  [The memorandum must explain the process for performance and promotion and 
tenure reviews, renewal of the joint appointment, and sal
ary increases.  [Each unit must provide 
recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews.  [In joint appointments with 
centers or institutes, the tenure home must reside in a principal unit.  [In joint appointments with two or

Criteria for Promotion and Tenure
 
 
When considering applicants for 
promotion and tenure, serious attenti
on will be given to performances
 
in the applicable areas of teaching and advising (or its equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, 
ser

, extension and outreach
,
 
and where applicable, leadership.  [The relative 
importance of each of 
these areas varies according to the cumulative allocation of effort statements.  [Each area is vital to the 

 
ability to achieve its mission, and the performance of a faculty member will be viewed as 
an indication of future 
contributions.

advancement in r
ank.  [The teaching and advising category includes all forms of 
university
-
level 
instructional activity, as well as advising undergraduate and graduate students, both within and 
outside the 
university
 
community.  [Such activities are commonly characterized b
y the 

students to think critically and to apply knowledge to human problems; the integration and 
application of relevant domestic and international, social, politi
cal, economic, and ethical 
implications into class content; the preparation of students for careers in specific fields of study;

Forms of 
Faculty Advising
:  [
Faculty advising may take the form of assisting undergraduate or 
graduate students in the s
election of courses or careers, assisting learners in educational programs 
on and off campus, mentoring students, serving as faculty adviser to student groups, research and 
teaching advising, as well as other forms.
 
 
5.90.4.1.1
 
Evaluation of Teaching
 
 
A.
 
 
Evi
dence By Which Teaching Effectiveness is Assessed
: 
Teaching is a complex and multifaceted 
activity.  [Therefore, several forms of evidence should be used to assess comprehensively teaching 
effectiveness.  [Each form of evidence should carry a weight appropri
ate to its importance in 
evaluating teaching.
  [
Such documentation must demonstrate command of subject matter, 
continuous growth, and development in the subject field, the ability to organize material and 
convey it effectively to students, assessment of stu
dent learning, revision and updates of curricula, 
and the integration of scholarship (for faculty who produce scholarship) and ser
vice
 
with teaching.  [
Materials appropriate for evaluating teaching should include: (a) evidence from the instructor, (b) 
evide
nce from other professionals, (c) evidence from students, and (d) evidence of student 
learning.
 
 
B.
 
Principal Uni
ts To Develop 
Guidelines
: 
 
Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines for its 
teaching faculty that define teaching responsibilities and sp
ecify required evidence documenting 
teaching effectiveness.
  [
Specific data to be included in the evaluation packet will be determined by 
each principal unit.
 
 
5.90.4.1.2
 
Evaluation of Advising
 
 
For promotion and tenure considerations, performance in such a
ctivities must be documented and 
evaluated.  [Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities and 
documentation requirements for its faculty who advise.

Rationale
:  [
Scholarship and creative activity involves discovering and creating, teaching and 
dissem
inating, and applying knowledge and skills to worldly concerns.  [This understanding is 

processes, outcomes, and the passionate commitment of the professoriate a
nd others in the 
university
 
to disciplined inquiry and exploration in the development of knowledge and skills; (2) 
the scholarship of teaching involves dynamic, reciprocal, and critically reflective processes among 
teachers and learners at the 
university
 
a
nd in the community in which their activity and interaction 
enriches and transforms knowledge and skills, taught and learned; (3) the scholarship of 
engagement refers to the many and varied ways to responsibly offer and employ knowledge and 
skills to matte
rs of consequence to the 
university
 
and the community; and (4) the scholarship of 
integration is the process by which knowledge and skills are assessed, interpreted, and applied in 
new and creative ways to produce new, richer, and more comprehensive, insig
hts, understanding, 
and outcomes.

NMSU Definition of Scholarship and Creative Activity
:  [ 
Scholarship and creative activity is both 
activity and product, employing dynamically interacting processes of discovery and creation, 
teaching and dissemination, en
gagement and application, and integration, in the pursuit of 
fulfilling the mission and vision of NMSU.  [Products developed through these processes, are 
public, open to peer review, and available for use by others.  [Scholarship and creative activity can

D.
 
Use of Technology is a F
actor in Evaluation Categories
: 
The dissemination and creation of 
scholarly work using technology is becoming increasingly important.  [Accordingly, it is important 

  [
The 
rapid pace at which technology changes makes it difficult to use a single set of evaluation criteria 
to fit all cases encountered.  [Technology often crosses the rigid boundaries of teaching and 
advising, scholarship and creative activity, ser
vice
, ex
tension, and outreach, and as such, it must 
be evaluated in as many of these categories as appropriate.  [Flexibility in evaluation of the

5.90.4.3.1
 
Evaluation of Extension and Outreach
 
 
A.
 
Collaborative Effort
:  [
Extension and outreach work is collaborative by nature.  [Faculty should 
provide evidence of collaboration with whomever necessary to identify local needs, garner 
resources, discove
r and adapt new knowledge, design and deliver programs, assess clientele skill 
changes, and communicate program results.  [Collaborative effort should also include networking 
with other 
university
 
faculty in identified areas of program discovery, developmen
t, and delivery, 
including applications to teaching and advising where appropriate.  [
 
 
B.
 
Evaluation Guidelines
: 
To evaluate extension and outreach scholarship the following guidelines 
are recommended
:
 
 
1.
 
Faculty must provide evidence of extension and outreach 
scholarship in order that 
these 
[collaborative] 
efforts are recognized.  [
 
 
2.
 
The documentation should provide evidence that the work is: 
 
 
a.
 
creative and intellectual; 
 
b.
 
validated by peers; 
 
c.
 
communicated to stakeholders; and 
 
d.
 
have an impact on stakeholders and 
the region.
 
 
3.
 
Components of extension scholarship include: 
 
 
a.
 
developing programs based on locally identified needs, concerns, and/or issues; targeting 
specific audiences; 
 
b.
 
setting goals and objectives for the program; 
 
c.
 
reviewing current literature and/or re
search for the program; 
 
d.
 
planning appropriate program delivery; 
 
e.
 
documenting changes in clientele knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and/or skills; 
 
f.
 
conducting a reflective critique and/or evaluation of the program; 
 
g.
 
validation of the program by peers and/or
 
stakeholders;
 
and
 
h.
 
communication of results to stakeholders and decision makers.
 
 
5.90.4.4
 
Ser
vice
 
 
Ser
vice
 
is an essential component of the 

 
mission and 
requires that the faculty member 
contribute to the organization and development of the 
uni
versity,
 
as well as provide ser
vice
 
to any 

professional knowledge and skills.
 
 
5.90.4.4.1
 
Evaluation of Ser
vice
 
 
The type and amount of ser
vice
 
that 
a faculty member performs should be determined in consultation 
with the appropriate administrator(s).  [
All relevant activities in which a faculty member participates 
should receive appropriate consideration for promotion and tenure decisions.  [Ser
vice
 
cont
ributions 
should be evaluated based on how they are applied and how they draw upon the professional expertise 
of the faculty member.

Reassignment of Administrators/Department Heads
 
 
Due to the larger scope of responsibility of most administrative positions, the reassignment of an 
administrator with faculty rank to a faculty position normally results in a reduction
 
of salary.  [Several 
factors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of faculty salaries in the 
department where the reassignment occurs. Normally, department heads who have less than 4 
complete years return to 75 percent of 
their base salaries (not including department head increment), 
and department heads who serve 4 or more years return to 80 percent of their base salaries.  [Again, 
several factors are considered in making the salary determination, including the level of fac
ulty salaries 
in the department where the reassignment occurs.

Research Philosophy
:
  [
Research is an important component of every academic activity, and is, 
therefore, the source of content for quality instr
uctional programs.  [New Mexico State University 
recognizes research as essential to the vitality of the university and undertakes the support of 
research as part of its institutional responsibility.  [The mission statement expresses the importance 
of resear


land
-

comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, an
d public service
.  [
 
The university promotes academic inquiry and protects academic freedom for those engaged in it.  [
This includes the support of research and off
-
campus study as potentially valuable experiences for 
faculty and students.  [These experiences
 
may take the form of sabbaticals, internships, intensive 
study of specialized techniques, and conducting research at specialized facilities.  [These 
opportunities offer researchers considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable 
contacts am
ong faculty members, students, the university, industry and other research institutions.  [
 
 
B.
 
Protections in Research Involving Human Subjects
:
 
It is the policy of the university to protect the 
rights, well being, and personal privacy of individuals particip
ating in research projects, while also 
maintaining a favorable climate for the conduct of scientific inquiry and protecting the interests of 
the university. The university has established the Institutional Review Board to regulate the 
participation of huma
n subjects in research, consistent with federal law.  [(

All research conducted at or by the university, regardless of funding source, shall adhere to the 
requirements of the Institutional R
eview Board and the following tenets:  [
 
 
1.
 
The university, including its faculty, staff, contractors and student body shall be responsible 
for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects. 
 
 
2.
 
No human subject involved in a research activity shal
l be exposed to unreasonable risk to 
health or well
-

-
being.  [
 
 
3.
 
All participation by human subjects shall be voluntary; no subject will be coerced in any way 
to participate in a rese
arch project.  [A request by any subject to withdraw from a research 
activity shall be honored promptly without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled, within the limits of the research.  [
 
 
4.
 
The confidentiality of information 
received from subjects in experiments or respondents to 
questionnaires shall be protected, both during and after the conduct of a research activity, 
consistent with applicable law.  [
 
 
5.
 
In research which involves more than minimal risk, or which involves sub
stantial stress or 
discomfort, such risk, stress or discomfort shall be carefully explained in advance to the 
subject.  [The researcher(s) shall be satisfied that the explanation has been understood by the 
subject, and that the written consent of the subjec
t, is obtained and kept as a matter of record.  [
The researcher(s) shall be responsible for ensuring that method used to obtain informed 
consent (written, audio
-
recorded, witnessed) is the most appropriate for the participant, and 
for providing appropriate 
evidence of informed consent consistent with the approval granted 
by the Institutional Review Board and with applicable federal law.  [
 
 
6.
 
Research involving special subject populations (e.g., persons under the age of 18, or mentally 
disabled or disadvantaged
 
persons) may be conducted as long as a qualified guardian signs the 
consent form.  [
 
 
C.
 
Protections in Research Involving the Use of Animals
:
 
As a land grant institution, it is the 

use of animals in the 
service of man, and to advance human and animal welfare.  [Consistent with applicable law and 
regulations, the university supports the use of animals in research, education, and as agricultural 
resources, provided that the usage is rea
sonably expected to advance knowledge about human or 

applicable to animal use.  [
 
 
The university has established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Co
mmittee to administer 
policies and procedures regarding university care and use of vertebrate animals.  [(
See 
5.94.30
 
E. 
below)  [Any concerns regarding the use or care of animals by the institution should be
 
addressed 
to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  [

Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research
 
 
A.
 
Definition of Research Misconduct
:
 
Research misconduct is academic misconduct, dishonest 
behavior, or any form of unethical practices involving an act of deception whereby one's 
work or 
the work of others is misrepresented.  [Other terms, such as research fraud or scientific misconduct, 
are subsumed within the term academic misconduct.  [Research misconduct is distinguished from 
honest error and from ambiguities of interpretation th
at are inherent in the scientific process.  [The 
principal element of research misconduct is the intent to deceive others or misrepresent one's 
work.  [Research misconduct may also involve wrongful acts or omissions relating to non
-
compliance with applicable
 
law or regulation, a failure to report known misconduct or retaliation 
against others involved in the reporting, investigation or correcting misconduct.  [Research 
misconduct may take numerous forms such as, but not limited to:  [
 
 
1.
 
Falsification of Data
:
  [
F
abrication, willful suppression and/or distortion of data with the intent 
to falsify results.  [
 
 
2.
 
Plagiarism
:
  [
The use of the work of another without proper acknowledgment.  [
 
 
3.
 
Improprieties of Authorship
:
  [
Improper assignment of credit, such as excluding ot
her authors, 
inclusion of individuals as authors who have not made a definite contribution to the work 
published, or submission of multi
-
authored publications without the concurrence of all 
authors.  [
 
 
4.
 
Misappropriation of the Ideas of Others
:
  [
Unauthorized
 
use of privileged information (such as 
violation of confidentiality in peer review), however obtained.  [
 
 
5.
 
Violation of Generally Accepted Research Practices
:
  [
Deceptive practices in proposing, 
conducting, or reporting research.  [
 
 
6.
 
Material Failure to Comp
ly with Governmental Requirements
:
  [
Serious, repeated, willful 
violations of governmental requirements arising from law, statute, regulation, or agreement.  [
Regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the use of funds, care of animals, 
hum
an subjects, and biological, chemical, pharmacological, and radiological materials.  [
 
 
7.
 
Inappropriate Behavior in Relation to Research Misconduct
:
  [
Unjust and malicious 
accusation(s) of misconduct, failure to report misconduct, withholding or destruction of
 
information or evidence relevant to a claim of misconduct, or malicious retaliation against 
persons involved in the allegation or investigation of misconduct.  [
 
 
B.
 
Scope of Policy
:
  [
This policy applies throughout the university system to faculty, staff and 
students involved in research and research
-
related work regulated by federal law or sponsored 
externally.  [Such research includes, but is not limited to, research involving human subjects, 
vertebrate animals, biohazardous agents and/or recombinant DNA.  [Re
search projects involving 
the surveying of other students, university personnel, or members of the general public fall within 
the scope of this policy, unless exempted by federal law.  [Academic misconduct alleged against a 
student generally will not be cov
ered by this policy, unless it falls within the above scope, and will 
instead be addressed pursuant to the 
Academic Misconduct
 
policy housed in the 
Student 
Handbook
. 
 
 
 
C.
 
Duty to Report
:
 
Individuals wi
th a reasonable factual basis to believe that a researcher has 
committed an act of research misconduct prohibited by this policy are obligated to report such 
occurrences to a supervisor not involved in the alleged misconduct.  [Such reports of suspected 
res
earch misconduct shall be forwarded to the vice president for research for prompt investigation, 
and subsequent corrective action and reporting, if warranted by the investigative findings.  [If the 
reporter, the supervisor, or the vice president have reason
 
to suspect that a crime may have been 
committed, the report shall also be made to the NMSU Police or other appropriate law 
enforcement for a separate and distinct criminal investigation
.  [

Preliminary Internal Invest
igation
:
  [
If an appropriate oversight committee (Institutional Review 
Board, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, or 
Radiation Safety Committee) reports misconduct substantiated by an investigation with factual 
fi
ndings, this shall serve as the internal preliminary investigation.  [
 
In all other cases, the vice president for research will refer the reported matter to the appropriate 
college dean and associate dean for research, or equivalents, to conduct a prelimina
ry internal 
investigation into the alleged misconduct.  [The investigation will be conducted confidentially.  [
 
 
Within twenty (20) business days from the initial receipt of the report of potential academic 
misconduct, the evidence and any recommended findin
gs shall be forwarded to the vice president 
for research.  [During the preliminary investigation stage, the funding agency will not be notified, 
except as may be otherwise required by law or written agreement.  [
 
 
E.
 
Action on Results of Preliminary Investigati
on
:
  [
The vice president for research shall consider the 
evidence and the recommended findings of the preliminary investigation, and initiate further 
action as follows within twenty (20) business days from the date the evidence and the findings 
were receive

ounsel.  [
 
 
2.
 
If the vice president for
 
research concludes that an infraction occurred, but was not an 
unanticipated problem, did not involve serious or continuing non
-
compliance with federal 
regulations or university policy, and did not involve a suspension or termination of an 
approval grante
d by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research will 
refer the matter to the college dean or appropriate vice president for disciplinary action or 
other administrative corrective action, as warranted by the factual findings.  [
 
 
3.
 
If
 
the vice president for research concludes that the matter may involve an unanticipated 
problem, a serious or continuing non
-
compliance issue, or a suspension or termination of an 
approval granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president 
for research shall 
refer the matter for a confidential formal investigation, at which time the funding agency 
and/or the appropriate federal or state oversight agency will be notified by way of an Initial 
Report.  [The Initial Report shall indicate that eit
her follow up reports or a final report, or both, 
will be forthcoming as soon as practicable under the circumstances.  [
 
 
4.
 
If the vice president for research concludes that a crime may be implicated, the matter shall be 
immediately reported to the appropriat
e law enforcement agency for a separate and distinct 
criminal investigation.  [
 
 
F.
 
Formal Investigation
:
  [
The confidential formal investigation will be conducted by an ad hoc 
committee to be convened and chaired by the vice president for research.  [The commit
tee shall 
consist of the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research or equivalents, the 
appropriate department head, and three faculty or exempt staff members from the University 
Research Council, selected by the university research council c
hair. Substitutions, in the event of 
conflict of interest, will be made by the vice president for research or the executive vice president 
and provost, as appropriate.  [This formal investigation should be completed within two months 
from the date the commi
ttee is formed.  [The committee shall gather relevant documentation; 
interview witnesses with relevant testimony, including the person charged with the misconduct; 
preserve any physical evidence; and prepare an investigative report summarizing all evidence 
in 
the form of factual findings.  [The final draft investigative report shall be shared with the person 
charged with the misconduct, and that person shall be given a minimum of five business days to 
respond.  [

Notifications and Record Retention
:
  [
All documentation of the preliminary inquiry and formal 
investigation, if any, shall be maintained in the offi
ce of the vice president for research for at least 
three (3) years and must, upon request, be provided to authorized government personnel.  [The 
university shall comply with notification requirements imposed by funding agency regulations and 
agreements.  [
 
 
I.
 
Anti
-
Retaliation
:
 
 
In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good 
faith, report reasonably suspected academic misconduct in research, the university prohibits 
retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any 
person who cooperates in the 
investigative process.  [A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a 
separate internal investigation to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource 
Services, and if substant
iated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination of employment.  [
 
 
J.
 
False or Unfounded Complaints
:
 
If the preliminary or formal investigative report reflects that the 
complaint of academic misconduct in research was not substa
ntiated, the university will make 
efforts to restore the reputations of the researcher who was accused of having engaged in 
misconduct.  [Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a 
separate internal investigation in th
e event the investigative report indicates that the initial 
complaint or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation, may have been intentionally 
falsified.  [If deliberate falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it wi
ll be 
grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of 
employment.  [

Research Funding and Research Institutes
:
 
 
1.
 
State University Research Fund
:
  [
The State University Research Fund is the designated 
university fund where indirect (facilities and administrative) cost reco
very earned by the 
university is deposited.  [Funds to support academic research from the State University 
Research Fund are relatively scarce and must be used in a variety of ways (
e.g
., to support 
research, to stimulate new research, to support public ser
vice, and to support scholarly 
endeavors as well as the necessary administration).  [In general, it is desirable to keep the 
administrative costs at a minimum and, therefore, make available to the faculty as much 
support as possible for nonrecurring researc
h expenses.  [It is the underlying philosophy to use 
this research support in a flexible manner in keeping with college and department priorities.  [
Encouragement is given to the faculty to secure outside support for research, at the same time 
recognizing th
at it is important to provide some support to scholarly pursuits which may not 
attract outside funding.  [
 
 
 
University Research Institutes
:
  [
 
 
a.
 
University Research Institutes are units that primarily perform externally funded 
research.  [They are formed by t
he vice president for research in consultation with the 
executive vice president and provost.  [Generally, these units will report to the vice 
president for research; at the time of creating the institute, the reporting line for the unit 
shall be determined
 
by the executive vice president and provost and the vice president for 
research.  [
 
b.
 
University Research Institutes may be created by the university in anticipation of outside 
funding.  [They revert to college status or cease to exist if external funding doe
s not 
materialize.  [A University Research Institute may receive some support from the State

Resources Research Institute, University Research Institutes do not directly ret
ain a 
percentage of indirect cost recovery resulting from their activity.  [
 
c.
 
Upon the recommendation of the vice president for research with concurrence of the 
executive vice president and provost, a University Research Institute may revert to 
College Resea

Sponsored Project Proposal Process
:
 
 
1.
 
Proposal Preparation
:
  [
Proposal preparation is the responsibility of principal investigators and 
their units, working in cooperation with the Office of 
Grants and Contracts.  [The 
Proposal/Award Form or a similar automated system, as designated by the vice president for 
research, will be used by all principal investigators and project directors seeking externally 
sponsored project funding. This form will b
e processed in the early stages of proposal 
development.  [This is a mandatory form, and no research proposal will be signed or sent out 
from the university unless this form is signed by the appropriate administrative officers or 
designated representatives.
  [
Responsibility for proposal preparation includes developing 
budgets consistent with relevant cost accounting standards and obtaining appropriate 
certifications, permits (
e.g
., for drug use), and permissions 
(e.g.
, use of humans and animals in 
research).

investigator, department head, dean or director, and univ
ersity property administrator shall be 
accountable for acquisitions and dispositions of equipment and other property acquired through 
sponsored project awards.  [Any such property will be recorded on the university's inventory at a 
minimum, for property to 
which the university does not acquire title, until the expiration of the 
award period.  [A determination as to whether title to property acquired under sponsored awards 
vests with the sponsor or with the university at the end of the award period should be i
ncluded in 
the award agreement, rather than negotiated at award termination.  [The university property 
administrator will be kept informed of any amendment to the initial determination regarding 

updated and the necessary final 
property reports prepared.

Tenure Home
:  [
Tenure at the 
university
 
is placed in a specific department/program/community 
college where the criteria for 
each individual's tenure are established.  [
Tenure at the community 
college
 
means at the community college, not on the main campus.  [There is no obligation to bring 
the person to the main campus if 

 
position ceases to 
exist at the community coll
ege.

B.
 
Initial Appointment
:  [
Excerpts from this manual regarding promotion and tenure will be presented 
to each new member of the faculty* prior to appointment and 

acceptance of 
an appointment indicates understanding and acceptance of
 
the provisions of the contract as 
specified in this manual.  [Information regarding social security, retirement, hospitalization, 
disability, and life insurance will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to 
appointment and acceptance
 
of the conditions of employment.  [The patent policy for the 
university
 
staff will be presented to each prospective member of the faculty prior to appointment, and 
acceptance of the appointment indicates understanding and acceptance of this policy.

at a time) for personnel with or without previous experience agreed upon from 
other institutions of higher education will ordinarily not exceed 6 years.  [At the discretion of the 
administration, the trial period may be shortened.  [Thereafter, there shall 
be a presumption of 
permanence in employment and the requirement of cause as indicated below assigned for 
dismissal.

continuous appointment is made in 
writing according to the following schedule: 
 
 
a.
 
for faculty members in thei
r first year of ser

at this 
university
 

 
3 months or more 
before the end date of their contract; 
 
b.
 
for faculty members in their second year of ser

at the 
time of nonrenewal 

 
1 year or more before the end date of their contract. 
 
 
A Contract Status Form must be processed by the department head for the nonrenewal of a 
temporary contract prior to 
the deadlines established for notification. The employee should 
acknowledge receipt of such notification by dating, signing, and returning the Contract Status 
Form. 
 
 
F.
 
Voluntary Termination of a Temporary Contract
:  [Any staff member who proposes to resign s
hall 
give written notice to the administration at the earliest time possible, but in no case later than 30 
days after the staff member receives written notification of the terms of the next year's contract, or 
3 months prior to the start of the following a
cademic year, whichever is later, except when 
mutually agreed upon by the individual and the administration.  [The faculty member should 
inform the department head in writing.  [The department head will inform the dean, who in turn 
will notify the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.  [The department head should then submit a 
terminating Personnel Action Form at the earliest possible date.  [If death is the reason for 
termination, payment will be made for all unused annual leave accrued at the time of death to
 
a 
maximum of 52 working days of leave.  [If a person listed by the promotion and tenure committee 
does not wish to be considered for promotion or tenure, the person must so indicate to the 
department head in writing.  [
However, if the person is in the fifth
 
year of tenure
-
track ser
vice
, 
withdrawal from consideration for tenure must be accompanied by written notice of resignation 
effective at the end of the sixth year of ser
vice
 
(this notice to be received by the department head 
before the end of the fifth ye
ar of ser

Change to Continuous Contract
:  [The department head initiates the Contract Status Form to 
accomplis
h the change from temporary to continuous contract.  [All recommendations for tenure 
must be accompanied by notification to the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
 
from the dean of 
the result of the faculty committee vote.  [When tenure is awarded, it is aw
arded in the unit that 
initiated the request for tenure (continuous contract).  [No temporary appointment can become 
continuous without the official action of the 
university
 
administration.
 
 
I.
 
Continuous Contracts
: A continuous appointment is not a matter of 
right, but is made after the 
provisional period has been completed successfully, providing the individual's ser
vice
s are needed.  [
Such an appointment is made by the issuance of a new contract at the time of continuous

appointment or shortly thereafter, and
 
the contract becomes the abiding instrument governing 
employment, except that the terms may be modified from time to time by endorsement.  [
Continuous contracts are issued by the Office of the 
E
xecutive
 
V
ice
 
Pr
esident
 
and 
P
rovost
 
following receipt of an ap
proved Contract Status Form.  [Continuous contracts are not reissued 
until there is a promotion in rank.  [Each spring an official contract amendment (salary letter) is 
issued by the 
president

 
office which informs the faculty member of final performance ev
aluation 
and annual salary for the ensuing year.  [Once a faculty member has been appointed to a continuous 
contract, that faculty member will retain continuous contract status even though the faculty 
member accepts appointment at less than full time.
 
 
J.
 
Tran
sfers
:  [Normally there are four types of transfers of faculty members within various agencies 
of the 
university
:
 
 
 
1.
 
A faculty member leaving an instructional/research department to serve in a different 
instructional/research department.  [Under these circ
umstances, the individual may be given 
credit toward a continuous contract for the years served in the earlier department.  [With 
proper departmental and college vote, and the completion of a Contract Status Form by the 
new department, tenure may be transfe
rred with a faculty member from one department to 
another.
 
 
2.
 
The transfer of a faculty member from a non
-
instructional division to an instructional division 
or 
vice
 
versa.  [Under these circumstances, years of ser
vice
 
in the prior position will not 
necess
arily count toward a continuous contract in the new position.  [Proven performance in 
the first position, under these circumstances, might not assure that the individual would be 
able to render satisfactory professional ser
vice
 
in the new area of assignment
.
 
 
3.
 
The transfer of a faculty member from the 
university
 
community college campuses to an 
instructional division on the main campus or 
vice
 
versa.  [Under these circumstances, years of 
ser
vice
 
in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a cont
inuous contract in the new 
position or assure appointment in an equivalent rank.  [Proven performance in the community 
college or main campus position might not assure that the individual meets the rank 
requirements of the new position.

The transfer of 
a faculty member from one community college to another
:
  [
Under these 
circumstances, the individual may be given credit towards a continuous contract and rank for 
the years in the previous community college.

A.
 
Definition of Academic Unit
:  [
For 
the purpose of this policy an academic unit is defined as a 
college, a department, an undergraduate major, a graduate degree program, or a library, whether 
these units are located on the main or a 
community college
.  [
 
 
B.
 
Reviews/Recommendations and Approvals
 
Required
:  [
Any proposal to create, reorganize, relocate 
or eliminate an academic unit must be submitted for review and recommendation by the Faculty 
Senate, the Academic Deans Council, and the 
president
 
to the 
Board of Regents
 
for their 
consideration and 
action. 
 
 
C.
 
Initiation of Proposal to Create, Reorganize, Relocate or Eliminate an Academic Unit
:  [
Proposals 
to create, reorganize, relocate, or eliminate an academic unit formally originate with a bill 
submitted to the Faculty Senate.  [The proposed legislat
ion shall follow the procedure specified in 
Faculty Senate Constitution ARTICLE IX Propositions for Consideration of the Constitution of 
the Faculty Senate, except that no such proposal will be considered as emergency legislation.  [
 
 
D.
 
Effective Date
 
of Chan
ge
:  [
If approved, the creation of a department will be effective either 
January
 
1 or July
 
1 following the approval.
 
 
E.
 
Procedure for Implementation
:  [
After approvals from the appropriate authorizing bodies are 
obtained (
i.e
., Faculty Senate, Academic Deans C
ouncil, etc.), the requesting department 
head/director must submit an Organization Change Request Form to the Office of Human 
Resource Ser
vice
s for processing.  [The form must be submitted with all relevant documentation 
attached no later than November 30 (
for January 1 effective date) and May 31 (for July 1 effective 
date).
 
 
F.
 
Creation of New Colleges
:  [The creation of a new college is a decision based on the weighing of a 
number of criteria, including those below.  [An attitude of flexibility, reality, and or
ganizational 
feasibility should be maintained in applying these criteria.  [The structure of the entire 
university,
 
if 
a new college is formed, is an important consideration. 
 
 
1.
 
There should be a documented professional need for the college in the state a
nd region.
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:  [This can be expressed through increasing student enrollment in programs that 
would be part of the new college, or an obvious need for professional graduates of the 
college as expressed by state and local groups who desire to hire
 
these professions. 
 
 
2.
 
The proposed college should be of a recognized profession or group of disciplines.
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:
  [
The new college should give a desirable added professional recognition and 
development in the area of the new college.
 
 
3.
 
At the ou
tset, the new college shall have a minimum student enrollment of 250 with 
demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 500 within a 3
-
 
to 5
-
year period and a 
sufficient number of faculty to make it a viable administrative unit within the 
university.
  [
 
 
a
.
 
Rationale:
  [
After several development years, the quantity of faculty and students should 
be sufficient to lend themselves to a quality of organization, instruction, and ser
vice
 
that 
will provide a viable thrust to the 
university.
 
 
 
 
The quality and quant
ity of the faculty in the proposed college should be capable of 
maintaining with distinction an academic undergraduate and graduate program.

The 
university
 
must be willing to make the commitment to furnish financial support for an 
additional
 
college. 
 
 
 
a.
 
Rationale
:
  [
This should include an adequate budget to provide for an expanding staff at 
the college level and funds for additional housing at a professional level.  [
 
 
G.
 
Changing a Department or Group of Departments into a School
:  [The proposed school shou
ld 
incorporate more than one area of specialization or should offer more than one degree (may 
include interdisciplinary cooperative efforts or more than one department).  [The proposed school 
should be an administrative and support unit with undergraduates 
and graduate students and an 
established, nationally recognized teaching and research program.  [The administrative head of a 

equal to that of a department h
ead.  [The legislation must contain a clearly stated and convincing 
justification for the name change, and must have support of the department and college faculty and 
administration.
 
 
H.
 
New Academic Unit
:  [There should be a documented academic/educational nee
d for the academic 
unit, including but not limited to, an increasing student enrollment or significant employment 
opportunities for graduates in that field.  [The new program(s) should be consistent with the 
mission of the 
university
 
and the college in whic
h it will be located.  [There are sufficient faculty 
and resources to staff the program.
 
 
I.
 
Relocation or Reorganizing an Academic Unit
:  [Proposals to relocate a department must meet all 
of the following criteria:
 
 
1.
 
The relocation will produce a more homogenou
s set of programs and departments in both 
colleges.
 
 
2.
 
The relocation will enhance the professional identity of the
 
program or department involved
 
 
3.
 
The relocation will not cause undue hardship for other academic units.
 
 
4.
 
The faculty and administrators directl
y affected are in agreement.
 
 
5.
 
Such a change will better serve the 
university
 
community, clients, and/or the mission of the 
university.
 
 
6.
 
Address the transfer of resources, courses taught, and the faculty rank and tenure (or years to 
tenure) of those individ
uals being transferred.
 
 
7.
 
If a unit is being relocated to another college, there should be significant support from the unit 
being transferred and the unit receiving the transferred personnel/resources.
 
 
J.
 
Elimination of an Academic Unit
:  [(
See
 
also
 
Policy 4.40, Layoff/Financial Exigency
) Proposals to 
eliminate an academic unit must meet the following criteria:
 
 
1.
 
A significant decline in enrollment, either as measured by number of majors or student credit 
hours.
 
 
2.
 
The reso
urces are needed by programs or departments with much higher enrollment or student 
credit hour production.
 
 
3.
 

teaching, research, and ser
vice
 
shall be considered.
 
 
K.
 
Undergraduate Program Changes
:  [(
See
 
Curricula
 
Changes
) All undergraduate program changes, 
including those of associate degrees, will be reported by the appropriate college representative at 
the fall curriculum me
eting of the Associate Deans Academic Council.  [If applicable, adequate 
library resources and support ser
vice
s should be confirmed.

Articulation Agreements
 
 
A.
 
The decision
 
to participate in an articulation agreement with another institution(s) rests with the 
faculty.  [
 
 
B.
 
For those articulation agreements that are initiated by the New Mexico Higher Education 
Department, the administration will appoint a representative to the 
HED Statewide Articulation 
Task Force.  [The representative will consult closely with faculty in individual departments on 
discipline
-
specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements.  [Department 
faculty must approve any changes wh
ich affect how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to 
implementation.  [Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in 
the Course Transfer Matrix established by the 
Office of the 
Registrar.  [(
See
 
Transfer Credit in 
Undergraduate Catalog
)  [
 
 
C.
 
In cases where a change in the current HED Articulation Agreement will affect the 

 
general education requirements, the representative will consult closely with the General Edu
cation 
Committee prior to signing any articulation agreements.  [The General Education Committee must 
approve any changes affecting the structure of the 

 
general education curriculum prior 
to its implementation.  [
 
 
D.
 
For those articulation agreeme
nts initiated by a 
university
 
department or college, the initiating 
department or college will consult closely with the faculty in individual departments on discipline
-
specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements.  [Department 
faculty

The 
Board of Regents
 
endorses the concept of articulation between 2 and 4
-
year colleges and 
universities.  [At the 
university,
 

ranscripts has been done by 
one central office for over 15 years.  [By centrally evaluating these transcripts, the majority of the 
problems with respect to articulation have been resolved.  [In addition, the 
university
 
has prepared 
academic transfer guides f
or all two
-
year institutions in the state of New Mexico.  [To promote the 
continuous efficient, forward progress of students through the educational system of New Mexico, 
the 
board
 
endorses practices and matrices which facilitate the intrastate transfer of 
credit and 
support the development and implementation of a statewide articulation plan.  [To this end, 
students awarded the Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree from an accredited New 
Mexico postsecondary institution will be accepted at the juni
or level*
 
in baccalaureate degree
-
granting institutions.
 
 
*Students will be allowed to register as juniors.  [They may be required to take lower division course 
work to fulfill specific baccalaureate degree requirements.  [This interpretation will be publish
ed in 
catalogs and student transfer guides.

Authorized Absences
 
 
Students
 
making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are 
representing the 
university
 
at
 
a

sponsored event (
e.g
., ASNMSU 
president
 
re
presents the 
university
 
at legislative session, student

athletes competing in 
university
 
scheduled athletic events, or 
educational field trips, and conferences).  [Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class 
responsibilities.  [Prior written noti
ce of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the 
sponsoring department.

Curricula Changes
 
 
A.
 
All new courses, course changes (descript
ion, credit, prerequisite, etc.), and course deletions are 
approved by the Associate Deans Academic Council, prior to being placed in the catalog or in the 
Schedule of Classes.  [This includes courses offered at the community colleges that meet for less 
tha
n a full semester.  [A special meeting is called when appropriate to consider interim courses and 
other course changes approved for review by the chair of the Associate Deans Academic Council.  [
Deadlines for having this information to appropriate offices wi
ll be announced and enforced.  [The 
chair is empowered to act for the committee on a one
-
time
-
only basis in the case of extenuating 
circumstanc
es.
 
 
B.
 
Although a grade of D is "passing" but "below
-
average" work, it is recognized that in some 
courses
,
 
and seque
nces of courses highly cumulative in nature, below
-
average work is not 
adequate preparation for the subsequent courses.  [In such cases the Associate Deans Academic 
Council may approve a prerequisite specifying "a grade of C or better in the prerequisite co
urse."
 
 
C.
 
A 
department wishing to initiate a new course, delete a present course, or introduce changes in 
descriptions, credits, or prerequisites must submit the request to the cognizant dean on the NCR 
form designed for this purpose.  [(These forms, commonly
 
called "flimsies," are available in the 
deans' offices.)  [Format guidelines for flimsies are also available in the deans' offices.
 
 
D.
 
Summary sheets, in alpha
-
numeric order by prefix, provide a cover list of changes.  [(For example, 
a number change  [BIOL 116
 
to BIOL 119; a title change  [CHEM 199, Intro. to CHEM to 
Elementary Chem; a credit hour change  [PE101, 1 cr to 2 cr; a  [prereq. Change E T 101 to E T 
112; a course deletion GEOG 206; or a new course.)  [Copies of summary sheets and flimsies are

departments by the deans.  [An approved copy of the NCR form is distributed to the scheduling 
office, cognizant dean, and the cognizant department head.  [Courses which have not been offered 
for 
5
 
years are subject to automatic deletion by the scheduling office.  [Before initiating deletion, 
the scheduling director prepares a list of such courses, an
d departments may request that they be 
maintained if suitable justification exists.

Course Material/Textbooks
 
 
A.
 
Course Material
:  [Department heads are responsible for having on file a course outline for each 
course offered by the department.  [Each
 
professor is responsible for course content and selection 
of required materials (textbook(s), supplementary printed material, equipment, supplies) for the 
course.  [The professor is obligated to keep course costs to the student as low as possible.  [The 
dep
artment head is responsible for the approval of bookstore requests, requests for supplementary 
materials, and for the coordination of requirements for multiple sections.  [The department head 
should be cognizant of course costs to students and advise the pr
ofessors should such costs appear 
to be excessive.  [
 
 
B.
 
Textbooks
:  [All textbook orders from faculty must be channeled through the department head for 
signature and approval and then forwarded to the bookstore manager.  [The bookstore manager will 
review d
epartmental requests for textbooks and order as per the department head's request.  [Order 
quantities may be increased or decreased by the bookstore manager if previous enrollment or sales 
history indicates that it is necessary.  [Department heads must notif
y the bookstore manager 
immediately when additional sections are opened or courses canceled.  [Faculty will not be allowed 
to order and/or sell books on or off campus without written approval from the appropriate dean 
and the bookstore manager.  [Before a fa
culty member may require students to buy a textbook or 
other material authored or coauthored by that faculty member, approval from the department head 
is required.  [The department head may convene a committee of department faculty to consider the 
matter.  [
If the department head is the author/coauthor of the required textbook or other material, a 
committee
 
of department faculty will consider the matter and make a recommendation to the dean, 
whose approval will be required.  [Supplementary materials, published
 
or unpublished, produced 
by departments or individuals for sale to students will be sold through the 
university
 
Bookstore or 
through 
 
other vendors who are authorized to purchase such materials from departments only, not 
from individual faculty members.  [
Payment by the vendors shall be made to the department upon 
receipt of an appropriate departmental voucher or invoice.  [Faculty and staff members may request 
reimbursement from their departments for their expenses.

misconduct review panel consisting of th
e department head of the appropriate department, or 
if appropriate, Graduate Council chair, the chair of the Faculty Senate, and an administrative 
officer of the unit in which the suspected misconduct occurred.  [No one who has participated 
in any previous 
decisions relating to the facts underlying the allegations in question may 
participate on the Review Panel (or on the ad hoc committee, described below).  [In the event 
of a conflict of interest, alleged bias against the accused or refusal to serve on the p
anel, the 
dean shall appoint a replacement from the senior faculty.  [This panel shall review the 
evidence and its evaluation, decide whether a formal charge is appropriate, and advise the 
dean and the 
executive
 
vice
 
president
 
and 
provost
.

detail, upon which such charge(s) are based.  [This notice will also inform 
the accused of the 
right to appear at a hearing before an ad hoc committee and to present evidence at that 
hearing.  [The notice shall inform the accused of the proposed date of the hearing and that, if 
the allegations are substantiated, the revocation of t
he accused's degree will be considered as a 
sanction.  [In addition, a copy of these procedures shall be included with the notice.  [This 
notice shall be delivered to the accused in person or by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested.

Majors and Minors
 
 
A.
 
Majors
:  [New majors, including those of associate degrees, are endorsed by the Academic Deans 
Council, 
and then
 
approved by the Faculty Senate and the 
Board of Regents
.  [
A major is defined 
as a recognized area of study in which there is an extensive and well
-
developed curriculum offered 
at the 
university,
 
as well as adequate library resources and support ser
vice
s.  [A major may include 
courses from more than one department,
 
but as a minimum it must consist of at least 24 credits in 
the major field, of which 18 credits must be upper
-
division courses.  [A student may take a double 
major.  [In this case, 
the student
 
must meet all of the requirements in the catalog for each degree
.  [
Courses taken outside of the two major fields may be used to fulfill the conditions of both degrees.
 
 
B.
 
S
upplementary Majors
:  [In addition to a major, a student may elect to undertake a supplementary 
major.  [The academic colleges offer supplementary ma
jors in areas where sufficient numbers of 
courses of a closely
-
related nature are available so as to constitute a significant body of study.  [The 
minimum requirements for a supplementary major are 24 credits taken from the catalog listing for 
the field of 
study, of which 18 credits must be upper
-
division courses.
 
 
C.
 
Minors
:  [A student may also minor in a particular area.  [A minor is based on courses that 
encompass a recognized field of study.  [As a minimum, a minor must consist of 18 credits of 
course work
, of which 9 credits are at the upper
-
division level.  [Upon approval of the dean of the

Summer teaching at the 
university
 
is considered a privilege and not a right.  [Departments will use the 
 
following guidelines in determining summer teaching assignments within the department's FTE 
 
summer allocation:
 
 
A.
 
 
Priorities
:  [1) 
The first priorit
y must be student and program needs
. 
 
As resources permit, courses 
needed by the students to complete programs in a timely fashion should be offered
.  [2) 
After 
student needs, continuing tenured and tenure
-
track faculty will have priority in teaching 
assign
ments.
 
 
B.
 
 
Development of Departmental Policy
:  [
Departments will have the flexibility to develop their own 
policies after priorities #1 and #2 above have been met.  [The departmental policy must be written 
and available to all departmental faculty and other i
nterested parties.
  [
 
The departmental policy 
must adhere to existing policies related to summer teaching (
e.g
., current policy states that, in 
general, faculty members will be employed in one 6
-
week period only).

Faculty Teaching
-
Normal
:  [Because the summer schedule must be prepared well in advance, and 
summer funding is always uncertain, early agreements regarding summer teaching must be 
identified as tentative.  [
No actual commitment 
is made until approvals are completed on an

rofessional leave 
without pay, normally not to exceed 1 year, for the purpose of undertaking some project that will 
directly benefit the 
university
 
and the person's professional development. These benefits must be 
detailed in the application. 
 
 
B.

Leaves 
-
 
Sabbatical
 
 
A.
 
Purpose
:  [The purpose of a sabbatical leave is to promote pro
fessional growth and increased 
competence among faculty members by subsidizing significant study and research, creative work, 
or some other program which is judged to be of equivalent value and which cannot be 
accomplished during the fulfillment of normal 
academic duties and responsibilities.  [All 
departments and colleges including 
community colleges
 
are encouraged to participate fully in the 
sabbatical program.
 
 
B.
 
Qualifications and Options
:  [Application for sabbatical leave may be made by any tenured ful
l
-
time faculty member (above the rank of instructor) with at least 12 regular semesters of full
-
time 
ser
vice
 
at the 
university
 
without a sabbatical.  [A faculty member who is in the last year of the 
probationary period may be considered for sabbatical leave
 
if a favorable decision on tenure has 
already been made.  [ Sabbatical leave may be taken in conjunction with earned annual leave, 
personal leave, or educational leave without pay.  [Personal leave and educational leave without 
pay must comply with 
universi
ty
 
policies. In instances where, for good and sufficient institutional 
reasons, a sabbatical leave is delayed (not to exceed 2 years), the faculty member will become 
eligible for a succeeding sabbatical leave after an equivalently reduced period.  [A facult
y member 
should be given as much notice as possible if a sabbatical leave cannot be approved for the time 
frame requested. Sabbatical leave is available under the following options: 
 
 
1.
 
One semester at no reduction in annual salary.
 
 
2.
 
One full cont
ract year a
t 60 percent salary 
(Those within 5 years of retirement should consult 
the Employee Benefits Office about the possible negative impact on the retirement benefit 
formula.)
 
 
3.
 
Semester II (spring) of 1 year and Semester I (fall) of the following year, at 30 pe
rcent annual 
salary for each semester of leave.
 
 
 
When a person has served as both a 9
-
month and 12
-
month employee in the 6
-
year period 
immediately prior to the requested sabbatical, the amount of time allotted for the sabbatical will be 
prorated.  [A facul
ty member employed on a continuing basis on a 12
-
month contract may take a 6
-
month leave at full salary or a 12
-
month leave at 60 percent salary.
 
 
C.
 
Applications
:  [Sabbatical leave will not be granted automatically upon the expiration of the 
necessary per
iod of ser
vice
.  [Rather, a qualified faculty member shall, normally at least 6 months 
in advance of the leave, submit an application and proposed leave program to the department head 
or chair, with evidence of research, creative activity, or other academic
 
achievement, including 
publications, to support the program of work which is planned for the sabbatical period.  [Also, this 
program shall give reasonable promise of accomplishing the major purpose of the leave.  [Request 
for a sabbatical leave should be ac
companied by a detailed explanation of the benefits to the 
faculty member, 
university,
 
and the state resulting from the sabbatical leave.  [For main campus 
faculty, the approval of the cognizant dean, graduate dean and 
provost
 
are required.  [For 
community c
olleges
, the approval of the division dean, CAO and CEO are required.  [In addition to 
the work plan, the leave application should include:  [(1) a statement regarding choice of options; 
(2) departmental verification that during the applicant's absence, teac
hing, research, and ser
vice
 
duties can be managed by the department; (3) a statement concerning compensation to be received 
during the leave.  [A faculty member on sabbatical leave at full pay usually will not take other paid 
employment during the leave; an
d (4) a clear statement of the benefit of the proposed leave to the 
university.
  [
A person on sabbatical at 60 percent time usually will not take more than 40 percent 
time employment.  [However, it is recognized that such employment may be necessary for or 
e
nhance the leave.  [In such cases, a request to take compensated employment should be included 
in the proposal submitted and must have administrative approval. The evaluation of an application 
should be based on whether the planned program satisfies the aim
s and goals explicitly set forth in 
the Purpose statement above.  [These aims and goals may be independent of geographical location 
of the leave activities and, therefore, the place of the faculty member's residence during leave 
should be only one factor in
 
considering the merits of the application.  [ However, to ensure that

faculty member, the sabbatical period will normally include a component of study/work away 
fro

D.
 
Related Conditions
:  [Time toward each new sabbatical begins immediately after return to full
-
time 
ser
vice
 
regardless of the semester of return.  [The sabbatical leave will not adversely affect salary 
increases or promotions.  [I
nstitutional participation in faculty retirement and group insurance will 
be continued for staff on sabbatical leave with pay.  [A faculty member on sabbatical leave may 
request, through the department head, travel support for participation in professional 
meetings.  [
Consideration will be given if the faculty member is an officer of the professional organization or 
is to participate in some other significant way.  [Educational or other leaves are excluded as time 
counted toward eligibility for sabbatical leav
e. Twelve
-
month faculty will accrue annual and sick 
leave (at 60 percent for those on 60 percent pay) and will report annual and sick leave as usual. 
 
 
E.
 
Departmental Implementation
:  [Long
-
range department plans should consider the necessity of, and 
provi
de for, temporary absences for sabbatical leave.  [The initial leave discussions and 
concomitant management of duties is primarily a matter for discussion and approval by the 
concerned department.  [However, in transmitting the final leave request to the dea
n and 
provost
, 
the department head should provide assurance that all student needs will be served by the 
department during the faculty member's absence.  [In some departments, the absence of one faculty 
member might place an undue load on the other departme
nt members.  [After a department has 
taken every step possible to plan for sabbatical leaves, it should submit its proposal to the dean for 
consideration.  [The administration will attempt to accommodate these special cases.  [
 
 
F.
 
Procedures
:
 
 
1.
 
At least 6 mon
ths prior to the requested leave period (exceptions to be considered on a case
-
by

section.
 
 
2.
 
Preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department head, cognizant dean, 
dean of the
 
Graduate School, and the 
provost
 
are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. 
 
For 
community college 
faculty, preliminary approval is obtained wh
en signatures of the 
department chair, division dean, CAO and CEO are affixed to the Request for Leave Form.  [A 
supplementary
 
contract, stipulating that the faculty member is obligated and agrees to return 
to the 
university
 
to
 
serve a period of 1 year, and
 
failure to do so would require immediate full 
refund of all salary paid by the 
university
 
during the leave, is prepared and sent to the facult
y 
member.  [Upon receipt of the s
igned supplementary contract, final approval of the leave is 
granted and the facu

notified.
 
 
3.
 
Department heads or chairs submit a Personnel Action Form to place the faculty member on
 
sabbatical.
 
 
G.
 
Post
 
S
abbatical Obligations
:  [Sabbatical leaves will be approved only with the clear understanding 
that at the completion of t
he sabbatical and/or supplemental leave, the faculty member will return 
to the 
university
 
for a period of ser
vice
 
of 1 year.  [Failure to do so will require immediate full 
refund of all salaries and benefits costs paid by the 
university
 
during the sabbatica
l, and repayment 
for any annual leave accrued and used during the extended leave.  [Within the first semester upon 
return from the sabbatical, the main campus faculty member shall submit to the 
provost
, through 
the department head and dean a full report of 
the research, creative work, publications, or other 
results of the period of leave.  [This final report should contain a brief summary of the proposal, 
including a review of the objectives, as well as a summary of what was accomplished.  [An 
explanation shou
ld be given in the event that some objective(s) were not met.  [This report will be 
incorporated in the faculty member

s annual written report and may be used in the annual 
performance evaluation process.  [The dean will forward the report
 
with both the dean

Sick Leave Bank
 
 
A.
 
This program establishes a Sick Leave Bank to be used by 
participating 
university
 
employees 
affected by a personal emergency, and who have insufficient leave to cover required work 
absences.  [
 
 
B.
 
A personal emergency is defined as an unusual and catastrophic medical or immediate family 
medical emergency that is li
kely to require an employee's absence from duty for a prolonged 
period of time and to result in a substantial loss of income because of the unavailability of paid 
leave.  [
 
 
C.
 
Only those items allowable under the 
university
 
Sick Leave Policy are covered by th
e Sick Leave 
Bank; maternity leave in connection with an uncomplicated pregnancy is not a personal 
emergency.  [
 
 
D.
 
The bank allows employees to share the risk of severe circumstances by donating to a common 
pool of leave.  [
 
 
E.
 
Members of the pool are required 
to enroll in the long
-
term disability insurance long
-
term 
disability program as a protection against income loss while recovering from a severe medical 
condition.  [The long
-
term disability policy covers total disability after a waiting period of 135 
consec
utive calendar days or 100 work days.  [
 
 
F.
 
The maximum a recipient can receive from the Sick Leave Bank is 70 days per personal 
emergency with no more than one withdrawal from the bank per fiscal year or per personal 
emergency.  [No more than 70 days can be w
ithdrawn for a particular medical condition.  [
 
 
G.
 
Employees would be wise to maintain a balance of at least 30 days of combined sick and annual 
leave to cover them during the first 30 days of personal emergency or total disability.  [The Sick 
Leave Bank does 
not provide for the first 30 days of the personal emergency; these are the 
responsibility of the employee and are covered by the employee's sick and annual leave or leave 
without pay.  [
 
 
H.
 
Program requirements and application procedures are maintained on the
 
web pages for the

Procedural Guidance
:  [
 
 
1.
 
Management should attempt to schedule staff and faculty such that excessive 
overtime and hardship to the employee 
is avoided; the hardship differential pay 
addresses those situations where this cannot be avoided.  [
 
 
2.
 
Extraordinary working conditions include situations when the employee is required 
to work an inordinate number of hours beyond the normal forty (40) hour 
work 
week, or to work under unusually risky and/or hazardous conditions, or to work 
away from home through a holiday.  [Such working conditions should not be the 
norm, and payment of extra compensation is justified due to the significant hardship 
placed on 
the employee during the period of time necessary to meet the work 
objective.  [
 
 
3.
 
In order to receive hardship differential pay, the appropriate dean, 
vice
 
president
 
or 
designee and the 
Office of Human Resource Services
 
must approve it in writing. 
 
 
4.
 
The amou
nt of the hardship differential pay will be a differential over and above the 

 
 
a.
 
Hardship differential pay will be included in the calculation of overtime 
compensation for 
non
exempt empl
oyees.

The differential for exempt and faculty employees shall not exceed their 
regular base rate of pay.

A.
 
Employees Exempt from Overtime
:  [Any individual employed in a bona fide 
executive
, 
administrative, or 
exempt 
capacity, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, may be 
exempted from compensatory time o
r payment of overtime.  [Employees so exempted 
shall be termed exempt.  [All other categories will be termed nonexempt.  [
Exempt/nonexempt status will be determined by a review of the specific description of 
duties for the position in question.  [Positions hav
ing like classifications may receive 
different exempt/nonexempt classifications based on the specific duties and 
responsibilities required.  [The 
Office of Human Resource Services
 
may be contacted for 
information regarding exempt/nonexempt status on any pos
ition.
 
 
B.
 
Overtime Administration
:  [A director/department head may prescribe reasonable periods 
of overtime work to meet the needs of an operation.  [A nonexempt employee may only 
work more than 40 hours a week after having obtained prior approval or instr
uctions 
from the appropriate supervisor.  [Complete records of overtime for employees will be 
maintained in each department or office.
 
 
C.
 
Overtime Payment
:  [Nonexempt employees as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(
See 
Chapter 4 Human Resources 
-
 
General 
-
 
Hiring Definitions
)
 
are eligible to be 
compensated or given compensatory time for overtime.  [
Upon election by the employee, 
overtime work may be compensated in the form of overtime pay or compensatory time 
off.
  [
Normally, employees who are eligible for payment of overtime will not work in 
excess of a 40
-
hour week.  [To prevent a backlog, workloads should be adjusted by 
determining needs sufficiently in advance so that temporary help may be hired.  [
The 
university
 
has no contractual obligation to pay overtime or approve compensatory time.
  [
If it becomes necessary for nonexempt employees to work more than 40 hours in a 
week, the following will apply:

C.
 
Holi
day Pay
:  [Any nonexempt employee required to work on one of the official holidays 
and who does not receive a day off in lieu of the holiday, may be compensated at one 
and a half times the regular hourly rate in addition to the holiday pay regardless of the
 
number of hours actually worked during the normal work week.  [If compensatory time, 
in lieu of payment, is granted for work performed on a holiday, it shall be granted at the 
rate of one and one half times the number of hours worked regardless of the numb
er of 
hours actually worked during the normal work week.  [An employee whose normal work 
schedule does not include a day designated as an official 
university
 
holiday may receive 
a day off in lieu of the holiday during the same work week in which the holiday
 
falls.  [
Payment for a holiday, annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, compensatory 
time, or compassionate leave will be considered as hours worked only during a work 
week in which an official 
university
 
holiday occurs.  [Otherwise, in order to be 
paid at 
the overtime rate, actual hours worked must be in excess of 40 hours for an employee's 
work week.  [If holiday hours and actual hours worked exceed 40 hours in a workweek, 
calculation of overtime hours will exclude holiday premium hours already comp
ensated.
 
 
D.
 
Overtime Reporting
:  [Nonexempt employees eligible for payment of overtime who are 
required to work in excess of 40 hours per week will report overtime hours worked on 
the

Compensation Overtime Report at the end of the pay period.  [The 
method 
for computing overtime is stated on the form. 
 
 
E.
 
Compensatory Time
 
(Comp Time)
: The purpose of compensatory time is to provide an 
alternative to cash payment of overtime.  [A nonexempt employee may only work more 
than 40 hours a week after having obta
ined prior approval or instructions from the 
appropriate supervisor.  [
 
 
1.
 
Upon election by the employee, overtime work may be compensated in the form of 
compensatory time off. When such form of compensation is elected, the employee 
shall be paid for all hour
s worked in excess of forty (40) hours during the work 

and earn comp time at an additional .5 times the overtime hours worked. The 
university
 
shall designate two (2) opportuni

1.
 
 
2.
 
The date to be taken as comp time off shall be scheduled by agreement between the 
supervisor and the employee. Supervisory appr

Wayfinding and Signage Policy
 
[
New po
licy adopted by Administrative Council 11.14.06; 
ratified by Board of Regents 07.20.10] 
[Amendment recommende
d by Administrative Council 
07.27.11; approved by Board of Regents 08.22.11]
 
 
A.
 
Purpose
:  [
To establish parameters for a unified graphic design to be used on all signage at 

 
to 
students and visitors as they navigate the campus. 
 
 
B.
 
Policy Administrator
:  [
This policy is administered by 
Facilities and Services
. 
 
 
C.
 
Rationale
 
and Objectives
:  [
 
 
1.
 
T
he goals of the NMSU Wayfinding and Signage Program are to implement a cohesive 
graphic 
identity throughout the entire Las Cruces campus by 
Facilities and Services
. The look 
and style of the signs applied uniformly and accurately will create a positive first impression 
by displaying graphics that will assist students and first
-
time visitors w
ith navigating the 
campus and by providing them with a sense of welcome, security and comfort. 
 
 
2.
 
This document establishes parameters and provides guidelines that will maintain a unified 
look for all signage on campus. Collaboration and participation by in
terested parties 
(administrative staff, architects, sign designers, interior designers, campus project managers, 
etc) will ensure that the system remains uniform and cohesive. The design of the signage will 
incorporate the guidelines from the branding init
iative. 
 
 
3.
 
The Wayfinding and Signage Program is all encompassing. It includes directional signs from 
roadways, to parking, to pedestrian activities, to buildings and ultimately to final destinations. 
The guidelines serve the entire Las Cruces campus and wi
ll be applied to new construction as 
well as modifications to existing buildings.
 
 
4.
 
Roadway signage will emphasize the main campus entrances and clearly identify visitor 
information destinations. Parking lots will be clearly marked, and campus maps and 
dire
ctories will be strategically placed at pedestrian entry paths adjacent to parking lots. 
 
 
D.
 
Required Architectural Signage
:  [
Campus buildings will have architectural signage as follows: 
 
 
1.
 
Building Identification/dimensional letters 
-
 
with the official name 
of the building as 
approved by the Board of Regents placed near the main entrance(s). Address numerals may 
also be utilized (numerals only). All letters on buildings will be a standard size as noted in the 
signage guidelines. 
 
 
2.
 
Building Identification/free
standing sign 
-
 
with name of building, one name per building, as 
defined by the Naming Committee, placed near the main entrance or near the primary 
walkway to the main entrance in instances when the front door is obscured or when there is no 
appropriate lo
cation on the architecture for dimensional letters. One line of descriptive text 
may also be applied to the sign when needed or feasible, as defined by the Naming 
Committee. Address, with numerals and street name only, may also be applied to the sign 
panel
. Signs may be single sided when parallel to the building or double faced when 

NMSU Policy Manual

perpendicular to approaching traffic. 
 
 
3.
 
Building Directories/wall mounted 
-
 
Tenants and sub
-
tenants of buildings will be listed on 
building directories as shown in the signage g
uidelines. 
Facilities and Services
 
will provide 
information and assist building managers with implementing the directory signage through the 
NMSU Sign Shop. Directories are recommended in lobbies of buildings at primary entrances 
on the first floor or grou
nd level. Secondary directories, such as floor directories and/or 
elevator lobby directories, can provide further opportunity to guide visitors and provide tenant 
information.
 
 
4.
 
All appeals pursuant to this policy should be directed through the university a
rchitect to the 
Campus Planning Committee.

password and remain private, unknown 
to all others.
 
Integrity
 


 
Legitimate use of a

Although some rules are built into the system itself, these restrictions cannot limit completely what I can 
do and can see. In any event, I am responsible for my actions whe
ther or not rules are built in, and 
whether or not I can circumvent them. Misuse includes (but is not limited to): unauthorized access to or 

use of anoth
er individual's program(s) or file(s); and knowingly attempting to circumvent established

Information 
Security Policy
 
Manual
 
The University of Connecticut 
developed
 
information security policies to protect the availability, 
integrity, and confidentiality of University 
information technology
 
(IT)
 
resources
. W
hile t
hese policies 
apply to 
all faculty, staff, and students of the University
, they 
are primarily applicable to 
D
ata
 
Stewards
, 
those that 
manage access to data and 
IT
 
resources, and 
those
 
who use University 
IT
 
resources.
 
 
The University expects all emplo
yees, students and users to adhere to the policies herein. No set of 
policies can address all scenarios of IT security; therefore, 
these 
policies address the most common 
aspects of security. We cannot eliminate malevolent behavior or irresponsibility, but 
we can guide users 
and admin
istrators toward responsible decisions and action
s
.
 
 

The CISO works in cooperation with University employees whose responsib
ilities address information 
technology
 
and information security.
 
 
In order to protect resources from threats and ensure compliance with applicable laws and industry 
standards, the University will manage and regulate networks and other 
IT 
resources.
 
 
All 
em
ployees must 
immediately report lost or stolen technology resources to the 
University 
Police 
Department
 
(860
-
486
-
4800)
, the 
Information Security Office
 
(860
-

-
8255)
, and
 
the 
Office of the 
Controller
 
(860
-

-
2937)
.
 
 

IT 
resources, whether owned or contracted, will be configured to meet the 
requirements set forth in these policies.
 
Agreements that involve a 
third party accessing or managing 

IT 
resources shall comply with all 
of 
the requiremen
ts specified in these policies.
 
 
Owners of 
IT 
resources are responsible for keeping computer systems protected from activities that 
could compromise the 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the resources. Owners 
shall 
perform 
regular and timely 
computer m
aintenance, which includes, but is not limited to, 
installation
 
of software 
patches, and updates to malware
 
and virus
 
p
rotection. The automatic 
implementation of 
patches and 
updates at regular intervals will be utilized for all capable devices.
 
Owners of 
IT 
resources 
should
 
be 
aware of the business and availability requirements for their systems, and owners 
shall 
create 
appropriate documentation a
nd processes to meet the requirements outlined in these policies.
 
 
University 
managers 
should
 
direct 
faculty and 
staff to the information security policies and discuss the 
impacts and outcomes of the policies for their
 
specific
 
areas. 
Upon hire, employees 
will sign a 

which will be administered and maintained by the Human 
Resources 
department.
 
 
The regulations of 
The Student Code
 
remain applicable to stude
nts and their registered organizations
,
 
regarding
 
information
 
s
ecurity: 
 

personal or public property, including but not limited to records, electronic files, 
telecommunication

UCI Principles of Community
Contact
: OfÞce of Information Technology (OIT) at (949) 824-2222 or 
oit@uci.edu
The University of California, Irvine (UCI) provides computing resources and worldwide network access to

members of the UCI electronic community for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate
and to retrieve and disseminate information. All members of the UCI community (faculty, staff, students, and
authorized guests) sharing these resources also share the rights and responsibilities for their use.
A. Rights and Responsibilities
Worldwide, open access electronic communication is a privilege and continued access requires that users act
responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from violation,
destruction, theft, or other abuse. Users sharing computing resources must respect and value the rights and
privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant
laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Users are responsible for refraining from acts, intentional or
inadvertent, that obstruct the access of others to these resources, waste limited resources, harm resources or
information, or violate the rights of others.
To help protect computer and network resourcesÞles, users are responsible for setting passwords appropriately,
and for keeping passwords conÞdential by not giving them to another person, and for following other appropriate
security procedures. Personal equipment accessing the network must conform to 
Section 800-18
, Security
Guidelines for Computers and Devices Connected to UCInet. In particular, personal computers must have
current security patches applied and the appropriate security software (e.g., anti-virus protection) properly
functioning. 
Guidance on appropriate security measures
 may be obtained from OIT or an administrative
Information Security Coordinator
. Users connecting equipment to the network which threaten the security of the
network or other systems by failing to follow this guidance may have their ability to connect equipment to the
network suspended.
Most UCI owned computers are under the control of system administrators or managers, who are required to
respect the privacy of computer system users. However, they may access user Þles or suspend services on the
systems they manage without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine
accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use or of having been misused, corrupted or damaged. This
includes temporarily locking vulnerable accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource-intensive jobs, etc.
In addition to campus and UC policies such as the Electronic Communications Policy, many UCI departments
have their own computing and networking resources and policies. When accessing computing resources, users
are responsible for obeying both the policies described here and relevant departmental policies. Students are
also responsible for obeying the policies described in the 
UC Policies Applying to Campus Activities,
Organizations, and Students
. In addition, all users are responsible for obeying policies of off-campus network
services accessed using UCI resources.
B. Examples of Misuse
Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to:
Knowingly running, installing, or giving to another user, any program on any computer system or network with
the intended purpose of damaging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network used by
others. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bots, spamming, and
password cracking programs.
Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent
of the appropriate authority. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify
security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data.

Using computers, electronic mail or any other form of computer network based communication to act
abusively toward others or to provoke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of violence,
or other hostile or intimidating "Þghting words." Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize
or stigmatize individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, and other
protected characteristics.
Posting on electronic bulletin boards, Web pages, or any other computer network based dissemination
channel, any materials that violate University policy or codes of conduct.
Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communications or reading, copying, changing,
or deleting another user's Þles or software without the explicit agreement of the owner.
Violating copyright laws or restrictions.
Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements.
Using campus networks to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to any computer system.
Using a computer account or obtaining a password without appropriate authorization.
Facilitating or allowing use of a computer account, password, and/or network access or resources by any
unauthorized person.
Employing, either directly or by implication, a false identity when using an account or other electronic
resources. This includes sending unauthorized mail that appears to come from someone else as well as
posting or otherwise disseminating materials which misrepresent the identity of the sender.
Disguising, misrepresenting, or concealing the identity of a computer system connected to the network.
Performing an act without authorization that will interfere with the normal operation of computers, networks, or
peripherals, or will interfere with others' ability to make use of such resources.
Using an account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to work at UCI, such as consulting
services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commercial
enterprises for personal Þnancial gain.
Distributing, posting, or otherwise making available to those not authorized any conÞdential, sensitive, or
private information.
C. Consequences of Misuse
Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their
conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privileges
and/or Federal or State legal prosecution. Appropriate corrective action or discipline may be taken in
conformance with applicable personnel policies, student policies, collective bargaining agreements, and
procedures established by the Academic Senate. (In extreme cases, corrective action may include dismissal.)
California Penal Code, Section 502
 makes certain computer abuses a crime, (such as illegal reproduction of
software protected by U. S. copyright law) and penalties can include a Þne and/or imprisonment. Files may be
subject to search under proper authorization.
Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, use of resources in a manner which impedes
but does not totally block their use by others are typically handled internally to the department in an informal

manner. More serious infractions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to
circumvent system security, etc. are handled formally through the OfÞce of the Dean of Students or by other
appropriate ofÞcials.

other purposes. 
 
3-0601.2  [POLICY
  [4.01 User Responsibility and Expectations
  [
Within the following sections, examples of acts or omissions, though not covering every situation, 

are included to specify some of the responsibilities that accompany computer use at Oklahoma 

State University, and to outline acts or omissions that are cons
idered unethical and unacceptable, 
and which may result in immediate revocation of privileges to use the University's computing 

resources and/or just cause for taking disciplinary action up to and including discharge, dismissal, 

expulsion, and/or legal act
ion, which may include referral for criminal investigation and/or 
prosecution. 
  [4.02  [Use Purposes
 A. Appropriate use of OSU™s computing and networking resources includes purposes 

such as instruction, independent study, authorized research, independent re
search, 
communications and official work of the offices, units, recognized student and campus 

organizations of Oklahoma State University. University computing facilities, systems, 

accounts and network resources are to be used for University
-related activit
ies for 
which they are assigned. At all times, use of the University™s information technology 

resources must comply with federal and state law, and University policies. 
  [
B. University information technology resources are not intended to be used for genera
ting 
or accessing obscene material as defined by Oklahoma or federal law and acceptable 

community standards or for creating a hostile work and/or educational environment. 
  [
C. Incidental personal use of University information technology resources is permit
ted, 
but must not interfere with a user™s performance of official University business, result 
in direct costs to the University, expose the University to unnecessary risks, or violate 

applicable laws or other University or Board policy.  [Users shall have n
o expectation 

of privacy in any personal information stored by a user on a University information 

technology resource, including University electronic mail accounts.  [Storage of any 
electronic mail messages, voice messages, file, or documents created by in
cidental 
personal use by a user must be nominal.  [
  [4.03 Personal Devices and Systems
  [Users who connect to the University™s information technology resources using privately owned 

personal computers, or other privately owned devices, consent to being scanned by the 

University™s scanning programs for security purposes, such as malicious netwo
rk traffic, while 

connected to those technology resources.
  [
 
4.04 System Abuse and Disruptive Use
 A. Users are expected to report suspected illegal activity or abuse, especially if related to 

any damage to or problems with their files, to 
abuse@okstate.edu
 or Ethics Point. Any 
defects discovered in the system accounting or system security are to be reported, as 

3-0601.3 well, so that steps can be taken to investigate and solve the problem. The cooperation 
of all users is needed 
to ensure prompt action. System administrators are required to 

report suspected unlawful or improper activities to the proper University authorities. 

Users have an affirmative duty to cooperate with system administrators in 

investigations of system abuse. 
  [
B. It is a violation of this policy to use the University™s information technology resources 

for transmitting political campaigning, commercial or personal advertisements, 

solicitations, promotions, or programs, to libel, harass, threaten, or without 

author
ization invade the privacy of other individuals. It is also a violation to use 
University information technology resources for the purpose of introducing a 

malicious program into the network, any server or any computer connected to the 

network. The use of 
any unauthorized or destructive program may result in legal civil 
action for damages or other punitive action by any injured party, including the 

University, as well as criminal action. This policy prohibits both the circumvention of 

mechanisms which prote
ct private or restricted information, systems, or networks, as 
well as use of University resources for unauthorized access to private or restricted 

systems or networks and/or damage to software or hardware components of those 

systems or networks. 
  [ C. Modify
ing or removing computer equipment, software, or peripherals without proper 
authorization is a violation of this policy. Users will use great care to ensure that they 
do not use programs or utilities which interfere with other users or which modify 

normall
y protected or restricted systems, networks or user accounts. It is inappropriate 
to encroach on others' use of the University's computers, via intended, unintended or 

negligent behaviors including but not limited to: sending of excessive electronic 

commun
ications (‚spam™), either locally or off
-campus; printing excess copies of 
documents, files, data, or programs; running grossly inefficient programs when 

efficient alternatives are known to be available; unauthorized modification of system 

facilities, oper
ating systems, or disk partitions; attempting to crash or tie up a 
University computer; damaging or vandalizing University computing facilities, 

equipment, software, or computer files. 
  [
D. Interfering with the intended use of information resources or without
 authorization, 
destroying, altering, dismantling, disfiguring, preventing rightful access to or 

otherwise interfering with the integrity of electronic information and/or information 

systems are not all, but further examples of systems abuse. 
  [4.05 User A
ccounts and Passwords
 A. The integrity of most systems is maintained by password protection of accounts. Users 

are responsible for assisting in the protection of the systems they use. The integrity 

and secrecy of an individual™s password is a key element of t
hat responsibility. The 
security of your user account is your responsibility. Users are responsible for ensuring 

account passwords are strong according to best practices and by not using:
 1. passwords from other accounts such as social media, external email, 
or other web 

sites
 
3-0601.4  [2. dictionary words
  [3. personal names
  [
4. computer system names
  [
5. adjacent keyboard combinations such as ‚qwerty™, ‚asdzxc™ or ‚12345™
  [B. Users may use only their own computer accounts and are personally responsible for 

all use of their computer account(s). Users who have been authorized to use computing 

resources (by provision of a user account) may be subject to both criminal and civil 

liability, as well as University discipline, if the user discloses a password or otherwise 
makes those resources available to others without the permission of the system 

administrator. 
  [
C. Gaining, or attempting to gain access to the account of another user eit
her by using 
programs or devices to intercept or decode passwords or similar access control 

information or by using any other means is prohibited. The negligence or naiveté of 

another user in revealing an account name or password is not considered authoriz
ed 
use. Convenience of file or printer sharing is not sufficient reason for sharing a 

computer account. Intentionally allowing or assisting others to gain unauthorized 
access to information technology resources is prohibited, regardless of whether the 

comp
uter, software, data, information, or network in question is owned by the 
University. Abuse of the networks to which the University belongs or the systems at 

other sites connected to those networks will be treated as an abuse of Oklahoma State 

University i
nformation technology resources privileges.
  [4.06 System Logging, Reviews, Privacy
 A. Users of the University™s information technology resources are placed on notice that 

all computer systems maintain audit logs and/or file logs within the computer and that 

user information is backed up periodically. Information collected and stored may 

include, but is not limited to, user identification, date and time of the session, software 

used/accessed, files used/accessed, internet use and access, when requested and 

deem
ed necessary. The University reserves the right to view or scan any file or 
software stored on the computer or passing through the network, and will do so 

periodically to verify that software and hardware are working correctly, to look for 

particular kinds
 of data or software (such as computer viruses), or to audit the use of

of the list. Persons sending to a mailing list any materials which are not consistent 

with the purpose of the mailing list will be viewed as having sent unsolicited 

material to the m
ailing list.

systems, regardless of the content of the data,
  [
b. Information related to the use of electronic communication.

  [8  [ PRINCIPLES
  [Overview
 Each member of the 
Cornell University 
community is resp
onsible for his or 
her 
actions
, including the 
use of 
information technology
 (IT)
 resources
. The university
™s 
missions, law
, and 
policy
 define appropriate use of 
IT resources
, rather than 
whatever 
a user 
is capable of doing with 
the
se resources
.  [This policy applies to anyone using Cornell
™s network
s, including faculty
 and
 staff
 members
, students,
 guests, and other members of the university community.
  [Special
 Workplace 
Considerations
 for 
Employees
 In support of Cornell University's mission, employees
 are provided computing, 
networking, and information resources for use as business tools to supp
ort their 
efforts to meet their employment
-related
 objectives. In keeping with our environment 
of freedom with responsibility, employees assume responsibility for their appropriate 
usage
 and are responsi
ble for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness 
of personal use
. Individuals are expected to be careful, honest, responsible, and civil 
in the use of computers and networks. Employees must respect
 the righ
ts of others, 
respect the integrity of the systems and related resources, and 
use these resources in 
strict compliance with the law
, university policies
, and contractual obligations. 
 Using 
IT resources in the work environment in a manner 
that
 results in inappropriate
 conduct will be addressed as an employee
 performance
 issue, even if such conduct 
does not rise to the level of a university policy violation
. Any use of 
university 
computers and networks by employees that 
is inappropriate to the workplace
, or 
otherwise 
contributes to creating a harassing
 or uncomfortable workplace, or creates 
a legal risk,
 will subje
ct the employee to counseling, formal disciplinary action
 and/or 
termination.
 Such performance concerns should be directed to the supervisor or the 
unit Human Resources
 representative.

Subject:  [Appropriate Use of Information & Technology Resources 
 
 
 
1.
 
Purpose
 
 
 
Arkansas State University System (University) invests substantial and sufficient 
resources to acquire 
and operate information technology (IT) assets, such as 
hardware, software, and Internet connections.  [The University has a responsibility to 
manage its resources in the most efficient and effective manner possible and in 
compliance with all laws, regulati
ons, and sound business practices, while at the 
same time protecting and preserving the right to academic freedom.  [Effective 
management of information technology resources will assure students, faculty, and 
staff adequate access to information and technol
ogy over the long term.  [The 
following regulations are established to define acceptable uses of 
information 
technology 
resources, and to assure that information technology resources promote 
the basic functions of the University in teaching, learning, resea
rch, administration, 
and public service.  [These regulations apply to any entity or individual accessing the 
Arkansas State University information technology infrastructure and associated 
resources.

3.
 
Arkansas State University S
ystem Appropriate Use of Information & 
Technology Resources Policy 
 
 
Information and Technology Resources may be used only for their authorized 
purposes 

 
that is, to support the research, education, administrative, and other 
functions of Arkansas State Un
iversity. 
 
 
4.
 
Process
 
 
Although this policy sets forth the general parameters of appropriate use of IT 
Resources, faculty, students, and staff should consult their respective handbooks 
and campus operating procedures for more detailed statements on permit
ted use 
and the extent of use that the University considers appropriate in light of their 
varying roles within the community.  [In the event of conflict between other guidelines 
and the System Appropriate Use of Information & Technology Resources Policy, th
e 
Appropriate Use Policy will prevail.
 
 
 
A.
 
Proper Authorization.  [
 
 
 
Users are entitled to access only those IT Resources that are consistent with 
their authorization.  [Access is limited to members of the University Community, 
faculty, staff, students, an
d other specifically authorized individuals.
 

 
B.
 
Ownership.  [
 
 
 
 
All data stored on University IT Resources is owned by the University.  [
Intellectual Property rights will, of course, be recognized as established by policy.
 
 
 
C.
 
Privacy.  [
 
 
 
Users agree to
 
access only data that they are authorized to use and/or view.  [
Privacy in an electronic environment should never be assumed and cannot be 
guaranteed.  [Because Arkansas State University is a state agency, all electronic 
communications and documents are pre
sumed to be subject to the Freedom of 
Information Act.
 
 
 
D.
 
 
Specific Proscriptions on Use.  [
 
 
 
 
The following categories of use are inappropriate and prohibited:
 
 
1.
 
Use in violation of law.  [Illegal use of IT Resources 

 
that is, use in violation 
of civi
l or criminal law or regulation at the federal, state, or local levels 

 
is 
prohibited.  [Examples of such uses are: promoting a pyramid scheme, 
accessing or distributing illegal material, copyright infringements, and making 
terroristic 
threats.
 
 
 
With resp
ect to copyright infringements, Users should be aware that copyright 
law governs (among other activities) the copying, display, and use of software 
and other works in digital form (text, sound, images, and other multimedia).  [
The law permits use of copyrig
hted material without authorization from the 
copyright holder for some educational purposes (protecting certain classroom 

automatically mean that the use is permitted without autho
rization.
 
 
 
2.
 
Use that impedes, interferes with, impairs, or otherwise causes harm to the 
activities of others.  [Users must not deny, attempt to deny, or interfere with 

mailing l

(spreading email or postings widely and without good purpose), or flooding an 
individual, group, or system with numerous or large email messages.  [Other 
behavior that may cause excessive network
 
traffic or computing load is also 
prohibited.
 
 
3.
 

University is a non
-
profit, public service organization and, as such, is subject 
to specific federal, state, and local laws regard
ing sources of income, political 
activities, use of property, and similar matters.  [As a result, commercial use of 
IT Resources for non
-
University purposes is generally prohibited, except if 
specifically authorized and permitted under University conflict
-
o
f
-
interest, 

outside employment, and other related policies.  [Prohibited commercial use 
does not include communications and exchange of data that furthers the 

of whether it has 
an incidental financial or other benefit to an external 
organization.  [Commercial advertising is strictly prohibited unless authorized 
by contract with the commercial vendor.
 
 
Utilization of IT Resources in a way that suggests University endorsement of 
any
 
political candidate or ballot initiative is also prohibited.  [Users must refrain 
from using IT Resources for the purpose of lobbying that connotes University 
involvement.
 
 
4.
 
Harassing or threatening use.  [ This category includes, for example, repeated 
un
welcome contacts with another.
 
 
5.
 
Use damaging the integrity of University or other IT Resources.  [This 
category includes, but is not limited to:
 
 
a.
  [
Attempts to defeat system security.  [Users must not defeat or attempt to 

 

 

guessing or applying the identification or password of another User, or 
compromising system/data security mechanisms.  [(This provision does 
not prohibit, however, 
the IT Organization 
or Systems Administrators from 
u
sing security 
related 
programs within the scope of their Systems 
Authority.)
 
 
b.  [Unauthorized access or use.  [The University recognizes the importance of 
preserving the integrity of data stored by individuals in IT Resources.  [
Users must honor this princi
ple by neither seeking to obtain unauthorized 
access to IT Resources, nor permitting or assisting any others doing the 
same.  [For example, a non
-
University organization or individual may not 
use non
-
public IT Resources without specific authorization.  [Priv
ately 
owned computers may be used to provide public information resources, 
but such computers may not host sites or services for non
-
University 
organizations or individuals across the University network without specific 
authorization.  [Similarly, Users are
 
prohibited from accessing IT 
Resources that they are not authorized to access.  [Furthermore, Users 
must not make or attempt to make any deliberate, unauthorized changes 
to data on an IT System.  [Users must not intercept or attempt to intercept 
or access d
ata communications not intended for that user, for example, by 

tapping phone or network lines.
 

c.  [Disguised use
.  [
Users must not conceal their identity when using IT 
Resources, exce
pt when the option of anonymous access is explicitly 
authorized.  [Users are also prohibited from masquerading as or 
impersonating others or otherwise using a false identity.
 
 
d.  [Distributing computer viruses.  [Users must not knowingly distribute or 
launch
 
computer viruses, worms, or other rogue programs.
 
 
e.  [Modification or removal of data or equipment.  [Without specific 
authorization, Users may not remove or modify any University
-
owned or 
administered equipment or data from University property or IT Reso
urces.
 
 
f.  [Use of unauthorized devices.  [Users must not physically or 
electronically 
attach any additional device to the IT infrastructure or related resources
 
that impedes, interferes, or otherwise causes harm to the IT infrastructure 
or related resource
s
.
 
 
6.
 
Use in violation of external data network policies.  [Users must observe all 
applicable policies of external data networks when using such networks.
 
 
E.
 
University Access.  [
 
 
 
In accordance with state and federal law, the University may access all as
pects of IT 
Resources, without the consent of the User.  [Such access will be made in 
circumstances including but not limited to the following:
 
 
 
1.
 
When necessary to identify or diagnose systems or security vulnerabilities and 
problems, or otherwise preser
ve the integrity of the IT Resources; or
 
 
 
2.
 
When authorized by federal, state, or local law or administrative rules; or
 
 
3.
 
When there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of law or a breach 
of University policy may have taken place and acc
ess and inspection or 
monitoring may produce evidence related to the misconduct; or
 
 
 
4.
 
When such access to IT Resources is required to carry out essential business 
functions of the University; or
 
 
 
5.
 
When required to preserve public health and safety
 
an
d/or system or data 
integrity or user privacy
.
 
 
 
University access without the consent of the User will occur only with the 
approval of the appropriate 
v
ice 
c
hancellor, or their respective delegates, except 
when an emergency entry is necessary to preserve 
the integrity of facilities or to 
preserve public health and safety.  [The University, through the Systems 
Administrators, will log all instances of access without consent.  [Systems 

Administrators will also log any emergency entry within their control for 
s
ubsequent review by appropriate University authority.  [
 
 
 
In addition to accessing the IT Resources, the University, through the 

whether or not the User is suspected of any violation
 
of this policy, when 
necessary to preserve the integrity of facilities, user services, or data.  [The 
Systems Administrator will attempt to notify the User of any such action.
 
 
 
By attaching privately owned personal computers or other 
devices 
to the 
Univer

security purposes of those resources while attached to the network.
 
 
 
Most System
s
 
Administrators routinely log user actions in order to facilitate 
recovery from system malfunctions a
nd for other management purposes.  [All 
Systems Administrators are required to establish and post procedures 
concerning logging of User actions including the extent of individually identifiable 
data collection, data security, and data retention.
 
 
 
Encrypted
 
files, documents, and messages may be accessed by the University 
under the above guidelines.
 
 
F.
 
Enforcement Procedures 
 
 
1.
 
Complaint of Alleged Violations.  [An individual who believes that he or she has 
been harmed by an alleged violation of this 
p
olicy
 
may file a complaint in 
accordance with established University grievance procedures (including, where 
relevant, those procedures for filing complaints of sexual harassment or of racial 
or ethnic harassment) for students, faculty, and staff.  [The individua
l is also 
encouraged to report the alleged violation to the Systems Authority overseeing 
the facility most directly involved, or to the 
IT Organization 
which must 
investigate the allegation and (if appropriate) refer the matter to University 
disciplinary a
nd/or law enforcement authorities.
 
 
 
2.

 Policy Statement and Purpose
  [
Bowling Green State University provides information technology 

resources to support the academic, administrative, educational, research 

and service missions of its appropriately affiliated 
members within the 

margins of institutional priorities and financial capabilities. 
 The 

information techno
logy resources provide for the u
niversity, a conduit for 

free and open forum for the expr
ession of ideas mindful of the u
niversity 
core values. 
 In or
der to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of information technology resources for intended purposes, the 

following policy has been developed. 
  [ (B)
 Policy
 Scope
  [The scope of this policy is to encompass all information t
echnology 
devices owned by the u
niversity, any device
 obtaining connectivity to the 
university
 network, and all u
niversity relevant data on these devices.
  [
(C)
 Policy 
  [
(1)
 All usage of information technology resources is to be consistent 

with all other relevant policies at
 BGSU.
  [(2)

  [(3)
 Use of information technology to access resources other than
 those 
supporting the academic, administrative, educational, research and 

service missions of the University or for more than limited social 

purposes is prohibited.
 
 
(a)
 Information technology is provided to access resources 

supporting the academic, 
administrative, education, 

resear
ch and service missions of the u
niversity.  [Use of the 
provided information technology res
ources is to be mindful 
of the u
niversity core values.  [Use of information 

technology for experimental use or limited social purposes
 is permitted, as long as it does not violate other policies or 

interfere with operations of 
the u
niversity.
  [(b)
 The legitimate use of information technology resources 

does not extend to whatever is technically possible.  [

Although some limitations are built i
nto computer 

operating system and networks, those limitations are not 

the sole restrictions on what is permissible.  [Users must 

abide by all applicable restrictions, whether or not they are 

built into the operating system or network and whether or 

not they
 can be circumvented by technical means.
  [
3341-6-7  [3  [ (c)
 Network applications and protocols that are not essential to 
carrying out the mission of the university or to conduct 
university business are neither specifically permitted nor 

specifically prohibited.  [Should suc
h a subsidiary 
application or protocol become
 a risk to the security of the 
university's information technology infrastructure, its use 

will be restricted or blocked as deemed appropriate or 

necessary, without prior notice.
 
 (4)
 All users must only access or a
ttempt to access information 
technology resources that they are authorized to use and then only 

in a manner and to the extent authorized.
  [(a)
 Ability to access information technology resources does 

not, by itself, imply authorization to do so.  [Prior to 

accessing a resource, users are responsible for ascertaining 

and properly obtaining necessary authorization.  [Accounts, 

passwords, and other aut
hentication mechanisms, may not, 
under any circumstances, be shared with, or used by, 

persons other than those to whom 
they have been assigned 

by the u
niversity.
  [A violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, 

up to and including termination
 of employment.
  [(5)
 Attempting to circumvent information technology security systems 

is prohibited.
  [(a)
 BGSU employs various technologies and procedures in the 

interest of protecting the confidentiality, availability, and 

integrity of information technology.  [Some examples of 

these technologies and procedures, include, but are not 

limited to, physical method
s, firewalls, anti
-virus software, 
encryption, and passwords.  [Circumvention or attempted 

circumvention of a security 
system creates a threat to the 

university and is not permitted.
  [A violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, 

up to and i
ncluding termination of employment.
  [
3341-6-7  [4  [(6)
 Disruption of 
university authorized activities is prohibited.
  [(a)
 All members of the BGSU community share the 
information technology resources provided by BGSU.  [

Those causing disruption to the use of information 

technolog
y resources for other community members will be 
in violation of this policy.  [Some examples include, but are 

not limited to, configuration of devices that disrupt network 

services, launching denial of service attacks, and disturbing 

public access resources
.  [(7)
 Use of information technology to conduct reconnaissance, 

vulnerability assessments, or similar activity by unauthorized 

personnel is prohibited
.  [(a)
 In an effort to protect the confidentiality, availability, and 

integrity of information technology resource
s, BGSU 
officials will investigate any discovered unauthorized 

network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, or service 

enumerations.  [While it is recognized that there are some 

valid purposes for this activity, BGSU officials are unable 

to determine int
ent and must react in a manner that will 

best protect information technology resources by assuming 

that the source of scans are malicious.  [Additionally, many 

vulnerability scanning tools utilize techniques that may be 

disruptive if not properly used.  [Ple
ase contact the ITS 
Information Security Office for authorization to conduct 

vulnerability or service assessments using BGSU 

information technology resources.
  [(8)
 Users are required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 

availability of information te
chnology.
  [(a)
 This responsibility includes practicing safe computing at all 

times when deploying or using BGSU information 

technology resources.  [Users are to care for the integrity of 

technology based information sources they are authorized 

to access and to 
ensure that information is shared only with 

other appropriately authorized users.
  [
3341-6-7  [5  [(9)
 Anonymous use, impersonation, or use of pseudonyms on an 
information technology resource to escape accountability is 

prohibited.
  [(a)
 Examples of this include, but are not limit
ed to, forging 

email or using any Internet s
ervice not affiliated with the 
university that can prevent accountability for its usage.
  [
(10)
 The use of any unlicensed spectrum space is prohibited on any 

BGSU
-owned or BGSU
-occupied property, unless it is part of the 
wireless services being deployed by the 
university.
  [(a)
 Information Technology Services (ITS) has implemented 

wireless Local Area Netw
ork (LAN) services on the BGSU 
main campus and the Firelands campus.  [While this service 

allows mobility and easier access to the BGSU network, it 

means that the air space on campus now serves as a 

medium for network connectivity.  [The use of open air 

spac
e poses a number of potentially difficult situations for 

both users and network administrators.  [Users that may 

need to make use of wireless equipment for special 

purposes such as research or other unique applications must 

contact the Technology Support Ce
nter within ITS to 
coordinate this use of wireless air space.

The u
niversity does not routinely monitor the content of material 
but does reserve the right to access and review all aspects of its 

information technology infrastructure to investigate performance
 or system problems, search for harmful programs, or upon 

reasonable cause, to determine if a user is violating a policy, State 

or Federal law.  [BGSU monitors, keeps, and audits detailed records 

of information technology usage; traces may be recorded routi
nely 
for trouble shooting, performance monitoring, security purposes, 

auditing, recovery from system failure, etc.; or in response to a 

comp
laint, in order to protect the u
niversity's and others' 
equipment, software, and data from unauthorized use or tampe
ring.  [
Extraordinary record keeping, traces and special techniques may 

be used in response to technical problems or complaints, or for 

violation of law, policy or regula
tions, but only on approval by 
university administrators specifically authorized to giv
e such 
approval.  [In addition to the privacy of individuals being respected 

under normal circumstances, the privacy of those involved in a

  [This policy replaces the Information Technology Services Network 

and Computer Policies and the Acceptable Use Policy for 

Information Technologies and is authorized by the Office of the 

Chief Information Officer (CIO) and 
has been approved by the 

appropriate university committee(s).
 This policy may be 
supplemented with additional published guidelines by campus 

units that are authorized to operate/control their own information 

technology resources provided such guidelines ar

Information Technology Security and Acceptable Use Policy
 
 
 
 
Scope: 
This policy is to be applied in addition to t
he current Michigan State University Acceptable 
Use of Computing Systems, Software, and the University Digital Network Administrative Ruling 
http://www.msu.edu/au/
This policy will describe procedures and protocols for information 
security and systems man
agement, incident response, disaster recovery, and operations and 
security. 
 
Procedures: 
 
 
I. Information Security and Systems Management 
 
Electronic records containing confidential and proprietary information should be stored on 
centralized data servers w
henever feasible. This can include databases or file servers. 
Computers used to access electronic records containing confidential and proprietary 
information shall be locked against unauthorized use when unattended (for example, 
employing a screen saver wi
th a password lock). The storage of confidential and 

strongly discouraged. If such data must be stored on these devices, the use of data 
encryption to encode the inf
ormation is strongly encouraged, to ensure its integrity in the 
event of theft of the physical device.

)
 
for policies and procedures. 
 
 
Confidential Information 
 
Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to: 
 
 

 
Social security number 
 

 
Credit card/debit card number 
 

 
Bank account numbers, Automated Clearinghouse (
ACH), Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) 
account numbers and related information 
 

 

 

 
Names, addresses and phone numbers when used in conjunction with any of the above data 

n name, or when restricted or 
protected by the individual 
 

 
Student records that are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 

(

Protected health information under the Heal
th Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA), including student number and student name pairings 
 

 
Personal financial information as defined and governed by the Gramm
-
Leach
-
Bliley Act 
(GLB) 
 

 
Resear
ch information
-
as defined and governed by federal regulation (45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50, 

hrpp.msu.edu/
)
 
 

 
Proprietary information owned, used, or in the possession of the University, such as 
c
omputer applications for which MSU owns the code or a license, or other intellectual 
property 
 

 
Employment data such as benefits enrollment, beneficiary data, and certain grievance, 
arbitration or legal proceeding documentation 
 

 
Security codes, combinat
ions, and passwords 
 
 
Proprietary Information 
 
Proprietary information means information, records, or data whose value would be lost or reduced 
by disclosure or by disclosure in advance of the time prescribed for its authorized public release, or 
whose disclosure would otherwise adversely affect the University financially. Examples of 
proprietary information includes but are not limited to: 
 

 
Res
earch data or results prior to publication or the filing of a patent application. 
 

 
Non
-
patentable technical information or know
-
how that enhances the value of a patented 
invention or that has independent commercial value. 
 

 
Information about the Univers

would increase the cost of that property for the University or decrease what the University 
realizes from that property. 
 
 
II. Incident Response 
 
 
In the event of a suspected compromise of a 

 
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REPORTING OF DATA SYSTEM SECURITY BREACHES 
 
(
itservices.msu.edu/guidelines
-
policies/data
-
breach.html
) will guide the departmental response. 
 
 
A reportable incident occurs when (a) an un
authorized person is believed to have gained 
 
the ability to access confidential or proprietary data that is stored on a University data system, or 
(b) 
a person who is authorized to access confidential or proprietary data that is stored on a 
university 
d
ata system misuses that data
. 
 
 
Upon discovery of the compromise of the data system, the following steps should be taken: 
 

 
Contact departmental IT administrator. 
 

 
Leave affected systems on and attached to the network until investigators direct otherwise 
 

 
Do not log on or perform administrative functions on the affected system until investigators 
arrive 
 

 
Record, in writing, all actions taken in connection with th
e discovery of the reportable 
incident
-
indicating date and time. 
 
 
 
 

3
 
 
III. Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity 
 
 
The Depar
tmental Research Emergency Defense (Information System) [REDIS] plan documents 
responses by individual laboratories and the BMB Stores. The plan is available through the BMB 

. 
Departmental business functions will be re
-
constituted through the loading of back
-
up information 
onto a replacement server and individual PCs. All business function information is acquired through 
university sources (Contracts and Grants, HR, etc.) and 
does not represent information that is only 
housed in BMB. Therefore, back
-
up of primary information is available from non
-
departmental 
sources. 
 
IV. Operations and Security 
 
 
The IT manager will oversee training of all users within BMB with access to conf
idential and 
proprietary information. Training will instruct users in topics such as: confidentiality, malicious 
software, and use of passwords. Periodic training updates will be conducted when necessary. 
 
Information that is classified Confidential and Pr
oprietary must be kept in a place that provides a 
high
-
level of protection against unauthorized access and not taken outside the University unless it 
can be assured adequate protection. In general, this means storing the information behind a 
physical or el
ectronic lock, for example, in an office, filing cabinet, or desk that is kept locked when 
the User is not present, or on a computer that provides strong access controls and encryption. 
Encryption consistent with University standards is strongly recommende
d for information stored 
electronically on all computers, especially portable devices such as notebook computers or 
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that 
are vulnerable to theft or loss.
 
It is the responsibility of all users to inform the IT Manager of a
ny IT equipment purchases or 
transfers. It is the responsibility of the IT Manager to update the Departmental IT Asset Log. When 
equipment is to be disposed, it is the responsibility of the IT Manager will to ensure that all storage 
media has been properly
 
cleaned and sanitized.
 
It is the responsibility of the IT Manager to conduct regular system back
-
ups and to maintain a 
secure, off
-
site storage location for back
-
up.

#ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE USE OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
(A)Purpose. To ensure compliance with the university policy on responsible use of
information technology, Kent state university establishes the following
administrative policy which supplements university policy and any guidelines or
regulations developed by individual units of the university, as well as applicable
federal and state laws.
(B)User responsibilities.
(#)University assigned accounts ("UserID"), computer and network accessaccounts are for the personal use of that individual only. Accounts are to be
used for the university-related activities for which they are assigned.
($)Sharing of access. Computer accounts, passwords, and other types of
authorization are assigned to individual users and should not be shared with
others. Individual users are responsible for the use of their accounts. If an
account is shared or the password divulged, the holder of the account may
lose all account privileges and be held personally responsible for any actions
that arise from the misuse of the account.
(%)Unauthorized access. Individual users may not run or otherwise conÞgure
software or hardware to intentionally allow access by unauthorized users.
(&)Termination of access. When individual users cease being a member of the
campus community (i.e., withdraw, graduate, or terminate employment or
otherwise leave the university), or if an individual user is assigned a newposition and/or responsibilities within Kent state university, access
authorization may be reviewed. Users must not use facilities, accounts,
access codes, privileges or information for which they are not authorized.
(')Circumventing security. Users are prohibited from attempting to circumvent
or subvert any system's security measures. Users are prohibited from using
any computer program or device to intercept or decode passwords or similar
access control information.

(()Breaching security. Deliberate attempts to degrade the performance of a
computer system or network or to deprive authorized personnel of resources
or access to any Kent state university computer or network is prohibited.
Breach of security includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(a)Creating or knowingly propagating viruses;
(b)Hacking;(c)Password cracking;
(d)Unauthorized viewing of others' Þles;
(e)Willful modiÞcation of hardware and software installations.
())Abuse of campus computer resources is prohibited and includes, but is not
limited to:(a)Unauthorized monitoring. A user may not use computer resources for
unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.
(b)Spamming. Posting a personal or private commercial message to
multiple list servers, distribution lists or news groups with the intention
of reaching as many users as possible is prohibited.
(c)Private commercial purposes. The computing and networking
resources of campus shall not be used for personal or private
commercial purposes or for Þnancial gain.
(C)Enforcement. Users who violate this policy may be denied access to university
computing resources and may be subject to other penalties and disciplinary
action, both within and outside of the university. Violations will normally be
handled through the university disciplinary procedures applicable to the relevant
user. The university may temporarily suspend or block access to an account, prior
to the initiation or completion of such procedures, when it reasonably appears
necessary to do so in order to protect the integrity, security or functionality of
university or other computing resources or to protect the university from liability.
The university may also refer suspected violations of applicable law to appropriate
law enforcement agencies.

STATEMENT
 
 

security program. Information and IT systems are vital assets that enable UMBC to 

manag
ed but the overall IT infrastructure is a distributed and shared environment. As the 
IT infrastructure grows and becomes more complex, increasing amounts of 
administrative or academic personal, proprietary, or institutional data is being stored, 
accessed, 
and manipulated electronically, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, 
disclosure, or modification. UMBC must, therefore, maintain an effective IT security 
program to mitigate the risks posed to its IT resources.
 
 
II.
 
PURPOSE FOR
 
POLICY
 
 
The purpose of th

Title:  [Professional Standards and Business Conduct -- 
Use of University Technologi
cal and Information Resources
Code:  [1-100-025 Date:  [9-1-95 Approved:  [JDM  [ Definition Technological and in
formation resources
 are defined to include data; records; software; facilities; 
equipment; storage media; networks and network serv
ices; and electronic voice, video, and multimedia 
communications. Policy  [University technological and information resources are 
provided to allow faculty, staff, and students to 
pursue the central educational mission
 of Boston College, and are to be used to the extent that they 
promote that mission -- either directly in teaching 
and research or indirectly in supporting the offices 
and agencies that maintain University operations. 
Technological and information resources are to be 
accessed and utilized in an ethical manner. All users of technological and information resources are to 
adhere to high moral, legal, and professional standards, and are expected to support the mission, and 
act in the best interests, of Boston College. (For 
additional information regarding the ethical business 
standards of Boston College, please see policy 
1-100-010
, Professional Standards and Business 
Conduct -- General Policy.)  [
All users of technological and information resources 
are responsible for the protection of University 
assets and for the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of the information to which they have access. 
Resources are not to be abused or employed in such a way as to interfere with, or cause harm or 

damage to, another person, institution, or compan
y within or outside the Boston College community. While the University encourages the exploration of 
educational and scholarly interests through the use 
of its technological resources, respect for the ri
ghts and privacy of others must be observed. 
Community members and their guests may not access the files or communications of others without 
authorization. Those who are authorized to access confidential files must respect the privacy rights of 
others and use data only for legitimate academic or administrative purposes. 
Boston College supports accessibility to technologica
l resources and strives to provide state-of-the-art, 
environmentally sound facilities for all members of the University community. The University 

acknowledges its responsibility to all faculty, st
aff, and students to provide a safe and healthful 
technical environment for work and study. 
All members of the University community are to comply with the following policies, procedures, and 
security controls. 
AccessMany of the technological and information resour
ces of Boston College may be accessed by all 
members of the University community, and by the public as well. However, access to some resources 
is restricted to specific positions or organizational
 units as determined by the appropriate unit head. 
Organizational unit heads are to 
determine and authorize the appropriate degree of access for each 
member of their units, and are to provide unit members with adequate orientation and training 
regarding the ethical use of all technological and information resources. 

Users are to take precautions to prevent the unauthorized use of their access codes. Access codes are 
not to be shared with others and their confidentiality is to be strictly maintained. In choosing access 
codes, users are to avoid the use of common words,
 proper names, readily associated nicknames or 
initials, and any other letter and/or number sequences that might easily be guessed. Users will be held 
accountable for all actions performed under their access codes, including those performed by other 
individuals as a result of user negligence in protec
ting the codes. Users are responsible for monitoring 
access on their accounts and for changing access co
des on a regular basis. If access codes become 
compromised, users are to change them immediately. 
Users are not to attempt to access, search, or copy technological and information resources without the 

proper authorization. No one is to use another individual's account, either with or without permission, 
and active sessions are not to be left unattended. Th
e provision of false or misleading information in 
order to gain access to technological and information 
resources is prohibited. Users are not to test or 
attempt to compromise internal controls, even for purposes of systems improvement. Such actions 
require the advance, written approval of the authoriz
ed organizational unit head, or must be included 
among the security evaluation responsibilities of one'
s position. Suspected violations are to be reported 
to the Data Security Administrator in the Office of Information Technology. 
Protecting Confidentiality
No user is to disclose confidential information unle
ss disclosure is a normal requirement of that user's 
position and has been so authorized. All users with
 access to confidential data are to safeguard the 
accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of that data by taking the precautions, and performing the office 
procedures, necessary to ensure that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential data occurs. Such 
precautions and procedures include the secure storage of data backups and the protection of sensitive 

data with access codes. (For information regarding 
the confidentiality of student educational records, 
please see policy 4-730-005
, Student Education Records.) 
PrivacyFor purposes of this policy, 
privacy is defined as the right of an indi
vidual or an organization to create, 
maintain, send, and receive electronic data, software, and communications files that are safe from 
examination and disclosure by others. Boston College
 recognizes that individuals have a substantial 
interest in and reasonable expectation of privacy. Accordingly, Boston College respects the privacy 
rights of all members of the University community. 
The University will not monitor users' private electronic data, software, and communications files as a 

routine matter. Users should note that some electronic files are copied to backups and stored for 
indefinite periods in centralized locations. In such instances, user deletion of an electronic file, such as 
an e-mail message, may not delete a previously archived copy of that file. 
It is a violation of Boston College policy for any member of the University community to engage in 
electronic "snooping," or, the use of technological resources for the purpose of satisfying idle curiosity 

about the affairs of others, with no substantial bu
siness purpose for obtaining access to such files. 
The University reserves the right to access and to disclose the contents of an individual's electronic 

data, software, and communications files, but will do
 so, after obtaining the proper approvals, only 
when a legitimate need exists and the urgency of the need is sufficiently strong to offset the 
University's commitment to honor the individual's privacy. Such grounds might include: (1) 
maintaining system integrity (e.g., tracking viruses)
; (2) protecting system se
curity; (3) investigating 
indications of impropriety; (4) protecting the Un
iversity's property rights; and (5) meeting legal 
obligations (e.g., subpoenas). 
Copyright Issues
Copyright is a form of protection the law provides 
to the authors of "original works of authorship" for 
their intellectual works that are "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," both published and 
unpublished (Title 17, United States Code). It is illegal to violate any of the rights provided by the law 
to the owner of a copyright. Boston College respects the ownership of intellectual material governed by 

copyright laws. All members of the University community are to comply with the copyright laws and 
the provisions of the licensing agreements that apply to software; printed and electronic materials, 
including documentation; graphics; photographs; multimedia, including musical works, video 

productions, sound recordings, and dramatic works; and all other technological resources licensed 
and/or purchased by the University or accessible over network resources provided by the University. 
Individual author, publisher, patent holder, and 
manufacturer agreements are to be reviewed for 
specific stipulations. All technological resources developed by University
 employees, students, and contractors for use by 
the University or as part of their normal employme
nt activities are considered "works for hire." As 
such, the University is considered the "author" and owner of these resources. (For information 
regarding the ownership of technological resources developed with grant funding, please see the 
Boston College Research Policies
 published by the Office for Sponsored Programs.)  [
Integrity and Protection of Technological and Information Resources
  [
• Viruses It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that any imported or exported executable code or data 

are free of any destructive code, such as a virus. To this end every precaution is to be taken by the 
user, and the Office of Information Technology 
is to be consulted for related information and 
software.  [ 
• Backups It is the responsibility of the organizational unit head or network administrator to ensure that 
appropriate procedures and resources are in place to backup data on a regular basis. Backups are 

to be stored in a location that is physically secure and that protects the confidentiality of the data. 
It is the responsibility of the individual user to perform any actions necessary to comply with 
these procedures. 
  [
• Physical Security 
All users are responsible for the physical secu
rity of their technological and information 
resources. Organizational unit heads are to he
lp ensure physical security by instituting 
procedures for the use of locked doors and/or for 
the use of the security devices made available by 
the University for the protection of equipment. To avoid loss by fire or theft, backups of 
important data are not to be stored in the same location as the originals. Adequate power 

regulators and surge suppressers are to be employed. 
  [
• University Property 
Technological and information resources that are the property of the University are not to be 

copied, altered, manipulated, transferred, retained, or removed from campus. (The ownership of 
technological resources purchased with grant funding is determined by the individual granting 
agency. For additional information, please contact the Office
 of Research Compliance and Intellectual Property Management.) The location of each physical resource is to be entered in the 
University Capital Equipment Inventory System and/or the Information Technology Inventory 
System and updated as necessary. 
Personal Use of University Technological Resources
Authorization for the personal use of University technological resources by employees is to be 

determined on an individual basis by, and at the discretion of, the responsible unit head. The use of 
University technological resources, including the network, for a revenue generating activity that 
benefits an individual employee is strictly prohibited without the express written approval of the 

cognizant vice president and the Executive Vice President. Personal telephones and data connections 
in student residence halls are considered to be part of the private residence. Student use of these and 
other University technological resources that intrudes on general University use or that utilizes 
significant resources is prohibited. 
Misuse of Technological and Information ResourcesThe use of University technological and informatio
n resources, and the resources themselves, are not to be abused in any way. Unauthorized users are not to modify, destroy, or in any other way render 
resources unsuitable for their intended purpose. Users are not to attempt to alter the restrictions 
associated with their accounts or to attempt to brea
ch internal or external security systems. Moreover, users are not to impersonate other individuals or to misrepresent themselves in any way when using 

University technological resources. 
The network is not to be used for criminal purposes 
or, for example, to post another individual's credit 
card numbers or personal access codes. External networks (e.g., FAXON, WESTLAW, NEXUS, the 
Internet, bulletin boards) are to be used in an ethical, responsible, and courteous manner, and all 

users are to adhere to the policies of these services. 
University technological and information resources are 
not to be used in a manner that is invasive or 
that diminishes their efficiency. One example of such usage involves the broadcast function. Although 

current technology enables users to broadcast voice,
 e-mail, or video messages to all members of the 
University community simultaneously, the use of this technology is restricted. Specific guidelines 

regarding network and video broadcasting are availabl
e from the Office of Information Technology or 
the Audiovisual Department. 
Handling Potentially Offensive Material with Discretion
Material is accessible on network resources which some individual
s may consider objectionable or 
offensive. Boston College does not encourage or
 endorse the access of such material except for 
legitimate academic purposes. Users are to exercise caution and good judgment if there is a reasonable 
expectation that accessed material may be considered
 objectionable by some. Such material is to be 
accessed in a private environment and in a manner that will not negatively affect those who may deem 

it objectionable or offensive. Public workstations (i.e., those in open offices, laboratories, the libraries, 
and other public places) are not to be used to access su
ch material, hard copies are not to be directed to 
public printers, and potentially offensive material 
is not to be forwarded to others without their 
consent. The use of potentially offensive language in the text of network messages or to identify 

technological resources is prohibited. The use of University technological resources for creating or 
sending nuisance, harassing, or obscene materials or messages is also prohibited. Moreover, users of 
network resources are prohibited from engaging in any activity that is proscribed by federal and/or 
state law. Communications from members of the University community are to reflect mutual respect, civility, 
and other moral standards. The use of obscene or intolerant language, and the use of similarly 
offensive graphic or video images, clearly violate th
ese standards and are considered inappropriate for 
electronic and all other forms of Un
iversity discourse. The determination of what is obscene, offensive, 
or intolerant is within the sole discretion of the University. Users should note that University 

technological and information resources may be accessed by minor children outside the Boston 
College community. 
Reporting Suspected Violations
Suspected violations of this policy are to be repo
rted to the appropriate organizational units or unit 
heads. Depending on the nature of the violation, 
the appropriate units or unit heads may include the 
University Harassment Counselor, the Office of the Dean for Student Development, the Office of 

University Housing, the responsible Vice President's office, the Data Security Administrator in the 
Office of Information Technology, or the Internal Audit Department. If a suspected violation is 
reported instead to a supervisor, chairperson, director, dean, or other responsible person, that person 
is to report the instance to the 
appropriate units or unit heads. 
Suspected violations are to be reviewed in accordance with current resolution processes. Depending on 
the nature of the violation, such processes may include the Discriminatory Harassment Complaint 
Resolution Process, the Student Judicial Procedure, or faculty and staff grievance procedures. 
Suspected violations of a less serious nature may be subject to review and educational follow-up by the 
Data Security Administrator in the Office of Information Technology. 
The University will consider the intent, effect, and seriousness of the incident in levying sanctions for 
violations of this policy. Any pe
rson who engages in any kind of 
computer or systems misuse as 
described above may be subject to disciplinary action, including the loss of computer privileges and/or 
dismissal from the University, and to criminal prosecution under the applicable state and/or federal 
laws. Whenever the University deems it appropriate, 
restitution may be sought for any financial losses 
sustained by Boston College, or by others, as a direct result of the misuse.

USA Faculty/Staff Computer Use Policy 
User Privileges and Responsibilities 
Authorization
. In general, USA colleges and departments are responsible for 
the allocation of computer resources for their faculty and staff. 
No one should 
use any University computer or network facility without authorization 
from the appropriate personnel in that office or department. 
University 
computers and networks are to be used for University purposes, i.e., to further 

the educational programs of the University. Any attempt to disrupt, degrade or 

improperly gain access to University computer resources is prohibited. 
Unauthorized wiring, altering or damaging of University
-owned computer 
equipment, including network hardware and software, is also prohibited. 
IDs/Passwords
. No one should share their 
password 
with another 
person, 
nor obtain another person's password by any unauthorized means. 

Deliberately and inappropriately observing, recording, accessing, using or 
transmitting passwords, acc
ount numbers, e
-mail addresses, phone numbers 
or credit card numbers belonging to other people is strictly prohibited. 
Administrative Devices
. An "administrative device" refers to a thin client or 
microcomputer used to access administrative computer syst
ems (e.g., 
Student Information Systems and Financial Systems). Access to 
administrative devices is limited to individuals engaging in official University 

business. All persons given unique passwords and sign
-ons are required to 
sign a Statement of Accountability, which states that this information is not to 

be shared with any other individual. (Authorized personnel should see 
Information Systems Security Policy 
for furt
her details concerning use and 
misuse of administrative devices.) 
Email
. The University email systems are to be used for University business 
only 
--not for personal business or personal gain. Users have full 
responsibility for all messages they transmit 
through the University
's 
computers, networks and systems. Consequently, all laws and rules against 
fraud, harassment, obscenity, etc., which govern all University 

communications also apply to email. Abuse of the email system may be 
grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
No Spam
. "Spam", the practice of mass
-broadcasting unsolicited email (e.g., 
commercial advertisements, chain mail, pornographic materials, political

lobbying, hate speech, racial diatribes, and religious prosely
tizing), 
is strictly 
prohibited at USA
. Viruses
. Users 
are advised NOT to download 
email 
attachments as these 
may contain malware or viruses that could infect University computers and/or 
networks. It is illegal to knowingly replicate or transmit computer viruses, or 
otherwise deliberately damage the s
ystems or files of other people. Users 
should install university provided 
Anti
-Virus software 
to provide protection 
against malware. 
Confidentiality and Security
. No one without specific authorization may 
read, alter, or delete any other person's computer files or email, even if the 
equipment and software have that capability. 
No email system is completely 
secure
. Consequently, email should not be used to transmit computer 
passwords, credit card numbers, or other confidential information about 

students or employees. Routine maintenance of the email systems may 
require or inadvertently lead to viewing some pieces. The CSC will respect the 
privacy of such mail, and will not reveal its contents to any other parties. 
However, if activities in violation of law or University regulations are 
discovered through this procedure, the CSC may report such information to 

the appropriate authorities. Departments are advised that information subject 
to 
confidentiality regulations 
should not be transmitted via these electronic 
media without prior written approval from the appropriate administrative 
offices. 
No "Hacking" or "Cracking"
. Deliberately invading the privacy of others by 
attempting to gain unauthorized access to any account or system is strictly 
prohibited. 
Internet
. All computer accounts provided to faculty/staff are intended for the 
University's work. Many University departments do encourage their 
employees to use the Internet to educate themselves, provided time and 
equipment are available. As a University employee, you are accountable for 
how you use your time on the job. In consideration of other network users, 

employees should limit bandwidth
-intensive activities (e.g., playing or 
downloading network
-based games, music or video) to those that are required 
as part of their employment. University employees are prohibited from using 

University equipment for private money
-making enterprises. Due to the real 
danger of transmitting computer viruses, extreme care should be taken in 

downloading executable files from the Internet onto Uni
versity computers. It is 
unacceptable to use University equipment or networks to view, download,

 post, print or send pornography, or other sexually explicit, profane, obscene, 
hostile, or blatantly offensive and intimidating material, including hate speech
, threats, harassing communications (as defined by law), or information that 
violates any state or federal laws. Using University equipment/networks for the 

sale of weapons, drugs or illegal substances is strictly prohibited. 
Web Pages
. All web pages running on University
-owned servers must adhere 
to USA's Web Policies, which can be viewed in their entirety from the 
USA 
Web Services web site 
. These policies govern the management of those 
electronic 
documents that represent USA and are accessible on the Internet. 
Individual University departments are responsible for the accuracy and 
integrity of the contents of their web pages, and have full responsibility for 

what they publish. The Web Services office periodically reviews USA web 
sites and links to ensure that the University is being represented appropriately 
and that all official symbols are being used correctly. Any objectionable 

content found in USA web sites or links will be subject to laws and ru
les 
against fraud, harassment, obscenity, etc. 
Software Licensing (copyright laws)
. All faculty/staff should be aware that 
uploading or downloading copyrighted material, violating the intellectual 
property rights of others, or illegally sharing trade sec
rets is 
strictly prohibited 
at USA
. All reproduction and use of computer software on University 
equipment or by University employees or students in pursuit of University 

busine
ss or instruction must be in accordance with copyright law (as set forth 
in Title 17, United States Code) and the manufacturer's condition of sale. (See 

the USA Software Policy, printed in its entirety at the end of this document.) 
Violations/Consequence
s In addition to all guidelines in the policies stated here, all USA employees are 
subject to the policies and disciplinary procedures outlined in the Staff 
Employee Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. Violations of any USA 
computer policies incur the same types of disciplinary measures as other 

University policies or 
state or federal laws (up to and including criminal 
prosecution).

  [ POLICY MANUAL  [INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
  [Number 552 Subject: Wireless Network Deployment & Access Effective Date: February 1, 2008
  [552.1  [PURPOSE Wireless network technologies play an increasingly important role at Utah State 
University. The purpose of this policy is to establish the intent, direction, and expectation with respect to the deployment (including 
installation, operation, and maintenance) of 
wireless technology at Utah State University. USU Informa
tion Technology (IT) is taking on the initiative to provide 100% wireless coverage for the institution. 552.2  [POLICY Information Technology shall design, deploy, ma
nage, and coordinate a secure wireless networking service for the University. This 
wireless system will allow faculty, staff, 
students, and sponsored guests at USU ready-access to the internet and USU infrastructure, where authorized, 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, except when system 
maintenance is required. 
Wireless access points deployed by others which 
create radio frequency interference with 
this wireless service or duplicate existing wi
reless services will be disconnected from the 
network to avoid security breaches and other IT operation problems. Separate 
deployments for research evaluation or traini
ng needs should be coordinated with IT to avoid interference and duplication. IT shall have the sole charge and responsibility for the Un
iversity™s wireless networking system including establishing procedures
 for use at USU and adopting standards consistent with current 
industry best practices.  [  [

create Ògeneric emailÓ accounts to serve specific purposes not well served by personal
accounts. The Ò
ITS Generic Email Account Request Form
 (http://its.unca.edu/policies-
and-forms)
Ó can be found on the ITS website. Typically these accounts represent
functions such as online reference service in the library and can be accessed by
multiple authorized personnel. These accounts are reviewed annually to verify their
continuing utility and use. Disused accounts are deactivated.
C. Retiree AccountsRetiree email accounts may be offered to retiring faculty and staff during their exit
interview with Human Resources. Retiree email accounts are hosted by Google in a
separate domain, ret.unca.edu. Although email and documents may not be migrated
to retiree accounts, ITS will assist retirees in migrating their Contacts to their retiree
account. Retiree accounts are provided without support by ITS.

Access to university information technology resou
rces is a privilege. Violations of the above policies and standards may result in 
penalties ranging from a reprimand and temporary loss of access, to referral to the appropriate university office for imposit
ion of further 
evaluation and possible sanctions 
including the possibility of expulsion from the university and dismissal from a position. Student 
conduct utilizing information technology resources or facilities which may violate the Code of Student Rights and Responsibil
ities will 
be referred to the Off
ice of Student Rights and Community Standards for possible disciplinary action. Certain violations of this policy 
may also be prohibited under Indiana or federal law, and are therefore subject to possible criminal prosecution.

UTHENTICATION 
S
YSTEMS
 
The primary authentication mechanis
m for all Ball State University information systems is the 
Enterprise 
Directory Authentication Service
 
(EDAS).  [All Ball State University employees and studen
ts are eligible to receive 
a Ball State
 
Computer username
 
and password for this service.
 
Generally,
 
students receive these credentials 
dur
ing the admission process.  [E
mployees obtain them by visiting the 
Unified Technology Services (
UTS
)
 
Information Desk at BL101.  [Additional authentication systems apart from the 
E
DAS 
other
 
permitted methods 
d
escribed below.
 
 
a.
 
BSU Computer Username and Password
:  [Where practical and approved, all information systems 
requiring authentication of employees or students will use EDAS.  [This system provides standards based 
LDAP, Kerberos, 
Shibboleth, ADFS and 
NTLM authentication services employing strong encryption. The 
system is also built on a distributed 
model, which
 
is highly available, secure, and interoperable with 
existing and emerging technologies and complies with Technical Password R
equirements as des
cribed 
below.
 
Contact the Office of Information Security Services (OISS) for additional information before 
attempting to integrate with this authentication system, which requires certain technical protocols be 
followed to ensure security is maintained. 
 
 
b.
 
O
ther Permitted Authentication Systems
:  [Methods of authentication other than 
what is 
described above
 
should be avoided, but are sometimes necessary due to systems incompatibility or other reasons.  [Such 
systems must be approved by OISS prior to acquisition
, development, and deployment.  [These systems 
must comply with the Technical Passwor
d Requirements described below.
 
Purchased, developed, and 
acquired systems must be evaluated to include proper support for integration with EDAS.

P
ROCEDURES
 
 
a.
 
Responsibility
:  [
Each person is individually responsible for compliance with these procedures, and for 
keeping passwords secure by not sharing or treating them in a way others may discover them.  [
Suspected disclosure or 
compromise of a password to any other person must be immediately reported 
to OISS and the password changed.
 
 
b.
 
Password Distribution Procedures
:  [Initial usernames and passwords must be distributed in a manner 
so as to limit the number of people having oppor
tunity
 
to learn the initial password.
 
Username/password 
combinations distributed on paper shall be either handed directly to the account owner immediately 
upon printing (walk
-
up stations) or delivered to the account owner via envelope sealed at the point o
f 
origin and del
ivered through a secure method.
 
Passwords shall not be saved or archived by the issuing 
office in a recoverable format for any reason.  [Contact OISS for additional information concerning 
password distribution procedures. 
 
 
c.
 
Password Reset Pr
ocedures
:  [Password resets performed through walk
-
up procedures require that the 
account owner to appear in
-
person and to present valid government or university issued picture 
identification. 
Under no circumstances may passwords be reset and released
 
to an
yone but the account 
owner without approval of the Director of Information Security
 
Services
. 
Passwords may never be given 
out over telephone for any reason.  [Automated resets such as by pre
-
registration of alternate trusted 
addresses are permissible, as a

 
traveling outside of Indiana.

d.
 
Use of Assigned Usernames and Passwords
:  [Assigned usernames and passwords are only to be used 
on offici
al university managed systems. 
Passwords used to access Ball State University information 
systems may not be
 
transmitted to any information system or service outside the university 
unless 
approved by the D
irector of Information Security Services.
 
Many
 
services external to the university rely 
on successful EDAS authentication (
using a
 
certain zero 
knowledge authe
ntication method which does 
not disclose the password to the external party)
,
 
however
,
 
approval 
is required from OISS before 
implementation. 
 
 
e.
 
Sharing of Passwords
:  [Passwords are issued to individuals and must not be shared or transferred to 
any other per
son including
 
employee
s
, friend
s
, family member
s
, vendor
s
 
or external provider.  [No EDAS 
accounts shall be used as shared
-
password accounts.  [Departmental EDAS accounts are not intended 
for shared
-
password access; proxy access may be granted to any EDAS ac
count, which will provide the 
same functionality without the need for sharing passwords.
  [
Contact the Helpdesk or the OISS for more 
information.
 
 
f.
 
Password 
Disclosure 
f
or Support Purposes
:  [
No university employee is authorized to ask or demand the 
disclosure of a password
 
in the course
 
of providing support services.
 
If you are asked for your password, 
do not disclose it and report the incident to OISS.

  [
T
ECHNICAL 
P
ASSWORD 
R
EQUIREMENTS
 
Passwords provide an important layer of information security.  [Selecting a strong password and keeping it 
confidential is an important part of securing Ball State University information assets.  [Although servers and 
systems will be configured to enforce th
ese standards as closely as 
possible,
 
the ultimate responsibility for 
compliance with these requirements and for maintaining the secrecy of passwords remains with the individual.
 
a.
 
Length
:  [Passwords may be
 
no less than twelve
 
characters in length.  [Longer p
asswords are preferred, 
as are so
-

ms not 
supporting at least twelve
 
character passwords shall be secured by some additional approved method 
providing enhanced security.  [Generally, 
longer passwords increase security as they are hard to guess.
 
b.
 
Complexity
:  [Passwords must contain a combination of at least three of the 
following groups of 
characters:
 
(1) upper case letters (2) lower case letters (3) numbers (4) special characters such a
s 
punctuation or symbols.  [Passwords may not contain the username or the proper name of the individual, 
nor may they contain information specifically identifiable to the account owner such as the nam
e of a 
pet, sibling, or spouse.
 
Password complexity enhan
ces security by reducing vulnerability to dictionary 
and related attacks.
 
c.
 
Expiration
:
 
 
All EDAS 
user account 
passwords will expire on an annual basis, thus requiring the owner to 
change the password at least once every 12 months.
 
 
The EDAS system will 
prevent users from setting 
their password to the last four passwords used previously when a password change is required. When 
an employee or student becomes
 
ineligible to have an active EDA
S account because of separation from 
the university or o
ther loss o
f eligibility, the E
D
A
S account will be disabled and all logins to the account 
disallowed as defined by automated rules tied to the student or employee record. EDAS accounts will 
be removed from the system using a two
-
stage process, with the accounts first
 
disabled (

then finally deleted permanently.

d.
 
Change Before Use
:  [Upon account creation or password reset procedures described 
above
, the account 
password must be changed
 
by the account owner before unless this function is not supported by t
he 
system
.  [
Requiring a password change before use helps insure that the active password is only known 
to the account owner.
 
e.
 
Authentication Failure Lockout
:  [
EDAS performs 
a temporary lockout after a 
consecutive
 
number of login 
attempt failures. This control is designed to prevent brute
-
force password guessing which normally 
involves attempting thousands or millions of password combinations. Account lockout should occur at 
a low number (less than 75) but more tha
n 20 
to
 
help prevent denial of service by a 
trivial
 
amount
 
of 
simple guessing. 
Temporary lockouts increase security by helping to make password guessing attacks 
infeasible. 
 
f.
 
Reporting of Password Failures
:  [Repeated failures to an account should result in 
an automatic 
EDAS 
warning message being generated and set to the account holder as well as a local systems administrator 
as well as directly to OISS.
 
g.
 
Passwords Not Stored in Unencrypted Format
:  [Systems shall not store pas
swords in an unencrypted 
format, a
nd an encrypted format which is recoverable is not permitted without authorization of the OISS.  [
In all cases where technically possible to do so, 
only a one
-
way hash of the password 
may be stored.
 
In 
no event may any system other than the Enterprise Direc
tory Authentication store 
the 
BSU Computer 
Username Passwords
; each authentication must be accomplished by a separate call to the 
authentication system or by 
an

(A)
 Policy Statement and Purpose
  [Official u
niversity email accounts are required for all BGSU students.  [
The official BGSU email address for all students will be in the form:  [

username@bgsu.edu.
  [
Undergraduate students receiving email at the official BGSU email 

address will have these messages auto
matically forwarded to their Office 
365 email box using their 
username@bgsu.edu
 address.
  [(B)
 Policy
  [At the time of admission or initial registration, all stud
ents are given a 
BGSU account. 
Students may anticipate that official university 
correspondence 
will come to them through this email account and should 
access this email account on a regular and timely basis.
  [
Additionally, all students should recognize that their BGSU account is 

currently part of the authentication process used for accessing the 

MyB
GSU p
ortal.  [MyBGSU is an essential u
niversity tool used for 
administrative and academic correspondence.  [It is expected that students 

will be required to use this tool to access one or more administrative or 

academic services 
at the u
niversity, such as gr
ade reports, class 
registration and class assignments/announcements.
  [
(1)
 University use of email 
- Email is a mechanism for official 
communication within Bowlin
g Green State University.  [The 
university expects that such communications will be received and 

3341-6-43  [2  [rea
d in a timely fashion.  [Official email communications are 
intended only to meet the academic and administrative needs of the 

campus community.  [As stewards of the process, Information 

Technology Services is responsible for directing the use of official 

stu
dent email.
  [
(2)
 Assignment of student email 
- A BGSU Account Registration Web 
site is available to allow students to set up their BGSU account 

online.  [This page is located at http://www.bgsu.edu/newaccount.
  [Admitted students will receive an information pack
et that includes 
information necessary to create their BGSU account.
  [
Students on the main campus can use the Web service or can 

register for an email account by bringing their official BGSU ID to 

the Technology Support Center in 110 Hayes Hall.  [Firelands
 students can register for an account online or by visiting the Main 

Lab in 231 North and bringing their official BGSU ID.  [Accounts 

must be created before the University can correspond with its 

students using the official email accounts.
  [
Official email a
ddresses will be directory information unless a 
student requests otherwise.
  [
(3)
 Expectations about student use of email 
- Students are expected to 
check their email on a frequent and consistent basis in order to 

recognize that certain communications may be time critical.  ["I 

didn't check my email," error in forwarding 
mail, or email r
eturned 
to the u
niversity with "Mailbox Full" or "User Unknown" are not 

acceptabl
e excuses for missing official u
niversity communications 
via email.  [Additionally, no student should share his or her BGSU 

password with any other individual.  [Such sharing co
uld facilitate 

violations of federal, state, and/or local laws and therefore is 

prohibited.
  [
(4)
 Redirecting of email 
- Students who wish to have email red
irected 
from their official u
niversity email address to another email 
address (e.g., @aol.com, 
@hotmail.com), may do s
o, but at their 
own risk.  [The u
niversity will not be responsible for the handling 

of email by outside vendors.  [Having email redirected does not 

absolve students from the responsibilities associated with the 

3341-6-43  [3  [official communication s
ent to their BGSU account.  [In order to 
forward email, please contact the Technology Support Center in 
110 Hayes Hall or by telephone at 419
-372-0999.  [
(5)
 Authentication of confidential info
rmation 
- It is a violation of 
university policies, including the Cod
es of St
udent Conduct to 
impersonate a u
niversity officer, faculty/staff member or student.  [
To minimize this risk of fraud, some confidential information may 

be made available only through MyBGSU, which is password 

protected.  [In these cases, students wil
l receive email 
correspondence directing them to MyBGSU, where they can 

access the confidential information only by authenticating.  [The 

confidential information will not be available in the email message.  [

Again, because password protection is a key compo
nent of 

MyBGSU security, students should never share their passwords or 

other identifying informati
on, except as requested by the 

university.
  [
(6)
 Privacy 
- Users should exercise extreme caution in using email to 
communicate confidential or sensitive matters, 
and should not 

assume that email is private or confidential.  [It is especially 

important that users are careful to send messages only to the 

intended recipient(s).  [Particular care should be taken when using 

the "reply" command during email correspondence.
  [
(7)
 Educational uses of email 
- Faculty will determine how electronic 
forms of communication (e.g., email) will be used in their classes, 

and will specify their requirements in the course syllabus.  [This 

"Official Student Email Policy" will ensure that all s
tudents will be 
able to comply with email based course requirements specified by 

faculty.  [Faculty can therefore make the assumption that students' 

official BGSU accounts are being assessed and faculty can use 

email for their classes accordingly.
  [(8)
 Enforcem
ent and Sanctions
  [
Use of BGSU technology resources must be completed in 

compliance with the BGSU Information Technology Policy 

(http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/cio/page52522.html).  [Any violations 

will be referred to the appropriate disciplinary authority for
 review.

Web Resource Management
 (https://administration.unca.edu/print/137)
Purpose:This document explains the University policy concerning the responsible management
of the UNC Asheville Web pages that have broad impact to both internal and external
audiences.
Scope:By the technical nature of the World Wide Web (Web), issues of distributive and
shared maintenance of these tools have broad institutional impact both internally and
externally for the University. Official Web pages and applications address campus-wide
data management needs at the division, department and unit level. This policy
provides the structure necessary to assist the university community in the design,
review, implementation and support of the Official Web Presence at UNC Asheville.
Policy:Each division or departmental unit will assume responsibility for its Web content.
Revision History

Departmental units will designate a 
Web Custodian
 for the Web content owned by
that department.
The Division of Alumni and Development will assume responsibility for communicating
through the publication of standards and guidelines the technical standards to which
divisions and departments should adhere.
A Web Committee
 made up of representatives from Public Information, Library Web
Services and Information Technology Services form the core of the committee with
rotation of other University areas in and out as relevant to current concerns and
direction objectives. The Web Committee assists in setting direction for Web design,
addresses concerns where standards of UNC Asheville's official Web presence may be
out of compliance, addresses concerns and suggestions by the UNC Asheville
community. Included in upholding standards will be review and possible removal of
the following:
1. 1. 1. Outdated Web content
2. Web content that discloses information that poses a risk to the University
3. Web content in violation of University policies or state and federal statutes
The Web Committee will inform Web Custodians and Departmental units of necessary
regulations that must be followed to insure institutional security and comply with
governmental regulations.
De
!
nitions:
Official UNC Asheville Web Pages
 are any Web pages that represent a department,
program or office that provides information in the course of regular university
business and is linked directly or indirectly (at any level) from the UNC Asheville home
page. Official UNC Asheville Web Pages include those pages whose content focuses on
conferences, lectures or other special events that are officially sponsored by UNC
Asheville or by UNC Asheville departments, programs or units.
Unofficial UNC Asheville Web Pages
 and personal Web pages may be published by
faculty, students, staff, and student clubs and organizations. Unofficial Web Pages may
not carry the official UNC Asheville template set and are subject to removal from the
server.

Official Web Presence
 is the view of UNC Asheville from a marketing and
publications point of view.
A Web Custodian
 is a University faculty or staff member who has direct
responsibility over the accessibility, content, and currency of UNC Asheville Web
pages. Students may not be Web Custodians; however the Web Custodian may
delegate that responsibility to students.

Privacy & Security

Users should not have an expectation of privacy for communications on the University
network. Con
#
dentiality of email, voicemail and other network transmissions cannot 
beassured. Therefore all users should exercise extreme caution when committing con
#
dential
information to electronic media.
Under the Colorado Open Records Act, electronic 
#
les are treated in much the same 
way aspaper 
#
les. Any o
"
cial university documents (as de
#
ned by law) in the 
#
les 
of employees of
the State of Colorado are considered to be public documents, and may 
be subject to
inspection through the Open Records Act. In such cases, the Legal Counsel 
to the Board of
Trustees should inspect the contents of the applicable 
#
les to determine 
which portions
may be exempt from disclosure. Any inspection of electronic 
#
les, 
and any action based
upon such inspection will be governed by all applicable U.S. 
and Colorado laws and by
university policy.
Certain central service and network activities from workstations connected to the 
network
are routinely logged and monitored. These activities include:
Use of passwords and accounts accessed
Time and duration of network activity
Access to web pages
Access to network software
Volume of data storage and transfers
Server space used for data and email
In case of suspected violations of UNC procedures, especially unauthorized access 
tocomputing systems, the system administrator may authorize detailed session logging. 
Thismay involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition the system
administrator may authorize limited searching of user 
#
les to gather evidence on 
asuspected violation.
Users must protect and backup critical data. UNC Information Technology is not obligated
to maintain backups of any 
#
le for any particular length of time. Individual users 
anddepartments should develop policies and practices to ensure regular backups of 
data and
implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current 
generations of
computing equipment and storage media and media readers.
All UNC department should implement policies to ensure that access to sensitive data 
isrestricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords
restricting access to information should be changed on a regular basis and systems 
should
be developed and implemented to assure password records are regularly updated 
by
appropriate supervisors
University owned computer and equipment might be examined to detect unauthorized
software 
use and to evaluate the security of the network
Default or issued passwords, such as those from a manufacturer, should be immediately
changed

resident to use these services appropriately and in compliance with all
University, city, county, state, and federal laws and regulations.
ENFORCEMENT
The Office of Information Technology reserves the right to terminate any
network connection without notice should it be determined that network
traffic generated from said connection drastically inhibits or interferes with
the use of the network by others.
Failure to comply with this  [policy may result in termination of network
services and loss of computing resource privileges. In addition, any person

found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary action as defined by current University policy.
If your in-room network connection is terminated due to violations of the
above policies, and you subsequently register legitimately or rectify the
problem, you may be charged a $30 port-reactivation fee to regain access to

E. 
PrivacyThe University recognizes that principles of academic freedom and shared
governance, freedom of speech, and privacy hold important implications for the use
of electronic communications systems and services. This Policy reßects these Þrmly-
held principles within the context of the UniversityÕs legal and other obligations. The
University respects the privacy of electronic communications in the same way that it
respects the privacy of paper correspondence and telephone conversations, while
seeking to ensure that University administrative records are accessible for the
conduct of the UniversityÕs business.
Limitations of PrivacyIt is not the intent of the University to examine or disclose electronic communication
records without the holderÕs consent. However, under limited circumstances as
described in this policy, the University may examine or disclose electronic
communications records without the holderÕs consent.
An electronic communication holderÕs consent shall be obtained by the University
prior to any access for the purpose of examination or disclosure of the contents of
University electronic communications record in the holderÕs possession, except as
provided below.
Access without ConsentThe University shall permit the examination or disclosure of electronic
communications records without the consent of the holder when (1) required by and
consistent with law; (2) when there is substantial reason to believe that violations of
law or of University policies have taken place; (3) when there are compelling
circumstances; (4) under time-dependent, critical operational circumstances; or 5) to
preserve records or information consistent with the University Litigation Hold
policy.

Automated MonitoringThe right to privacy does not preclude system administrators from maintaining and
monitoring system logs of user activity. Automated searches for Þles and
transmissions that endanger privacy, conÞdentiality of data, system security or
integrity are performed regularly to protect all users and ensure the continued
availability of University electronic communications systems and services. System
administrators may take appropriate actions in response to detection of such Þles or
transmissions.
Third Party Services
University contracts with outside vendors for electronic communications services
must explicitly reßect and be consistent with this Policy and other University policies
related to privacy. Any third party organization providing contractors to the
University shall be provided access to this policy for review prior to commencing
work for the University.
F. 
SecurityThe University makes reasonable efforts to provide secure and reliable electronic
communications systems and services. The University cannot ensure security of
data transmitted over the Internet. Information submitted via the Internet may not
be secure and could be observed by a third party while in transit. Submission of
passwords, credit card numbers or other personal information via the Internet could
result in identity theft.
Additionally, University Users and Public Users accessing the Internet should be
aware that the Internet permits access to non-University users who are not subject
to University policies, and may contain content materials, goods and services that
individual users may Þnd personally offensive or objectionable. The University does
not have the right or capability to monitor or restrict Internet content. Therefore,
the University disclaims any responsibility and liability for any conduct, content,
materials or goods and services available on or through the Internet.

G. Response to Policy Violations
When there is reason to believe that a violation of this policy has occurred, an
investigation shall be conducted. User access to electronic communications systems
and services may be temporarily suspended while an investigation is being
conducted.
If the investigation involves faculty or staff members and warrants University action,
an explanation of the causal events shall be reported to the appropriate Vice
President. In cases involving students, the OfÞce of Judicial Affairs and the Dean of
Students OfÞce shall be notiÞed. Investigating ofÞcials shall examine charges of
violations with due respect for individual privacy, the security of other users, and the
rights of due process.
Violations of University policy may result in sanctions, including but not limited to,
limitation or revocation of access rights and/or reimbursement to the University for
any expense related to the violation, including costs associated with the detection
and investigation of the violation, as well as from the violation itself. Violation of
applicable statutes may result in criminal prosecution.

Appendix A Ð DeÞnitions
Compelling Circumstances: 
Circumstances in which failure to act might result in
signiÞcant bodily harm, signiÞcant property loss or damage, loss of signiÞcant evidence, or
signiÞcant liability to the University or to members of the University community.
Electronic Communications: 
Any transfer of signals, writings, images, sounds, data or
intelligence that is created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed,
broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or
several electronic communications systems. For the purpose of this policy, an electronic
Þle that has not been transmitted is not an electronic communication.
Electronic Communications Records: 
The contents of electronic communications
created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held,
copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic
communications systems or services. This deÞnition of electronic communications
records applies equally to attachments to such records and transactional information
associated with such records.
Electronic Communication Resources: 
Telecommunications equipment, transmission
devices, electronic video and audio equipment; encoding or decoding equipment,
computers and computer time, data processing or storage systems, computer systems,
servers, networks, input/output and connecting devices, and related computer records,
programs, software, and documentation that supports electronic communications
systems and services.
Electronic Communications Systems and Services: 
Any messaging, collaboration,
publishing, broadcast, or distributions system that depends on electronic
communications resources to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, distribute,
broadcast, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print electronic records for
the purposes of communication across electronic communications network systems
between or among individuals or groups, that is either explicitly denoted as a system for
electronic communications or is implicitly used for such purposes.
Holder of an Electronic Communications Record or Electronic Communications
Holder: 
An electronic communications user who, at a given point in time, is in possession
or receipt of a particular electronic communications record, whether or not that

electronic communications user is the original creator or a recipient of the content of the
record.Matter: 
Any book, magazine, newspaper, or other printed or written material, or any
picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture, or other pictorial representation, or any
statue or other Þgure, or any recording, transcription, or mechanical, chemical, or
electrical reproduction, or any other article, equipment, machine or material. 
Obscene Matter: 
DeÞned in Section 311 of the Penal Code as any matter, taken as a
whole, that to the average person, applying contemporary statewide standards, appeals
to the prurient interest, that, taken as a whole, depicts or describes sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way, and that, take as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientiÞc value.
The prohibition regarding obscene matter does not apply to accessing, viewing,
downloading, or otherwise obtaining obscene matter for use consistent with legitimate
law enforcement purposes, to permit the university to conduct an administrative
disciplinary investigation, or for legitimate medical, scientiÞc, academic, or other
legitimate university purposes.
Possession of Electronic Communications Record:  [
An individual is in possession of an
electronic communications record, whether the original record or a copy or modiÞcation
of the original record, when that individual has effective control over the location of its
storage or access to its content.  [Thus, an electronic communications record that resides
on an electronic communications system awaiting download to an addressee is deemed,
for the purposes of this Policy, to be in the possession of that addressee. Systems
administrators and other operators of University electronic communications system and
services are excluded from this deÞnition of possession with regard to electronic
communication not speciÞcally created by or addressed to them.  [ Electronic
communications users are not responsible for electronic communications records in their
possession when they have no knowledge of the existence or contents of such records.
Substantial Reason:  [
Reliable evidence indicating that violation of law or University
Policy has occurred, as distinguished from rumor, gossip, or other unreliable evidence.

Time-dependent, Critical Operational Circumstances:  [
Circumstances in which failure
to act could seriously hamper the ability of the University to function administratively or
to meet its teaching obligations, but excluding circumstances pertaining to personal or
professional activities, or to faculty research or matters of shared governance.
University Electronic Communications Record:
  [A Public Record in the form of an
Electronic communications record, whether or not any of the electronic communications
resources utilized to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, distribute, broadcast, store,
hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print the electronic communications record
are owned by the University.  [This implies that the location of the record, or the location
of its creation or use, does not change its nature (i) as a University electronic
communications record for the purposes of this or other University policies, and (ii) as
having potential for disclosure under the California Public Records Act.
Until determined otherwise or unless it is clear from the context, any electronic
communications record residing on university-owned or controlled telecommunications,
video, audio, and computing facilities will be deemed to be a University electronic
communications record for purposes of this Policy.  [This includes personal electronic
communications.  [Consistent with the principles of least perusal and least action
necessary and of legal compliance, the University must make a good faith a priori effort to
distinguish University electronic communications records from personal and other
electronic communications in situations relevant to disclosure under the California Public
Records Act and other laws, or for other applicable provisions of this Policy. 
University Electronic Communications Systems and Services:  [
Electronic
communications systems and services owned or operated by the University, auxiliary
organization or provided through contracts with the University or auxiliary organization.
Use of Electronic Communications systems and Services:  [
To create, send, forward,
reply to, transmit, distribute, broadcast, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or
print electronic communications with the aid of electronic communication systems and
services.  [An electronic Communications user is an individual or organization who makes
use of electronic communications services.

BACKGROUND:
 
 

 
inappropriate transfer, sale, or disposal of CMU
-
owned computers, computer
-
based equipment, and digital
 
media of any kind.  [Without 
proper removal, s
ens
itive personal data as well as U
niversity licensed software packages may 
inadvertently 
remain on the hard drives or 
storage media
 
of computers and other equipment intended for transfer, sale, or disposal
.
 
 
A
t best, a
ccess to this sens
itive information and 
licensed U
niversity software by non
-
authorized 
personnel (internal or external to CMU)
 
is inappropriate. 
 
At worst
, the 
U
niversity could be 
held liable for the release of personal information and/or a
 
violat
ion of software licensing 
agreements. This
 
policy
 
guards against 
these 
possibilities
 
by requiring 
that all computers and other digital assets intended for transfer, sale, and disposal be managed 
through 
processes 
maintained by 
University Stores 
and 
the Off
ice of Information Technology
 
(OIT)
.
  [
 
POLICY:
 
 
The Office of Information Technology and University Stores will jointly maintain procedures for the appropriate removal of CM
U data 
from all computers and other digital assets prior to their transfer to another department within CMU, public sale, or dispos
al.  [The 
equipment covered under this policy is intended to be inclusive of a wide range of University
-
owned computers, computer
-
based 
equipment and 
storage media 
of all kinds, including both portable and
 
removable media
.  [
 
 
PROCEDURE:
 
 
All computers and digital assets must be transferred to OIT or University Stores for erasure prior to transfer, sale, or disp
osal.  [
Erasure 
of 
data must be confirmed as successful,
 
or the storage media will be
 
considered defective and must be destroyed (crushed, shredded, or 
rendered otherwise unusable) before 
the remaining equipment may be transferred, sold, or disposed of
.
 
 
If defective stor
age media cannot 
be separated from the device, the device must be destroyed before leaving the University.
 
 
University
-
owned computers and other digital assets known to have housed Restricted or otherwise regulated information (l
ike 
workstations or devices
 
used in clinical patient treatment areas, servers and server
-
storage with large repositories or databases of HIPAA, 
FERPA, or controlled resear
ch data on them) will be considered to be at high risk for inadvertent data loss and will have their storage 
med
ia removed and destroyed by OIT/University Stores prior to transfer, sale, or disposal of the equipment.

The requirements put forth in this policy and itssupporting policies are designed to ensure that due diligence is exercised in the protectionof information, systems and services. This policy describes fundamental practices ofinformation security that are to be applied by university organizations to ensure thatprotective measures are implemented and maintained.ScopeThe scope of this information technology policy includes university computer andtelecommunications systems and the employees, contractors, temporary personnel andother agents of the university who use and administer such systems.(D)  [ Requirements
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 2University organizations shall exercise due diligence to ensure that computer andtelecommunications systems and services that conduct or support university functions aresecure, and that the information contained within those systems and services is protectedfrom unauthorized disclosure, modification or destruction, whether accidental orintentional.(1) The following minimum security requirements provide the foundation for universitysecurity policy development and are described in more detail in this policy.(a) Risk management: Organizations shall apply risk management techniques tobalance the need for security measures (paragraph D (2)(a)).(b)Confidentiality, integrity and availability: Organizations shall ensure that theirsecurity policies, plans and procedures address the basic security elements ofconfidentiality, integrity and availability (paragraph D (2)(b)).(c)Protect, detect and respond: Security plans and policies shall include methods toprotect against, detect, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities to universityinformation and systems (paragraph D (2)(c)).(d)Identification and authentication: University information technology systems shallimplement an identification and authentication process for information systemsand services (paragraph D (2)(d)).(e)Access control and authorization: Access control and authorization policies, plansand procedures are required to protect system assets and other informationresources maintained by the university (paragraph D (2)(e)).(f)Security audit logging: Security audit logging capabilities on information systems,including computers and network devices, shall be implemented and utilized inaccordance with the risk assessment (paragraph D (2)(0).(2) Minimum security requirements:(a) Risk management. Organizations shall adopt a risk management methodologythat incolÿorates the following risk management processes:Risk assessment positions organizations to determine effectively the extentof potential threats and the associated risk. The goal of conducting a riskassessment is to identify organization-specific controls that are appropriatefor reducing or eliminating risk;ORisk mitigation addresses the prioritization, evaluation andimplementation of strategically selected controls. The goal of riskmitigation is to select and implement controls that reduce risk to anacceptable level; and
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 3Evaluation and assessment is a process comprised of activities thatrecognize and respond to new and changing risks, measure theeffectiveness of implemented controls, and modify controls to reflectchanges in the three aspects of risk management: operational, technicaland managerial. The goal of evaluation and assessment is to maintain asuccessful and effective risk management program that continuouslyevolves and responds to changing threats and opportunities.Risk management offers a practical approach to balancing security withoperational requirements and cost. The definition of acceptable risk and theapproach to managing risk can vary for each organization. Risk management is atrade-off in which a certain amount of residual risk is accepted as a balance to thecosts of incremental counten'neasures.The likelihood that adverse events will occur is determined by analyzing possibletin'eats in conjunction with vulnerabilities and potential business impact. Theformula that follows is commonly applied by the information security communityto define and measure such risks as a part of risk management. The formulafurther expresses the relationship of risk exposure factors to counterbalancingsecurity strategies in defining the level of risk:Risk =Impact x ThreatsCountermeasuresRisk factors are defined for each system being measured and receive relativeratings of high (H), medium (M), or low (L).As an example, risk factor ratings for a hypothetical web server that is linked topatient records might be as follows:Ł  [Impact - The impact of a successful attack to obtain or change recordsmight be rated as "high."Ł  [Threat - The likelihood of an attack might be rated as "medium."Ł  [Countermeasures - Alternative measures are robust and therefore wouldbe rated as "high."In this hypothetical example, the robustness of the countermeasures may reduceor mitigate the overall risk, resulting in an acceptable level of risk.(i)Organization risk management practices shall include the elementsdescribed below.(a)  [ Risk assessment.
3364-65-13 Information security fi'amework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 4All university organizations shall periodically conduct a risk assessmentof system assets that they maintain to address changing threats andorganizational priorities. Risk assessments shall:Ł  [Identify IT systems, resources and information that constitute eachsystem and prioritize the relative importance of the system assets;Ł  [Identify and document potential threat-sources;Ł  [Identify and document system vulnerabilities that could beexploited;Analyze security controls that have been implemented or areplanned for implementation that minimize or eliminate thelikelihood of a compromise occurring;Ł  [Determine the likelihood of potential vulnerabilities beingexercised by a threat-source;Ł  [Deten'nine the impact associated with the compromise of systemassets;Ł  [Determine the level of risk using a rating methodology such ashigh-medium-low;Ł  [Identify technical, operational and management controls that canmitigate or eliminate the identified risks; andŁ  [Document risk assessment results and control recommendations.(b) Risk mitigationUniversity organizations shall prioritize the implementation of mitigationactions based on the results of the risk assessment. Risks may beeliminated, mitigated, shared with one or more third parties, or accepted.If certain risks are to be eliminated or mitigated the organization shall:Evaluate and compare the security countermeasures available, andthe resources required to implement them, with the resourcesrequired to replace the system assets.Ł  [Determine which countermeasures are reasonable to employ.Establish guidelines for implementing management, operationaland technical security controls commensurate with the establishedrisk to system assets.
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 5(c)  [  [Evaluation and assessmentUniversity organizations shall periodically evaluate security controls todetermine their ongoing appropriateness and effectiveness for current andanticipated risks and update controls based upon the findings.(b) Confidentiality, integrity and availability.University organizations shall ensure that internal security policies, plans andprocedures address the fundamental security elements of confidentiality, integrityand availability. Students, patients, and employees expect that sensitiveinformation about them will be shared only with those who need access, that theinformation will not be altered either by accident or malicious intent, and that itwill be available when needed. To this end, university organizations shall:(i)Provide information and services only to those that are authorized andhave a valid business need.(ii)  [ Protect information so that it is not altered maliciously or accidentally.(iii)Ensure that information and services are provided in conjunction andaccordance with business continuity plan.(c) Protect, detect and respond.IT security plans and policies shall include methods to protect against, detect andrespond to threats and vulnerabilities. At a minimum, organizations shall:(i)Determine how much protection is needed and for how long, per theresults of the risk assessment and then develop policies and proceduresaccordingly.(ii)Review the body of security-related University of Toledo IT policy andimplement its provisions as required.(iii)Develop a methodology to detect when system assets are safe and whenthey are threatened. The methodology needs to include auditing andrecording the status of all protected system assets at intervals appropriateto the risk as defined in the assessment.(iv)Develop a security incident reporting procedure describing how to respondto security incidents that addresses "who," "what," "when," "where" and"how," in accordance with university policy on "Security IncidentResponse."(v)Identify the types of services and protocols permitted by the networksystems, both within the network and crossing the network boundary. Thefundamental policy strategy for services and protocols external to the
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 6network must be to "deny everything" and allow only specific servicesand protocols on a case-by-case basis. University organizations shallemploy security precautions for the management of such services pursuantto university policy on "Boundary Protection."(d) Identification and authentication.Based upon the risk assessment, university organizations shall implement anIdentification and authentication (I&A) process for information systems andservices that require controlled access. The identification process shall require theuser to present a valid identity using a recognizable method. The most commonform of identification is a user ID. The authentication process shall require theuser to present verification of identity in a recognizable format. The mostcommon form of authentication is a password. For I&A, university organizationsshall meet the requirements listed below.(i) System users shall have unique and individual user IDs.(ii)User identities shall be validated before issuing user IDs and other credentials.Procedures shall be established for maintaining and managing system userIDs, including procedures for establishing new user accounts, validatingexisting user accounts, and terminating former user accounts.(iii) All user credentials shall be protected from unauthorized access andalteration.(iv)A security credentials management process shall be developed that ensures theconfidentiality, integrity and availability of security credentials such aspasswords, PINs, biometrics, tokens and certificates. Password processesshall fulfill the requirements of university policy on "Password Security."(v)If a user is locked out of a system due to a forgotten password, data entrymistake while entering a password, or any other legitimate error, organizationprocedures shall verify valid identification and authentication beforepermitting access.(vi) If a university organization is using, sending or receiving legally bindingelectronic records or signatures, the I&A process shall comply with rule123:3-1-01 of the Ohio Administrative Code.(vii)An authentication process commensurate with the risk assessment of thesystem assets shall be established. Robust methods of authentication, such astwo-factor authentication or digital certificates, should be considered to limitaccess to systems that contain data requiring more secure access orinformation whose disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm.(e) Access control and authorization.
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 7University organizations shall implement access control and authorizationpolicies, procedures and plans to protect university information resources. Accesscontrol addresses the securing of systems, both the hardware components and thesoftware components. Authorization addresses the management of permissions toaccess the various system components, including processes for approving accessand restricting access. Restricting access can apply to both invalid users and validusers with limited privileges. To this end, university organizations shall:0)Secure system assets from physical access by unauthorized persons at alltimes. At a minimum, system assets shall be in the control of authorizedpersonnel or protected by a locking mechanism.(ii) Manage systems with appropriate access control processes and well-formulated access control lists.(iii) Use the least-privilege method for granting access to system assets.(iv) Subject all personnel with access to system assets to a vetting process that iscommensurate with the system assets risk assessment.(v)Ensure that systems can detect and deny unauthorized transaction attempts byany user. Unauthorized attempts shall be logged in accordance with thesecurity audit logging requirements defined in paragraph (f) below.(vi) Implement any restrictions to accessing systems outside of normal worldnghours.(vii) Ensure that the access control methodology can disable user privileges tothose who no longer require access.(f)  [Security audit logging.University organizations shall implement security audit logging on informationsystems such as computers, network devices, routers, firewalls, and applications.Audit logging shall be commensurate with the organization's risk assessmentfindings.The purpose of audit logging is to maintain a consistent and reliable record ofsystem activity. When properly implemented, audit logging can serve as apreventive measure as well as a forensic aid. A comprehensive record of"who-did-what-when" can discourage asset abuse or be a vital form of evidence toprove culpability or prosecute a perpetrator. University organizations shall:(i)Enable security audit features for system assets and configure themto be sufficient to track attempted security breaches. Organizationsshall ensure that their audit strategy captures the informationnecessary to identify who is accessing university system assets,
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 8access attempts and failures, and violations of security policy.Appropriate processes shall be put in place to review and analyzethe logs commensurate with the organization's risk assessment.Audit logs shall be protected fi'om tampering and available forreview.(ii)  [ Ensure the confidentiality and security of audit information.(iii)(3)(5)(4)(2)(E)Ensul'e a separation of duties, where possible, between personneladministering access control functions and those administeringsecurity audit logging functions. If these functions cannot beseparated, organizations shall document the reasons and develop aprocess to address conflict of interest concerns.(iv)Ensure that audit logs capture information sufficient to satisfy aninquiry to determine timing, events, impact and ownership of bothnormal system activity and violations of policy, whether security-related or business-related. Based upon a deliberate assessment ofthe organization, application, information and risk, determine anappropriate data collection scheme and retention schedule for auditlogs sufficient to associate specific users with events that breachprotocol. If logs are subject to an investigation, they shall bepreserved as long as needed.Definitions(1) Access control list. A list of entities and their authorized access rights to aresource.Authorization. A grant to a requesting entity (computer, system, person orprocess) for access to a protected system and its resources. Not all entities willhave access to all university information. Authorization requirements can beimplemented using techniques such as access control lists, file and resourcepermissions, and digital certificates.Availability. The assurance that information and services are delivered whenneeded. Certain data must be available on demand or on a timely basis.Infolanation systems that must ensure availability will likely deploy techniquessuch as uninten'upted power supplies or system redundancy.Biometrics. Biological characteristics such as fingerprint, face or retinal bloodvessel patterns used by authentication devices to allow an individual access toinformation, services or other resources.Confidentiality. The assurance that information is disclosed only to those systemsor persons who are intended to receive the information. Areas in whichconfidentiality may be important include nonpublic customer information, patientrecords, information about a pending criminal case, or infrastructure
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 9specifications. Information systems that must ensure confidentiality will likelydeploy techniques such as passwords, and could possibly include encryption.(6)Data. Coded representation of quantities, objects and actions. The word, "data,"is often used interchangeably with the word, "information," in common usage andin this policy.(7)Digital certificate. An attachment to an electronic message used for securitypurposes. The most common use of a digital certificate is to verify that a usersending a message is who he or she claims to be and to provide the receiver withthe means to encode a reply.(8)Firewall. Either software or a combination of hardware and software thatimplements security policy governing traffic between two or more networks ornetwork segments. Firewalls are used to protect internal networks, servers andworkstations from unauthorized users or processes. Firewalls have variousconfigurations, from stand-alone servers to software on a notebook computer, andmust be configured properly to enable protection.(9)Identification and authentication. The verification of the identity of a requestingentity (a person, computer, system or process). Once it is determined who mayhave access to a system, the identification and authentication (I&A) process helpsto enforce access control to the system by verifying the identity of the entity.Systems may use a variety of techniques or combinations of techniques, such asuser ID, password, personal identification number, digital certificates, securitytokens or biometrics, to enforce I&A, depending upon the level of access controlrequired to protect a particular system.(10) Integrity. The assurance that information is not changed by accident or through amalicious or otherwise criminal act. Because students, patients, and employeesdepend upon the accuracy of data in university databases, organizations mustensure that data is protected from improper change. Information systems thatmust ensure integrity will likely deploy techniques such as scheduled comparisonprograms using cryptographic techniques and audits.(11) Least-Privilege. A method for assigning privileges in a system. The objective isto assign only those privileges that are necessary to perform the requiredfunctions, and ensure that other privileges are not assigned and cannot beimproperly accessed. For example, a typical system user should not be assignedrights to read, write and execute all of a department's files when the user onlyrequires the ability to read a subset of these files to do an assigned job.(12) Malicious code. Collective term for program code or data that is intentionallyincluded in or inserted into an information system for unauthorized purposeswithout the knowledge of the user. Examples include viruses, logic bombs,Trojan horses and worms.
3364-65-13 Information security framework  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [  [ 10(13) Risk assessment. A process for analyzing threats to and the vulnerabilities ofinformation systems as well as determining the potential impact that the loss ofinformation or system capabilities would have on the organization. Riskassessments provide a foundation for risk management planning and theattainment of optimal levels of security.(14) Risk management. A discipline concerned with the planning, implementing andmonitoring of processes for the identification, measurement, control andminimization of security risks to information systems at a level commensuratewith the value of the assets to be protected. Risk management attempts tomaximize the results of positive events and minimize the results of adverseevents.(15) Risk mitigation. A systematic methodology used to reduce risk by employingone of the following risk options: a'isk assumption, risk avoidance, risk limitation,risk planning, risk transference.(16) Security controls. Management, operational and technical policies, proceduresand tools required to achieve and maintain the necessary level of assurance ofconfidentiality, integrity and availability.(17) Security token. A portable, physical device that enables pre-approved access todata or systems. An example is a security-enabled key fob.(18) System assets. Information, hardware, software and services required to supportthe business of the university, and identified during the risk assessment processas assets that need to be protected.(19) Threat. An event with the potential to cause harm to an information technologyprocess or service. A threat can be natural, human or environmental.(20) Two-factor authentication. Authentication that incorporates two elements.There are three elements of authentication: "what you know" (for example, apassword or PIN), "what you have" (for example, a digital certificate or a smartcard), and "what you are" (for example, a biometric). Two-factor authenticationis commonly used for access to systems that contain data requiring secure accessor information when disclosure would cause serious disruption or harm. It isalso known as strong authentication, although strong authentication can havemore than two elements.(21)Users. For the purposes of this policy, users are defined as employees,contractors, temporary personnel and other agents of the university whoadminister or use privately-owned (if authorized) or university-owned computerand telecommunication systems on behalf of the university.(22) Vetting process. A verification process used to validate the identity andtrustwo1ÿhiness of a person who is seeking access to computer systems andnetworks.

  [  [THE 
CONTEXT
  [ UNLV™s computing and information technology resources are dedicated to the support of the 

university™s mission and its core themes to promote student learning and success, advance and 

support 
research scholarship, and creative activity, and foster inclusion and community 

engagement. While advancing the mission and core themes, UNLV respects, upholds, and 

endeavors to safeguard the principles of academic freedom, freedom of expression, and freed
om 

of inquiry. UNLV™s commitment to the principles of academic freedom and freedom of 

expression includes electronic information.
  [The use of computing and information technology resources in a manner consistent with the 

mission and ideals of the universit
y and with the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) 
Computing Resources Policy 
requires adherence to legal statutes, approved policies, and 

responsible behavior, including:
  [ using only assigned account(s) or account information
  [respecting the privacy a
nd rights of other computer users
  [protecting the integrity of the physical environments in which information technology 
equipment resides
  [complying with all pertinent software license and contractual agreements, and 
  [obeying all UNLV and NSHE regulations, 
state and federal laws
.  [UNLV seeks to create an atmosphere of privacy with respect to information and 
UNLV 
information technology resources. UNLV 
acknowledges its responsibilities to respect and 
advance free academic inquiry, free expression, reasonable e
xpectations of privacy, due process, 
equal protection of the law, and legitimate claims of ownership of intellectual property.
 Such 
responsibilities are balanced with the acknowledgement that users should be aware that they 
should have no expectation of pr
ivacy in connection with the use of 
UNLV 
resources beyond the 
explicit provisions of university policy and applicable 
federal and state 
law (e.g., NRS 
Chapter 
239, Public Records
). UNLV is a public institution, and because the university must be able to 
respond to lawful requests and 
ensure the integrity and continuity of its operations, use of the 
university's information resources cannot be completely private.  [

PURPOSE
  [
 

of academic freedom, intellectual curiosity, openness, and integrity by defining the 
requirements and limits of appropriate use of informa
tion technology resources and 
services including computers, digital networks, and information resources at Utah State 
University. These rules are in place to protect faculty, staff, students, and the University. 
Inappropriate use exposes Utah State Univers
ity to risks including compromise of 
network systems and services, loss of confidential data, loss of the resource for legitimate 
use, and legal liability. 
 
550.2  [DEFINITIONS
 

 
Authentication credentials
 

 
userID/PIN, username/passcode or other secrets 
or k
eys used to gain access to a restricted Resource.
 

 
Capacity of Resource
 

 
some Resources have a limit that can be exceeded by 
certain uses, either causing the Resource to crash or causing unacceptable 
delays in the delivery of results.
 

 
Malware
 

 
programs th

want or even know about 

 
often giving control of the computer to outsiders 
or reporting to outsiders the private information sent from or stored on the 
computer.
 

 
Phishing
 

 
messages and/or websites that 
impersonate legitimate businesses 
(especially banks) in order to intercept authentication credentials for 
individuals.
 

 
Privilege
 

 
while access is generally granted to everyone in a relevant role, the 
right is retained by the University to revoke that acce
ss when it is in the 
interest of the University, such as to protect the Resource from use in violation 
of policy or use in excess of capacity.
 


 
Resource
 

 
Computing, Networking and Information Resources 

 
including 
end
-
user computers such as desktops, lapto
ps, PDAs, smartphones, 
Blackberries, Treos; servers; peripherals such as printers, scanners, webcams; 
firewalls; network routers; wireless access points (see USU Policy 552 
Wireless Deployment
); databases; enterprise information system; system of 
record; s
hadow systems; etc.
 

 
Restricted Resources
 

 
some Resources are available only to individuals in 
particular roles while other Resources (USU homepage, for instance) are 
available without restriction and without authentication by the user.
 

 
Role
 

 
a category o
f user who is given access to a particular restricted 
Resource; may be as general as faculty or student, or as specific as advisor or 
auditor.
 

 
Strong Password
 

 
a password that is not easily guessed by individual or 
automated guessing, and is not easily cr
acked by hackers. Strong passwords 
are generally long and are not composed of words, names, numeric sequences 
or keyboard patterns. Some central services 
automatically
 
impose a strong 
password requirement; but many desktop systems leave this good practice 
to 
the user.
 

 
User
 

 
faculty, staff, students, and guests of the University.
 
550.3
  [
POLICY 
 
USU Computing, Networking and Information Resources are provided as a service for 
use by faculty, staff, students, and guests in a responsible manner that is within 
the 
capacity of the Resource and consistent with the mission of the University.
 
Authentication credentials (e.g., ID/password) are assigned as an access privilege for 
restricted Resources that may be relevant to the role of the user as faculty, staff, stud
ent, 
or visitor. Users must maintain a strong password. Credentials must be protected from 
use by anyone other than the assigned individuals. Credentials may be revoked to protect 
the
 
Resources.
 
Users of Resources must obey relevant federal, state, and loc
al laws with
 
special attention 
to intellect
ual property laws (copyright), communications laws (libel, harassment, 
obscenity, child pornography, privacy, etc.), and government property laws (non
-
commercial use, etc.). The University will cooperate with law 
enforcement agencies 
when allegations of violation are made.
 
Users of Resources must protect the integrity of the Resource and the confidentiality of 
stored and transmitted data by following directions specific to the Resource being used 
and the data being
 
accessed. Those directions will be provided by IT or other 


gain access to the Resource o
r data (e.g., viruses, phishing, hidden malware, etc.).
 

User
-
owned equipment connected to the Un
i
versity network must be properly registered 
and managed in compliance with the separate USU Policy 551 
Computer Management
 
to 
protect against technical vulnera
bilities which will allow outsiders to gain access to the 
Resource or data.
 
University
-
owned equipment must comply with USU Policy 551 
Computer Management
, 
however users of that equipment should be alert for any indication of deficiencies in 
compliance tha
t may result in compromise to the security of the Resource or data.
 
Users are expected to recognize that the Resources being provided are subject to 
compromise and other failure at any time in spite of professional efforts in compliance 
with industry best 
practices.
 
Users should take extra precaution to protect their own privacy, to insure the 
confidentiality of their own personal identifying information, and to guard against the 
loss or destruction of their own intellectual property as a result of any comp
romise or 
failure.
 

through the Resource is subject to exposure by technical, legal, and extra
-
legal means 
beyond the control of the University.
 
USU Information Technolog
y is directed to interpret this policy and other relevant 
University policies as they apply to the changing deployment of Resources and provide 
Appropriate Use Procedures and Standards
 
that specify in greater detail the required, 
recommended or prohibited 
uses of specific Resources. Those procedures and standards 
will clarify, but not limit or change, the scope of approved policies; and will be approved 
by the IT Users Advisory Committee.
 
550.4  [ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY & PENALTIES
 
Disciplinary action or sanct
ions for violations of this policy will be in accordance with 
USU Policy 311 
Disciplinary Procedures
 
for exempt and non
-
exempt employees, USU 
Policy 407 
Academic Due Process: Sanctions and Hearing Procedures 
for faculty, and

 USA Student Computer Use Policy 
USA provides student access to computer resources through the wireless, 
JagMail (email), web servers, and departmental labs located throughout 
campus. Students using these resources must adhere to all policies of the 
University of South Alabama regarding the use of computers and computer 

networks. 
Lab privileges can be denied to anyone using University equipment for illegal 
or unethical purposes. Any illegal behavior observed in the labs will be 
reported to appropriate University officials or law enforcement agencies. 

Anyone using the lab computers in this way, or any other generally 
inconsiderate manner, will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Such 
behaviors/activities include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
Illegal Activity 
 Uploading or downloading copyrighted material
, violating the 
intellectual property rights of others, or illegally sharing trade secrets. 
(Please note that MP3 and other music files frequently fall into this 

category.) Accessing, downloading, or printing out articles solely for 
educational and research purposes, however, may be permissible under 
the fair use clause of the Copyright Law. See USA Software Policy for 
more specific guidelines on using copyrighted software. 
 Illegally sharing computer software 
via Internet, the local network, 
personal disks or any other med
ia  [Copying or transmitting material contained in copyrighted 
databases 
such as Infotrac, without permission from the source. 
 Buying or selling weapons or illegal substances 
via computer 
network. 
 Threatening or "stalking" 
others via computer network. 
 Knowingly replicating or transmitting computer viruses
, or 
otherwise deliberately damaging the systems or files of other people. 
Strictly Prohibited Behaviors/Activities 
 Trafficking in pornography 
of any kind via computer network. Please 
note that redistribution of pornography, even though web page links, is 
often illegal. 
 Activity that violates state or federal law
. This may include viewing, 
downloading, posting, printing or sending pornography, or other sexually 

explicit, profane, obscene, hostile, or blatantly offensive and intimidating

 material, including hate speech, threats, harassing communications (as 
defined by law), or information that violates any state or federal laws. 
 "Spam"
, the practice of indiscriminately sending unsolicited email (e.g., 
commercial advertisements, chain mail, pornographic materials, political 
lobbying, hate speech, racial diatribes, and religious proselytizing) to 
persons who have not indicated interest in receiving such materials. 
 "Hacking" or "Cracking"
, i.e., deliberately invading the privacy of 
others by attempting to gain unauthorized access to any account or 
system. 
 Obtaining/distributing confidential information
. Deliberately and 
inappropriately observing, recording, accessing, using or transmitting 

passwords, account numbers, e-mail addresses, phone numbers or 
credit card numbers belonging to other people is prohibited. 
 Downloading executable programs
, which might interject computer 
viruses into lab computers, is generally prohibited. Further guidance 
with regard to safe sites and appropriate downloads should be sought 
from the lab facilitator. (The University takes no responsibility for 
damage to your work or your own equipment resulting from viruses or 
files you might download via the Internet.) 
 Using University equipment, including the University's Internet 
lines, servers or web pages, for commercial gain 
.  [Unauthorized wiring, altering or damaging of University-owned 

computer equipment, 
including hardware and software. 
 Tampering 
with lab machine settings. 
Considerate Use 
 "Surfing the Net" 
on lab machines for academic enrichment is 
permitted; however, precedence is always given to students needing 

access for assigned course work. Classes in the lab with a faculty 
member also have precedence. Otherwise, lab access is allocated on a 
first-come basis. Individuals who have been on a computer for more 

than two hours should yield if others are waiting. 
 In consideration of other network users, students should 
limit 
bandwidth-intensive activities 
(e.g., playing or downloading games, 
music, and video) to those required by their curriculum. 
Violations/Consequences 
In addition to all guidelines in the policies stated here, all USA students are 
subject to the rules outlined in 
the 
Code of Student Conduct 
and the 
Student 
Academic Conduct Policy
, which are 
both published in 
The Lowdown
.

  [Violations of any USA computer policies incur the same types of disciplinary 
measures as other University policies or state or federal laws (up to and 
including criminal prosecution). 
Additional Guidelines for Students 

Sexually Explicit Material
. All students are expected to effectively 
discriminate between professional and unprofessional portrayals of nudity and 
sexuality. This is an important aspect of professional judgment in many fields 
of study. Dealing with nudity, the examination of the human body and the full 

range of human sexuality are relevant and appropriate to those in medical and 
other professions. A number of Internet sites (e.g., The National Library of 
Medicine and NIH) portray some such materials. Individuals working in 
medical school and nursing labs should expect to occasionally encounter 
nudity and professional portrayals of sexually explicit material. 
Appropriate Activity
. While the full range of free speech is supported and 
encouraged, USA students should always be mindful of the fact that the 

computer labs are located in public areas. Materials on screens visible to 
others working in the lab, materials that are deliberately or inadvertently left 
behind on the hard drive, and materials posted to the Internet from this lab 
should reflect well on the professionalism of our programs. Imposing exposure 
to inappropriate sexual materials upon student or faculty colleagues working 
nearby (or using the lab at a later time) might be construed as sexual 
harassment. Those in doubt about appropriate activity should seek faculty 
advice. 
Confidentiality
. Confidentiality is another issue affecting students using the 
labs. Under no circumstances should students leave, post or transmit 
confidential material such as research data, case reports or private notes 
about patients (or case studies) on these computers. The University takes no 

responsibility for student work left on lab machines, even if the lab facilitator 
gave permission for it to be on the machine. Any such work may, at any time, 
be erased accidentally or in routine clean-up activities. Students should not 
leave private work or communications on these computers, nor should they 
read any private information accidentally left by others. No material should be 

left on these computers without permission from the lab facilitator. 
Reliability of Information
. Students should remember that material on the 
Internet may or may not be accurate and reliable. It is critical that any 
information found on the Internet is carefully evaluated, especially with regard 
to pharmacology and health information.

Computer Security Controls and Access to Sensitive and Protected
InformationDate Originally Issued: 11-01-1991Revised: 07-01-2001, 07-01-2011Authorized by Regents' Policy 3.1 "Responsibilities of the President"
Process Owner:  [Chief Information O
!cer1. GeneralThe University provides computing services to the University community in accordance with 
UAP 2500 ("Acceptable ComputerUse") which applies to all users of University computing systems.  [This policy describes additional requirements and
responsibilities applicable to faculty, sta
", students, vendors and volunteers who are in IT-related positions or are in positions
that have access to sensitive and protected information.  [Due to the di
"ering regulatory constraints imposed upon the UNM
Health Sciences Center (HSC) and UNM Health System relative to privacy and security of health information both in the clinical
and research areas, the UNM HSC and UNM Health System are excluded from application of this Policy and shall be covered
by as restrictive or more restrictive 
IT: Administrative Policies
  [adopted by the UNM HSC and UNM Health System; provided
that the provisions of 
Section 4.  [herein relating to remote access to the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) suite of tools shall
apply to the UNM HSC and UNM Health System and HSC IT will promptly report any security violations to the University IT
Security O!ce at security@unm.edu .Management of University computing services must ensure the rights and responsibilities provided for in Policy 2500 while
also ensuring system and data availability, reliability, and integrity. Therefore, all departments operating University owned
computers, including those operated by faculty, sta
", and students, must develop departmental security practices whichcomply with the security practices listed herein.  [In addition, departments must have environment-speciÞc management
practices for business functions such as maintenance, change control procedures capacity planning, software licensing and
copyright protection, training, documentation, power, and records management for computing systems under their control.
This may be done by hiring a qualiÞed employee, sharing resources with other departments, or contracting with
UNM Information Technologies (IT).  [IT is available to assist and advise departments in planning how they can carry out
compliance with this and other computer technology-related policies. Departments must document and periodically review
established practices.Department heads or designees are responsible for computer security awareness and for ensuring reasonable protection of all
departmental computing systems within their purview against breaches of security, through methods such as virus protection,
Þrewalls, encryption, patch management, change control, and password usage. Department heads or designees should ensure
users of their systems have the necessary training for appropriate use of the system. A portion of available resources is listed
at IT: Training & Learning Resources
 .  [Prior to gaining access to UNM computers, all users must sign a Computer Use AccessAgreement
 which is available on the IT Website.  [
2.  [Access to Departmental Systems
Access to departmental computing systems must be authorized by the department head or designee. Access to Universitycomputing systems containing or transmitting sensitive and protected information must be authorized by the department head
and approved by the University designated data custodian.  [To ensure conÞdentiality, special attention should be taken when
authorizing system access to vendors and/or contractors, including those repairing and/or maintaining computers and
computing devices. When possible, it is advisable to have vendors and/or contractors sign a conÞdentiality agreement.
Computer access control also includes physical security to UNM equipment and information, such as: locks on
doors/windows for equipment and storage, locking paper Þles, and paper shredders. The department head or designee
ensures proper management of computer accounts and user identiÞcation by:
handling system user authentication securely (e.g. passwords, PIN numbers, access codes);
terminating an account in a timely manner when an individual's a!liation with the University is terminated or completed;providing guidelines for computer account locking, unlocking and appeal (e.g. IT's procedures are at 
IT: Account Locking
and Unlocking Policy ); andfollowing established policies and procedures and legal due process when violations are detected or suspected.
3. Network AccessIT provides guidelines, standards, and minimum requirements for attaching and detaching to UNM network resources and for
accessing University computing systems remotely at 
http://it.unm.edu/network/index.html .4. Access to Computer Systems Containing Sensitive and Protected
InformationAn individual who requires access to sensitive and protected information  [(i.e. ERP suite of tools, PowerPark, etc.) must
comply with UAP 2000 ("Responsibility and Accountability for University Information and TransactionsÓ)
 and must beauthorized by the data custodian responsible for the speciÞc application. All contractors and vendors who have access to
sensitive or protected information are required to sign conÞdentiality agreements prior to gaining such access.  [The data
custodian is an individual o!cially appointed to authorize access to the system and ensure application-speciÞc
security. Authorization will only be granted to those individuals with a demonstrated need to use such information and/or
electronic processes and who has taken the required training applicable to the system being requested.  [The data custodian
will advise the individual on the system speciÞc process used to authorize and gain access to the requested system.  [The data
custodian or designee must review and approve each request for access to a speciÞc system, ensure that all required training
has been taken prior to granting access, and authorizes access based on the userÕs business need and role in accordance with
application-speciÞc access procedures.  [Contact IT for list of Data custodians.
4.1. Remote AccessFor the purposes of this Policy, Òremote accessÓ is deÞned as any means by which any faculty, sta
", student employee,consultant, vendor or a!liate connects to the UNM Network using a non-UNM network device or service to access sensitive orprotected information.  [This provision applies regardless of the type of device being used or if the device is University owned
or personally owned. IT, department heads, designees and users share the responsibility for ensuring appropriate security
mechanisms are in place to preserve the integrity of the network, to preserve the data transmitted over that network, and to
maintain the level of conÞdentiality of the data at all times.  [Because of the increased level of risk inherent with remote access,
strong security measures are required.  [When a user accesses sensitive or protected information remotely, identiÞcation and
authentication of the user shall be performed in such a manner as to not disclose the password or other authentication
information that could be intercepted and used by a third party. 
4.1.1. Approval for Remote Access

Users will be allowed to access to sensitive or protected information from a remote location only upon approval by the data
custodian.  [Once approved, the user is responsible for ensuring adequate security measures are in place at the remote location
for secure transmission of agency data and protection of University computing resources. Computing devices used for remote
access must conform to minimum security controls listed in Section 6 of 
Rules of Use: Campus Data Communication Network.  [IT can assist the user in identifying the appropriate protection mechanisms necessary to protect against theft of University
resources, unauthorized disclosure of information, and unauthorized access the University network.  [The user is responsible for
ensuring devices used for remote access are protected by a Þrewall and virus scans, and contain all up-to-date security
patches. UNM recommends that users leave data on UNM servers as much as possible and not copy sensitive data, as described
in Section 4.1.2.  [herein, onto any mobile computing device.  [Storage of sensitive data and protected information on a non
UNM computer is prohibited unless a formal written exemption is granted by the data custodian. When stored remotely on a
UNM computing device the data must be encrypted.  [  [4.1.2.  [Sensitive DataUsers should be especially careful with the following types of data:
conÞdential Þnancial informationaccount names and passwords
social security and/or credit card numbers
personal contact names and phone numbersdecryption keys or pass-phrases5. System Protection
Department heads are responsible for protecting the systems under their control from system intrusion, compromise, or data
loss.5.1. Virus Protection
Virus detection and elimination software is essential to protect University data and systems. Department heads, or designees
are responsible for maintaining the latest version of an antiviral software and current updates on their computers. Systems
must have active virus protection turned on with each system scanned regularly. Assistance with virus protection and software
are available from IT at 
IT: Virus Protection

5.3. System IntegrityDepartment heads, or designees may monitor and investigate systems or jobs under their control for appropriate use of
resources, to protect or improve system performance, or in compliance with audit or legal requests. Jobs, procedures, and/or
functions may be restricted or limited to ensure system integrity. Departments must maintain current versions of system
software and security patches, especially when there are known security issues.
5.4. Data Loss Protection
For all computing systems that store or process sensitive or protected information department heads or designees are
responsible for developing, maintaining and executing backup, o
"-site storage and disaster recovery procedures for
computerized University information.  [5.5. Records Management
Department heads, or designees are responsible for computerized data retention and backup procedures that comply with
University Records Management requirements for classiÞcation and retention of University information.
6. Security Violation Handling
Department heads, or designees should detect and correct any non-compliance with this and other University computer
policies. In addition to following any College or department-mandated security incident reporting process, any and all
employees, faculty, or sta
" who reasonably believe:
there has been a breach to any University computer application or system,
there has been a breach to UNMÕs computer security controls (i.e. a computer has been hacked or somehow has been
compromised by an unauthorized person), or
there has been a violation of this Policy
are required to report the incident, within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation or breach, to the UNM
Chief Information O!cer (CIO) or the UNM IT Security O!ce.  [If the CIO or the UNM IT Security O!ce receives a security
incident report that involves healthcare-related entity or may involve protected health information, they must notify the UNM
Privacy O!ce and the HSC IT Security O!ce as soon as reasonably possible.
All investigations should follow proper investigative procedures to ensure conÞdentiality and due process. Any employee who

 Scope
 A. This
 policy applies 
to all 
colleges
 and 
units
 established by 
The
 Ohio
 State
 University 
that
 exercise any 
IT function
 relating
 to the
 mission
 of 
the
 university except
 for
 those
 specifically
 exempted in writing by 
the
 senior leadership
 of 
the
 university.
 B. This
 policy applies 
to university 
computer
 and 
telecommunications
 systems;
 faculty,
 staff,
 and 
students;
 academic
 and
 administrative
 units;
 affiliated
 entities,
 agents,
 contractors,
 and 
volunteers
 of 
the
 university who 
use and/or administer 
such
 systems.
 VII.
 Rationale
 A. The
 ability
 for
 the
 university 
to meet
 the
 daily needs
 of 
the
 academic, administrative,
 and 
research
 communities
 is facilitated,
 in large
 part, 
through
 the
 use of 
IT.
 This
 technology
 allows 
faculty,
 staff,
 and 
students
 to meet
 their
 diverse 
requirements
 (e.g.,
 collaboration,
 research,
 communication,
 etc.). 
While
 critical
 to the
 business of 
the
 university, 
these
 technologies
 also introduce 
risks. The
 risks
 and
 corresponding 
threats
 associated
 with
 IT 
are
 increasing
 in both number and
 variety.
 Information
 technology
 infrastructures
 are
 increasingly
 complex
 to implement and
 administer.
  [The
 advent
 of hacking
 tools
 and persons
 willing
 to distribute 
viruses
 and 
malicious code
 have
 increased 
the
 risks
 to IT organizations and 
the
 assets 
they
 are 
charged
 to safeguard.
 B. University 
mission
-critical
 functions
 supported
 by 
IT systems
 continue
 to expand. 
Although
 some
 data and 
systems may
 not be
 classified
 as mission
 critical,
 they
 nevertheless
 represent
 a significant
 investment
 in resources,
 may
 contain
 sensitive
 data,
 and
 are
 efficient
 methods
 of providing 
a wide 
range
 of education 
related
 services.
 Coupled with
 overall 
system
 integration and inte
rconnectivity,
 university 
systems
 and 
networks are increasingly at 
risk
 to intrusions, 
misuse
 of data, and other attacks 
from
 both
 internal and 
external sources.
 C. A successful
 security
 framework
 is reliant
 upon strong
 leadership
 support
 and
 a comprehensive
 body of effective
 and
 efficient 
IT security
 standards
 and procedures 
that:
 1. Promote
 public 
trust,
 2. Ensure
 continuity
 of services,
 3. Comply
 with
 legal
 and
 contractual
 requirements,
 4. Recognize 
risks
 and 
threats,
 and
 5. Protect 
systems assets
.  [VIII.
 Enforcement
 Failure
 to comply
 with
 these
 policies 
may
 result
 in suspension
 of access
 to information
 assets
 and information 
systems 
or both and
 may
 also 
result
 in disciplinary action,
 up 
to and
 including
 termination
 and
 criminal
 prosecution.

  [ POLICY MANUAL  [INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
  [Number 554 Subject: Banner Identification Number Effective Date: February 1, 2008
  [554.1  [PURPOSE It is the intention of this policy to recognize that Banner 
identification (ID) numbers will 
be treated as public identifiers, rather than
 Social Security Numbers, with appropriate 
office practices which recognize the non-confidential status of the Banner ID number.  [
554.2  [POLICY Banner ID numbers are unique, public identif
iers for members of the Utah State 
University community to be used by the offi
cial system-of-record and for other purposes 
where it is important to distinguish among similarly named members of the USU 
community. Because of their public nature, Banner ID numbers do not constitute proof of 

identity.  [  [ BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS  [

POLICY STATEMENT
 
University information is a valuable asset to the University of Minnesota and requires appropriate protection. 
Unauthorized use or disclosure of data 
protected by laws or contractual obligations could cause severe harm to the 
University or members of the University community, and could subject the University to fines or government 
sanctions.
 
In order to manage these risks, units and University community
 
members must ensure that their electronic devices 
and other resources which store, transmit, or process University information meet the information security processes 
and standards contained in the
 
appendices
of this policy, and all pertinent laws or contractual obligations. Examples of 
standards include controls related to data storage, access controls, security protection software, and awareness.
 
This policy also applies to personall
y owned devices used for University business.
 
Enforcement
 
Employees must report known non
-
compliance with any requirement of this policy to University Information Security 
(
security@umn.edu
).
 
Individual University co
mmunity members who do not comply with this policy or the University's information security 
standards may be denied access to University IT resources and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and 
including termination.
 
Exceptions
 
Units unable to meet
 
a requirement within the information security standards must obtain an exception through the 
exception request procedure.
 
Units may specify additional more stringent requirements within their physical or administrative areas of responsibility.
 
The Univers
ity Chief Information Officer or delegate may allow exceptions to this policy after consultation with the unit 
and the appropriate compliance officer.
 
REASON FOR POLICY
 
This policy will help to:
 

 
comply with legal and contractual requirements to protect 
data;
 

 
safeguard University IT resources from accidental or intentional damage and the data stored or accessed by these 
IT resources from alteration or theft of data; and
 


 
designate the appropriate level of security requirements for securing IT resources

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 
1.
 
If my smart phone or other electronic device only supports use of numbers, not 
alphabetical and 
special characters, is that acceptable authentication?
 
For electronic devices that do not support use of complex passwords for authentication, use a non
-
obvious 
number sequence. For example, do not use your employee ID or part of your 
phone number. See
 
Account 
Management Standard related information
 
for complex password features.
 
2.
 
On my University
-
owned computer, why do I need to use 
a password after the screensaver is 
activated and why is the time so short?
 
The password helps protect you from malicious use of your computer or others viewing of your display when 
your computer is not attended. The screensaver prevents anyone who steals 
or finds your laptop from using 
the computer, acting as you, stealing data, etc. See
 
Operating System Access Control Standard
 
for other 
settings that help protect data and your computer.
 
3.
 
How does th
e Information Security policy relate to vendor solutions?
 

Vendor solutions also need to meet the Information Security Policy and the information security controls 
contained in the policy.

Information Technology
WMU Server Registration Policy
PURPOSEThis policy has been developed in the interest of system and data security and
establishes rules for allowing servers to access the Internet.
SCOPE
This policy is intended to help prevent malicious users from accessing
unregistered or unintentionally installed servers. Many newer software
products install servers on machines, possibly without the aministrator's or
user's knowledge.
POLICY STATEMENTS
All unregistered servers are restricted to the internal WMU network,
WMUnet. That network is commonly called the intranet. Only registered
servers are allowed to participate in the Internet. Intranet servers will
continue to operate on campus without interruption. Test and development
servers should be registered but they will not be granted access from the
Internet. Users requiring access to these systems from off-campus must use
VPN services.
Servers which require access to and/or from outside the Internet must:
Be approved by the requesting user's department or division leader.
Have a documented, demonstrated need not met by an existing server.
Successfully pass security scans performed by information technology.
Be operated in a secure manner. This includes installing patches and
upgrades in a timely manner.
Comply with 
E-Commerce review committee standards

Server registration requirements
In order to register a server, the following information is required:
Name, phone number(s), campus address, and wmich.edu email address of
the University employees who are the primary and backup administrators
responsible for the maintenance of the server hardware and software.
Physical location, name, and IP address of the server.
Operating system and version of the server.
Server software version.
Server support software.
Applications being accessed by remote users and/or applications
interacting with the Internet.
Classify data stored or accessed.
Responsibility of server administrators
Keep current with security patches. Evaluate and expeditiously apply
within 60 days.
Maintain operating system at level recommended by vendor.
Properly restrict access to sensitive information and comply with WMU
data policies.
Ensure that an administrator, or a designate, be available during working
hours for problem resolution.
Provide a current list of contacts (with emergency phone numbers) that can
be reached in critical situations during non-business hours.
To deactivate a server, or to turn ports off, send email to 
oit-
serverregistration@wmich.edu
 with the server IP address and ports to
remove.
For servers containing University mission critical or protected information,
having an approved SSL certificate, no self-signed certs, installed is required.
Self-signed certificates must be removed from the server. It is recommended
the server be physically located in the information technology machine room
in the University Computing Center.
JUSTIFICATION

Unrestricted servers could pose serious security threats to WMUnet. The
implementation of a server registration policy is intended to minimize the
security risk and data exposure while continuing to provide needed,
uninterrupted access.
ENFORCEMENT
Server administrators will be subscribed to a WMU email list that is used to
distribute important security related information.
Server administrators are expected to read, and when appropriate, act on
information relative to server security issues in a timely manner. In critical
situations, it may become necessary to contact server administrators or
backup administrators at any time. In the event they cannot be contacted, it
may become necessary to power off the server or disconnect the server
from the network without warning.
Patches must be installed within 60 days of first notification
of vulnerabilities identified as "critical" or "high".  [Failure to maintain
servers at current security patches will result in blocking off-campus access
and/or removal from the network.
A list of all registered servers will be maintained and made available to the
registered users upon request.
Unregistered servers must be configured to use the default port, and access
to them will be blocked at the firewall.
If a server is found running on a non-standard port, the machine will be
removed from WMUnet without notice.
Server administrators will be contacted on a regular basis to ensure that
their server registration information is up to date. If an administrator fails
to respond to these inquiries, it may result in their server being
disconnected from the network or being blocked from access.
A server registration form
 is provided. You will be taken to IT Direct service
management system. Bronco NetID and password required.
A server deregistration form
 is provided. You will be taken to IT Direct
service management system. Bronco NetID and password required. 
A digital certificate request form
  [is provided. You will be taken to IT Direct
service management system. Bronco NetID and password required.
A digital certificate renewal form
 is provided. You will be taken to IT Direct
service management system. Bronco NetID and password required.

Mississippi State University 
Operating Policy and Procedure Use of Information Technology Resources  [PURPOSE Mississippi State University's (MSU) informati
on technology resources service a large number 
of faculty, students, staff, and others.  [This policy addresses the responsibilities of the University and of all users of these information technology (IT) resources. 
POLICY All users are required to use University IT resources in an effective, efficien
t, ethical, and lawful manner. Use of Mississippi State University's IT
 resources must be consistent with the mission 
of the University and all applicable laws and policies. 
GUIDELINES Security 
Each user is responsible for ma
intaining the security of electronically stored information, as 
specified in the University™s Information Security Policy, 
OP 01.10, and associated Information 
Security Program.  [Such responsibil
ities include, but are not limited to: 
 Accounts, passwords, and other types of authorization are assigned to individual users and must not be shared with others. 
 Each user should be aware of computer viru
ses and other malicious computer programs 
and take steps to avoid being either their victim or propagato
r. Minimally, each user must 
ensure that appropriate and current antivirus software is operational on all personal computers and that virus definitions are kept current. 
Digital and Electronic C
opyright Infringement: 
The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 34 
CFR Section 668 requires universities which receive federal student aid funds to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material.  [MSU is committed to an 
aggressive plan of education, deterrence, and 
remediation to protect MSU students, faculty, an
d staff, as well as the rights of copyright holders.  [All users of University IT resources must understand that copying, using, downloading, 
uploading, sharing, or otherwise distributing copyrighted material (includi
ng, but not limited to, 
music, movies, books, articles, and computer so
ftware) without explicit permission of the 
copyright owner or agent or as allowed by OP 01.20 (Policy on Use of Copyrighted Works for 
Education and Research) is a violation of federal law and MSU policy.  [ ﬁIllegal downloadﬂ refers to the 
inappropriate electronic transfer of a copyrighted material from 
one computer to another across a network; ﬁPeer to
 Peer file sharingﬂ means using a particular 
type of software designed to share electronic files or resources between two or more computers 
across a network.  [Peer to Peer (P2P) software such as BitTorrent, LimeWire, and Kazaa is often 
used to facilitate illegal downloads and file sharing.  [The Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Associatio
n of America (MPAA), the Business Software 
Alliance (BSA), and other such groups aggressive
ly seek out potential copyright infringements 
perpetrated by users of P2P software, and they aggressively pursue violators.  [RIAA and MPAA both maintain lists of legal alternatives to
 illegal downloading on their web sites at http://www.riaa.com/
 and http://www.mpaa.org/
.  [MSU maintains additional information 
regarding legal download alternatives at 
http://filesharing.msstate.edu/
. Usage Examples 
University IT resources must be used only in accordance with the law and guidelines defined in this and related policies. Examples of appropria
te and acceptable use of IT resources include, but 
are not limited to: 
a. Academics 
b. Research 
c. Outreach and service 
d. University business-related activities 
e. Legal downloading of music and video from le
gitimate sites such as those recommended by 
the RIAA and MPAA. 
Examples of inappropriate and unacceptable use 
of IT resources include, but are not limited to: 
a. Illegal downloading or sharing of copyrighted materials, such as music, movies, and 
software b. Using IT resources to harass or threaten others (see OP 91.100 and OP 03.03) c. Downloading or displaying obscene or pornographic material/images 
d. Negligently, or intentionally and without au
thorization, accessing or 
attempting to access, altering, interfering with the operation of, damaging, or destro
ying all or part of any IT 
resource e. Use or attempted use of electronic accounts, access codes, passwords, or other electronic identification credentials assigned to others
 or electronically impersonating others f. Commercial advertising 
or political campaigning 
g. Use of IT resources for non-University business or for-profit purposes of the user or for political purposes h. Use of IT resources in ways that adversely impact the University™s IT environment or its 
users Privacy 
OP 01.25 (Privacy of Electronic Information) defi
nes the balance between the University™s 
responsibilities and users™ expectations of privacy when using IT resources owned or provided by MSU.  [
Academic Freedom 
Free expression of ideas is central to the academic
 process. However, the 
University may remove 
any electronic information from its systems if it is determined that: 
a. The presence of the information involves i
llegality (e.g., copyrighted material shared 
inappropriately and software used in violation of a license agreement). 
b. The information in some way endangers IT re
sources or the information of other users 
(e.g., a computer worm, virus, or other destructive program). 
c. The information is inappropriate because it
 is inconsistent with the mission of the 
University or is otherwise not in complianc
e with the legal and ethical usage governed by Federal or State law or regulation or with University or Board of Trustees policies. d. The cost of maintaining the information 
is deemed prohibitive by the responsible 
administrative unit. 
e. The owner of the information is no longer authorized for access to University resources. Employee Personal Use 
Employees of the University are permitted incidental personal use of MSU IT resources, subject 
to review and reasonable restrictions by the employee™s supervisor; adherence to applicable University policies and state and federal law; and as long as such usage does not interfere with 
the employee™s accomplishment of his or her job 
duties and does not result in any additional costs to the University (See 
OP 01.19, Misuse of University Assets
).  [
Student Personal Use Students of the University are permitted personal use of MSU IT resources, subject to review and 
restrictions as defined by law and University policy including OP 91.100 (Code of Student Conduct). Sanctions and Appeals Under federal law first-time offenders who co

  [  [  [I. PURPOSE: 
 The University of Miami™s information technology resources have been assembled to facilitate 
the pursuit of excellence in the University™s missions of teaching, research, and service. These 
pursuits are founded upon the basic principles of academ
ic freedom and freedom of expression 
which transcend the means of communication used to convey these messages. The proliferation 
of technology continually provides new and different means of communicating the results of 
these endeavors, which must be adequ
ately managed and protected while recognizing these 
very important principles. The opportunity to use computing systems and software, as well as 
internal and external data networks, is important to all members of the University community. To 
preserve that 
opportunity for the full community, each individual student must comply with 
institutional and external standards for acceptable use of these shared resources. Although 

modest personal use of University
-supplied technology resources may improve the skills 
of 
individual users and otherwise contribute indirectly to the University™s mission, these resources 
should be used primarily for University
-related educational and administrative purposes. By 
using University information technology facilities and resource
s, users agree to abide by all 

related University policies and procedures, as well as applicable federal, state, and local law. 
Violations may result in University disciplinary action or referral to appropriate external 
authorities.

 SCOPE:
 [Intentionally O

 III.
 POLICY:
  [The University of Miami maintains a computing system for the academic and administrative use 

of faculty, staff, and students. The University strives to provide a robust, resilient, and reliable 
information technology infrastructure to enab
le excellence in scholarship and education through 
the effective and innovative use of computers and information technology. The University of 
Miami computing systems and network are resources provided for all members of the University 
community. Because c
omputing and network resources are shared, individuals should use the 
systems responsibly in pursuit of academic and administrative functions, and in doing so, are 
not to infringe on the rights, integrity, or privacy of others or their data. In using the c
omputing 
systems and network, individuals and groups must abide by standards of lawful and ethical 

behavior.
 
 Acceptable Use of Info Tech Resources by Students
 Policy
 2  [IV.
 DEFINITIONS:
 N/A
 V. PROCEDURE:
 A. Use of the University of Miami™s computing systems and network is a privilege that carries 
numerous obligations. By u
sing the University of Miami™s computing systems and network, 
you (the ﬁUser(s)ﬂ) agree to abide by the following User Obligations:
  [Responsible and Lawful Conduct. By using the University of Miami™s computing systems 

and network, Users agree that informati
on posted on or distributed through the systems 
or network contains no obscene material; no advertising material or promotional material 
promoting products or services, except as may be permitted pursuant to University World 
Wide Web Policies 
- A047; no ma
terial which constitutes libel, slander or invasion of 
privacy or publicity rights; no violation of copyrights or trademarks; no incitement to riot 
or violence; and no violation of federal, state or local law. This paragraph is not intended 
to limit academ
ic freedom.
  [Respect for the University of Miami™s Computing Systems and Network administration. 
Users should use the systems and network in a way that promotes the University of 
Miami™s academic mission. Accordingly, when it is necessary to perform systems
 administration, or, in order to protect the University of Miami™s legal interests, network 

administrators may access all files and data on the University Computing Systems and 
Network. In addition, the University may monitor and/or review any user ID, use
r activity, 
files, and data on the University systems and network, ﬁfreezeﬂ or remove access to any 
files or data which the University reasonably believes violates User Obligations in 
accordance with applicable University policies.  [
  [Responsible Use of Com
puting and Networking. Users may not obstruct any others™ 
work by using unnecessarily large amounts of system resources (such as disk space, 
output devices, CPU time, and network bandwidth) or deliberately causing any machine 
to crash or shut down. Given t
he finite capacity of available systems, Users must be 
responsible in their use of resources so as not to interfere unreasonably with the activity 
of other users.
  [Responsible Use of Accounts. Users may not give away or share any userid and 

password, for an
y reason, or under any circumstances. Users may not use someone 
else™s account, either with or without permission. Individual accounts cannot be 
transferred to or used by another individual. Users also agree that attempts to gain 
access to any account not 
belonging to them or to a system on which they are not an 
authorized user will be treated as a violation of University policy, and their computing 
privileges may be revoked.
  [Responsible Use of Bandwidth. The University of Miami is committed to providing 
adequate network capacity for the academic and administrative computing needs of the 
University community. As desktop computers and servers have become a part of 
everyday life on campus, the volume of information transmitted through the University 
network ha
s grown significantly. The growth in network use has increased the need for 
responsible use of the network resources, as excessive network traffic can interfere with 
the academic and administrative functions of the University. Members of the University 
com
munity must employ good judgment in the use of the network. If the network is 
hindered by servers or computers using excessive bandwidth, those machines will be 

disconnected.
  [Respect for Copyright. Distribution of material copyrighted by another violates f
ederal 
law unless the distribution is with permission or license, or constitutes fair use of the 

 Acceptable Use of Info Tech Resources by Students
 Policy
 3 copyrighted material. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the 
University, once notified of alleged copyright violations, will disconnect f
rom the network 
the server or computer of the individual(s) involved. The individual who is distributing the 

copyrighted materials is responsible for any copyright infringement.
  [Respect for System Security. It is the responsibility of every User to protect
 the integrity 
and security of the data in personal accounts. Each User must accept responsibility for 
all matters pertaining to the proper use of personal accounts; this includes choosing safe 
passwords and ensuring that file protections are set correctly
.  [Respect for the Ownership of Proprietary Software. Users must not make or use 
unauthorized copies of proprietary software, even when that software is not physically 
protected against copying.
  [Users are given access to the University of Miami™s computing 
systems and network 
because they are tools to help them meet their academic goals. This access, however, is 
a privilege, not a right. Preventing others from fulfilling their academic or business
-related 
goals by using the system irresponsibly is not permit
ted.
 B. Examples of usage that could result in disciplinary action include, but are not limited to:
  [Using computing or network resources for the purpose of harassing another individual or 

group
  [Using computing or network resources for a commercial purpose
  [Sen
ding electronic chain mail or mass unsolicited mail
  [Maintaining a server that contains files for which you do not have proper permission to 

store or redistribute
  [Altering e
-mail or Usenet headers to hide the identity of the sender/poster or to attribute 
the e-mail or posting to someone other than the sender/poster
  [Using talk, write or IRC (inter
-relay chat) resources in an abusive or frivolous manner
  [Accessing or transmitting obscene material in violation of federal, state or local law. 
  [Posting inappropria
te material to Usenet or a Web site
  [Using large amounts of disk space to store files not related to your academic pursuits
  [Excessive use of programs for non academic purposes in a manner that taxes the 
system™s resources.
  [Attempting to gain access to any c
omputing, network, academic or business resources 
which you are not authorized to use, including those of third parties. 
  [Using server resources to engage in activities in violation of federal, state or local law or 

other University policies.
 The Universit
y of Miami will hold responsible the owner of any account through which security 
violations or irresponsible use occurs or individuals who inappropriately obtain and/or make 

use
 of another User™s account or password. The University of Miami also reserves t
he right to 
withhold computing privileges from those who do not abide by the letter or intent of this policy 

document. Violations of this policy by the students referenced below shall be referred to the 
following offices for appropriate disciplinary action

role
-
based access controls and the principles of least privilege with University 
employees being granted access only to those Information Assets and IT Resources 
they need to fulfill the responsibilities of their position.
 

 
Support the activities and responsibilities of Information Owners, Data Stewards and 

 

 
Manage risk to Information Assets and IT Resources through

Introduction
A polytechnic university must excel in helping its users understand and conduct their teaching,
learning and administrative e
!
orts so as to be leaders in the responsible uses of such powerful
and increasingly pervasive technologies.  [Cal Poly has established, posted and communicated a
detailed 
Responsible Use Policy (RUP)
 outlining the respective responsibilities and required
actions by members of the campus community regarding responsible use of the UniversityÕs
information technology (IT) resources. 
The intent is to be clear and current in identifying the critical issues that impact the use of these
resources and to o
!
er speci
"
c policy and procedural guidance that expands understanding of
campus requirements while encouraging compliance. The full policy describes the legal and policy
requirements with which the University must comply in order to function e
!
ectively in todayÕs
complex information rich teaching and learning environment, providing de
"
nitions, examples and
context where appropriate.
This document summarizes the key policy requirements and includes a brief overview of its
guidelines to encourage users to understand how and why they should wisely and e
#
ciently use
campus IT resources and become aware of the important laws and practices in place to ensure
they comply with the policy and its requirements.  [While this summary provides a good starting
point, each user is responsible for being fully aware of the RUP and its implications to personal
conduct. Please take time as soon as possible to 
read and review the RUP in its entirety
.  [For more
information, contact 
it-policy@calpoly.edu
The Information Services O
#
ce of the CIO will continue to solicit user feedback to insure that the
policy is clear, well understood and communicated, and kept current to the issues and factors
that underlie the role and uses of IT throughout the University.
PrefaceAs a public institution of higher education, Cal Poly is committed to fostering an educational
climate in which students, faculty and sta
!
 can approach their respective roles with a sense of
high purpose and in which they may study and work free from harassment and intimidation.
The  [RUP recognizes that personal viewing or transmittal of potentially o
!
ensive digital materials
(for example, sexually explicit materials) may result in excessive use of campus computer and
network resources inconsistent with professional responsibilities and ethical standards. Such
practices may also result in educational and work environments that are hostile or are perceived
to be hostile.
In consequence, all members of the campus community are advised that the University does not

condone and will not tolerate any such actions that are proven to constitute excessive use, to
create a hostile work environment, or to have the e
!
ect of harassing or intimidating members of
the campus community. In addition, any viewing or transmitting of illegal materials (for example,
child pornography or obscene materials) is explicitly prohibited.
The University also emphasizes that its policies are not aimed to impair free expression and open
inquiry or unduly to restrict access to any lawful digital materials by those who would do so within
the guidelines of the RUP.
Applicability
The RUP applies to all users and all IT resources provided by the University and its direct a
#
liated
partners in support of Cal PolyÕs core academic mission and to enable users to access,
communicate, store, retrieve, and transmit messages, digital 
"
les, and images.  [The RUP also
relates to the impact and consequences such actions of individuals or groups may have on the IT
infrastructure and identi
"
es suitable conduct where such conduct is known or described as part
of law or acceptable practice.
Additional use policies and terms and conditions may be in place for speci
"
c resources provided
by Information Technology Services (ITS) or other Cal Poly units.  [Users must become familiar with
any policies when agreeing to use IT resources provided by or on behalf of the Cal Poly. 
Commercial IT services also require compliance with their use policies and users should be aware
of them as well to the extent they could be di
!
erent and in some cases more restrictive.
Rights and Responsibilities
Computers and networks can provide access to resources on and o
!
 campus, as well as the
ability to communicate with other users worldwide.  [Such open access is a privilege, in much the
same way as a driverÕs license is granted and requires that the individual user know what is
expected of them and that they act responsibly.
The principal concern of the RUP is the e
!
ective and e
#
cient use of IT resources to insure that
the resources are used in a manner that does not impair or impede the use of these resources by
others in their pursuit of the mission of the University.  [Users must respect the rights of other
users, respect the integrity of the systems and related virtual and physical resources, and observe
all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.
Users are responsible for staying informed of applicable laws and regulations governing the use
of IT resources and, when unsure, to seek advice and guidance from the full RUP as posted and
issued and from the appropriate University o
#
cials assigned to advise on such matters.

Existing Legal Context
All existing laws (federal and state) and University regulations and policies apply, including not
only those laws and regulations that are speci
"
c to computers and networks, but also those that
apply generally to personal conduct.
Critical issues that impact the conduct of users with respect to IT
resourcesIT resources are provided to support the UniversityÕs core mission of education, research and
service and such use has priority over all other uses.
Electronic mail and computer 
"
les are considered private to the full extent of the law.
The scrutiny of content will not be the normal practice of o
#
cials in determining how IT
resources are used; however, the University will act on alleged violations that concern
content or speci
"
c uses and will investigate such claims as appropriate.
The University reserves the right to limit access and to use appropriate means to safeguard
its resources, preserve network/system integrity and ensure continued service delivery at all
times, including routine monitoring of IT resources.
All members of the University are responsible for ensuring that their handling of information
about individuals is consistent with university policies and federal/state laws on the privacy
of such information.
Certain activities will not be considered misuse when clearly authorized by appropriate
university o
#
cials for designated educational or administrative purposes, including security
or performance testing, provided they do not interfere with other uses of campus resources.
Responsible use will be given priority over the current or potential design, capability or
functionality of speci
"
c technologies and resources.
Access to IT resources implies a degree of risk that users may encounter Òo
!
ensiveÓ
materials.  [As a matter of policy, the University protects expression by members of its
community. However, in exceptional cases, such materials may present a hostile
environment under the law and warrant certain restrictive actions.
The impact of a single user or group of users (e.g., residence halls) on campus IT resources
will be of direct interest and primary concern in determining how the RUP is applied.
Compliance and Enforcement
Users may be held accountable for their conduct under any applicable University policies,
procedures, or collective bargaining agreements.  [Enforcement will be based upon receipt of one
or more formal complaints about a speci
"
c incident or through discovery of a possible violation in
the normal course of administering IT resources. 

Complaints alleging serious misuse will be directed to those responsible for taking appropriate
disciplinary action.  [Appeals of university actions resulting from enforcement of this policy will be
handled through existing disciplinary/grievance processes. First o
!
enses and minor infractions
are generally resolved informally by the entity responsible for the resource.  [Repeat o
!
enses and
serious incidents may lead to formal disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or
termination.  [Misuse may result in the loss of computing privileges and prosecution under
applicable civil and criminal statutes.
Reporting Irresponsible or Inappropriate Use
Suspected infractions of this policy should be reported to ITS at 
abuse@calpoly.edu

I.
 
Principles
.
 
 
The following principles address the general philosophy of the University 
of North Texas on computer use and security. These principles apply to and
 
are 
binding on all users of University computer resources:
 
A.
 
Authorized Use
: The University of North Texas provides computer resources for 
the purpose of accomplishing tasks related to the University's mission.
 
It should be noted that the use of some of the
 
computers, networks, and software 
located on or off the University campus may be dedicated to specific research, 
teaching missions or purposes that limit their use or access.
 
Students, including registered students as well as incoming students who have 
pa
id their fees, shall be allowed to use the University's computer resources for 
school
-
related and personal purposes, subject to this policy and other applicable 

Page 
2
 
of 
11
 
 
University policies; state and federal law; and as long as personal use does not 
result in any 
additional costs to the University. Graduating students will have their 
computer accounts terminated after the next long semester. Non
-
enrolled 
continuing students may retain their computer account(s) for up to twelve 
months.
 
An employee of the University 
shall be allowed to use computer resources in 
accordance with this and other applicable University policies. Incidental personal 
use of computer resources by employees is permitted, subject to review and 
reasonable restrictions by the employee's supervisor
; adherence to applicable 
University policies and state and federal law; and as long as such usage does not 
interfere with the employee's accomplishment of his or her job duties and does 
not result in any additional costs to the University. New employees s
hall gain 
immediate access to university computing resources upon the presentation of 
employment verification by the appropriate school, college, or department 
official. When an employee terminates employment for any reason other than 
retirement, his or he
r access to the University's computer resources will be 
terminated immediately unless specifically authorized by the Associate Vice 
President for Computing and Chief Technology Officer. Retired employees may 
retain access to computing services.
 
B.
 
Freedom of 
Expression
:
 
Censorship is not compatible with the goals of the 
University of North Texas. The University will not limit access to any information 
due to its content as long as it meets the standard of legality. The University does 
reserve the right, howeve
r, to place reasonable time, place and manner 
restrictions on freedom of expression on its computer systems.
 
C.
 
Privacy
:
 
Users of the University's computer systems should be aware that 
computer use may be subject to review or disclosure in accordance with the
 
Texas 
Public Information Act and other laws; administrative review of computer use for 
security purposes or in regard to a policy or legal compliance concern; computer 
system maintenance; audits and as otherwise required to protect the reasonable 
interest
s of the University and other users of the computer system. Anyone using 
the University's computer systems expressly consents to monitoring on the part 
of the University for these purposes and is advised that if such monitoring reveals 
possible evidence of
 
criminal activity, University administration may provide that 
evidence to law enforcement officials. Further, all users should understand that 
the University is unable to guarantee the protection of electronic files, data or e
-
mails from unauthorized or i
nappropriate access.
 
D.
 
Intellectual Property
: All members of the University community should be aware 
that intellectual property laws extend to the electronic environment. Users should 
assume that works communicated through the computer network are subject t
o 
copyright laws, unless specifically stated otherwise.
 
E.
 
Valuable assets
: 
Computer resources and data are considered valuable assets of 
the University. Further, computer software purchased or leased by the University 

Page

Student Guide
OverviewThe following is an abridged guide to the UC Electronic Communications Policy (ECP) which governs
use of campus electronic resources including, but not limited to, computer labs, email, iLearn, wireless
network, and virtual private network (VPN). By using UCR campus electronic resources you are
agreeing to abide by the ECP. The complete version of the ECP, as well as the ECP Overview and
Implementation at UCR, is available online at 
http://cnc.ucr.edu/policies.html
Acceptable Use of UCR Electronic Resources:Allowed:Instructional and research related purposes
Sending and receiving e-mail
Accessing the Internet
Creating web sites
Not Allowed:
Illegal activities
Violations of University policies
Use of electronic communications resources for commercial benefit or personal financial gain
Utilizing the UniversityÕs name and/or seal without appropriate approvals

UCR or any department, unit, or sub-unit of the university unless appropriately authorized to do
soCausing excessive strain on any campus electronic communications resource or unwarranted or
unsolicited interference with othersÕ use of electronic communications
Student ECP Guidelines

What you can expect as an Electronic Communications user atUCRAccess and access restrictions
Policy enforcement
Security, confidentiality, and privacy
What is considered acceptable use1. Instructional and Research related purposes
UCR electronic resources are primarily intended for instructional and research purposes,
including class-related activities, academic research, and administrative tasks that support
instruction and research. For example, students may use iLearn to obtain class materials,
complete coursework, and interact with classmates and instructors on class-related topics for
academic purposes. Students may, and are expected to, use resources such as GROWL and
email for administrative tasks such as financial aid and managing enrollment.
2. Sending and receiving e-mail
UCR students may use campus electronic resources for sending and receiving e-mail. This
includes the use of UCR email, and the use of the campus network to access UCR email or other
e-mail accounts. Use of campus resources for sending and receiving e-mail is limited by federal,
state and local laws, as well as other University policies. E-mail activities that are prohibited
include using UCR e-mail accounts or servers to send spam, for harassment, or for commercial
purposes such as selling textbooks and other items or operating a business.
3. Accessing the Internet
UCR students may use campus Internet resources, including the wireless network, Internet
access provided by the campus computer labs, and residential Internet connections provided in
the residence halls and some off-campus housing. Access to the Internet is subject to individual
departmental policies of the department providing the service, as well as federal, state or local
laws, other parts of the ECP, or other University policies. Internet activities that are prohibited
include using the UCR network to illegally download copyrighted materials such as movies or
music, excessive bandwidth usage that is significant enough to adversely affect campus network
performance, and deliberately or unknowingly spreading computer worms or viruses over the
Internet.

4. Creating web sites
Students may post websites on their R'Mail accounts and campus servers. For example, students
may post personal websites on their student R'Mail accounts. Student groups may post websites
on departmental web servers with the permission of the hosting department. Use of campus web
servers is limited by the policies of the individual departmental owners of any specific web server,
as well as other sections of the ECP. Web sites hosted on campus servers or R'Mail may not be
operated for commercial purposes or financial gain, such as operating a business or offering
services for profit. Furthermore, student or student organization web sites may not imply that they
represent UCR without appropriate authorization.
Uses that are prohibited1. Illegal activities
All relevant federal, state and local laws apply when using University electronic communications.
This includes laws that prohibit cyberstalking, digital copyright infringement, disrupting Internet
and UCR intranet networks and systems (for example by transmitting viruses, sending spam, or
hacking into othersÕ transmissions or files), and tapping telephones.
2. Activities that violate University policies
All relevant University policies apply when using UCR electronic resources. This includes policies
on sexual harassment, other forms of harassment, and intellectual property. For example,
campus resources may not be used to obtain or re-distribute the intellectual property of others
without authorization, including research, presentations, etc. Campus e-mail and iLearn may not
be used to send spam or other harassing e-mails. In addition, individual departmental resources
may only be used in accordance with departmental policies and with appropriate authorization.
3. Commercial benefit or personal financial gain
Campus electronic resources may not be used for commercial benefit or personal financial gain.
For example, student websites may not be used to sell products or services. iLearn may not be
used to sell textbooks or to post notices advertising rooms for rent.
4. Activities that utilize the UniversityÕs name and/or seal without
appropriate approvals
Users of UCR electronic resources must abide University policies regarding the use of the

University's name, seal, or trademarks. The University's name, seal, or trademarks may not be
used without appropriate authorization. For example, students may not include the University
seal on their web sites without authorization.
5. Activities that imply representation on behalf of UCR
Users of campus electronic resources may not give the impression that they are representing or
otherwise making statements on behalf of UCR or any department, unit, or sub-unit of the
university unless appropriately authorized to do so. For example, the University name may not be
included in advertisements for products or services without authorization to imply University
affiliation or endorsement.
6. Activities that cause excessive strain on campus electronic
communication
University electronic communications resources shall not be used in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to cause excessive strain on any campus electronic communications
resource or unwarranted or unsolicited interference with othersÕ use of electronic communications
resources. For example, campus electronic resources may not be used to send spam, or engage
in denial of service attacks. In addition, excessive bandwidth usage that adversely affects
campus network services is prohibited and may result in restrictions on access.
7. Operation of personal web servers
Students may not operate personal web servers on campus, or using campus resources. This
includes, but is not limited to, the establishment of web servers for commercial purposes,
personal websites, or student organization websites.
What you can expect as an Electronic Communications user atUCR1. Access and Access Restrictions
Duration of Access
 Ð In general, students' access to electronic communication services will
remain active for approximately one quarter, or indefinitely in the case of Gmail services, after
graduation.
Accessibility
 Ð All electronic communications resources intended to accomplish the academic and
administrative tasks of the university shall be accessible to allowable users with disabilities in

compliance with law and UC policies
Access Restrictions
 Ð Access to campus electronic resources may be restricted when there is
substantial reason to believe that violations of law or University policies have taken place, or
when time-dependent, critical operational circumstances exist. Violations of law or University
policies include, but are not limited to, excessive bandwidth use, enough to cause network
performance degradation, continued off-campus complaints with no response from on-campus
responsible parties, verified open proxy or open mail servers, attacks observed by Computing &
CommunicationsÕ network monitoring systems, and verified DMCA violations. 
Backups and Data Retrieval
 Ð Electronic communications are routinely backed-up. However, this
is only for purposes of system integrity and reliability, to support data restoration in cases of disk
failure, and is not designed to provide for future information retrieval.
2. Policy Enforcement
Violations of the ECP may result in revocation of access to a single resource, a combination of
resources, or all campus electronic resources, depending upon the violation. 
UCR in general cannot be the arbiter of the contents of electronic communications. Moreover, the
University cannot always protect users from receiving electronic communications they might find
undesirable or offensive.
3. Security, Confidentiality and Privacy
UCR does not routinely collect information about an individualÕs web use or sites visited. Except
when tracking a reported crime, the monitoring of web sites visited, or web use in general, is not
permitted under U.C. policy. UCR does not routinely inspect, monitor, or disclose electronic
communications without the holderÕs consent. UCR only permits the inspection, monitoring, or
disclosure of electronic communications records without the consent of the holder of such
records when one or more of the following apply AND when appropriate campus approvals have
been obtained: When required by and consistent with law.
When there is substantiated reason to believe that violations of law or of University
policies have taken place.
When there are compelling circumstances for which failure to act might result in significant
bodily harm, significant property loss or damage, loss of significant evidence relating to
violations of law or UC policies, or significant liability to the UCR or to members of the

university community
When there are time-dependent, critical operational circumstances and when failure to act
could seriously hamper the universityÕs ability to function administratively or to meets its
teaching or research obligations.

 OverviewThis policy provides guidance and establishes expectations for members of the university community as
they use Ohio university's information technology resources.
Access to computer systems and networks owned or operated by Ohio university imposes certain
responsibilities and obligations and is granted subject to university policies, and local, state, and federal
statutes.
Access to the university's computing facilities and resources is granted solely to Ohio university faculty,
staff, registered students, and individuals outside the university who are authorized to use services that
have been made available through Ohio university. 
The university reserves the right to limit, restrict, or
extend computing privileges and access to its resources.
A.
Computers and network resources can provide access to resources both on and off campus. 
Such open
access is a privilege, and requires that individual users act in a responsible and acceptable manner.
Acceptable use always is ethical, reflects academic honesty, and shows restraint in the consumption of
shared resources. 
Acceptable use demonstrates respect for intellectual property, truth in
communication, ownership of data, system security mechanisms, and individuals' right to privacy and
freedom of intimidation, harassment, and unwarranted annoyance. 
The university considers any
violation of acceptable use principles or guidelines to be a serious offense and reserves the right to test
and monitor security, and copy and examine any files or information resident on university systems
allegedly related to unacceptable use.
Those who do not abide by the policies and guidelines in this policy should expect at least suspension of
computer privileges and possible disciplinary action in accordance with university rules for misconduct

through the internet with people you do not know personally.
 
The following guidelines should be 
followed:
 
 

 
Never arrange a meeting alone with someone you have made contact with on the internet
 

 
Never disclose any personal in
formation through the internet to unknown persons or 
organisations

site.
 
 
7.
 
Use of Portable data storage devices (memory sticks, etc.)
 
 
You 
are encou
raged to avoid the use of portable memory devices and to use web based (cloud) 
storage such as your college OneDrive account instead. Portable storage devices regularly fail 
and can be lost and should only ever be used to backup files that you have stored 
elsewhere. If 
you insist on using portable storage devices then:
 
 

 
Do not store personal data (any data which would be convered by the data protection act).
 

 
You are responsible for the information and data held on your USB memory devices.
 

 
You can only use y
our own data storage device if it does do not require a mains electricity 
supply

these devices while they are using the wi
-
fi network.
 

 
Students and 
staff must register their devices before accessing the network using the 

student) or via the staff menu on Moodle (if you are a member of staff).

Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual - Policy 2500:
Acceptable Computer UseDate Originally Issued: 11-01-1991Revised: 03-21-1997, 08-28-2000, 07-01-2011, 03-26-2015Authorized by RPM 3.1 ("Responsibilities of the President")
Process Owner:  [Chief Information O
!cer1. GeneralAs an institution of higher learning, the University of New Mexico encourages, supports, and protects freedom of expression as
well as an open environment to pursue scholarly inquiry and to share information.  [Access to information technology (IT), in
general, and to the Internet, in particular, supports the academic community by providing a link to electronic information in a
variety of formats and covering all academic disciplines. The computing and network resources, services, and facilities of the
University are limited and should be used wisely and carefully with consideration for the needs of others.  [As with any
resource, there is a possibility of misuse. In an attempt to prevent or mitigate such misuse, this policy outlines proper and
improper behaviors, deÞnes misuse and incidental use, explains rights and responsibilities, and brießy reviews the
repercussions of violating these codes of conduct. 
The University of New Mexico provides computing services to University faculty, sta
", students, retirees, and speciÞed outside
clients of the University and periodically to visitors and guests. These services are intended primarily for furthering the
education, research, and public service mission of the University and may not be used for commercial purposes or proÞt-
making. This Policy is applicable to all individuals using University-owned or -controlled computer equipment, communications
equipment, data network (wired and wireless), storage devices, and computer-related facilities, whether such persons are
students, sta", faculty, or third-party users of University computing resources and services. All University policies including,
but not limited to, intellectual property protection, privacy, misuse of University equipment, sexual harassment, hostile work
environment, data security, and conÞdentiality shall apply to the use of computing services. 
1.1. Departmental Computer Use Policies and Procedures
Individual departments within the University may deÞne Òconditions of useÓ for information resources under their control. 
These statements must be consistent with this overall policy but may provide additional detail, guidelines, and/or restrictions. 
Such policies may not relax, or subtract from, this policy.  [Where such Òconditions of useÓ exist, the enforcement mechanisms
deÞned within these departmental statements shall apply.  [Individual departments are responsible for publicizing both the
regulations they establish and their policies concerning the authorized and appropriate use of the equipment for which they are
responsible. In such cases, the department administrator shall provide the cognizant vice president and the University Director
of IT Security with a copy of such supplementary policies prior to their implementation.  [Where the use of external networks is
involved, policies governing such use also are applicable and must be adhered to.
1.2. Computing ServicesFor the purposes of this policy computing services include the following:All University data, information, and information systems (including computer applications used by the University that are

hosted elsewhere),
All University computer hardware, software, multi-media, and communication services including all computer resources,
communications equipment, and data networksÑwired and wireless,
All University telephones, mobile phones, smart phones, storage devices, and personal digital assistants, andAll digital assets owned, managed or leased by the University and any that may be entrusted to the University by otherorganizations (e.g., cloud computing services as well as any other future computing device, service, system, or
application.) 2. Rights and ResponsibilitiesThe use of University computing services is a privilege. Users who have been granted this privilege must use the services in anappropriate, ethical, and lawful manner. Unauthorized access is prohibited and may be monitored and reported to the proper
authorities. The University does not provide a warranty, either expressly or implied, for the computing services provided. The
University reserves the right to limit a computer user's session if there are insu
!cient resources, and to cancel, restart, log,
record, review or hold a job, process, network connection or program to protect or improve system or network performance if
necessary.
The University network is large and complex and supports mission critical functions such as patient care, payroll, academic
classes, Internet access, and electronic mail.  [To ensure the integrity of the network and maximize the availability of network
services, all users connected to the UniversityÕs network must follow IT requirements which can be found
at http://it.unm.edu/network/policy.html
 .Aside from publicly accessible computing resources such as the UNM main campus and branch campus public-access
computers and any University-sanctioned unsecured wireless network, access to all University computing systems must be
authorized by the cognizant department head or designee and in accordance with the terms of 
UAP 2520 (ÒComputer SecurityControls and GuidelinesÓ)
 .2.1. User ResponsibilitiesUsers are responsible for all their activities using computing services and shall respect the intended use of such services.
Whenever a computing facility has speciÞc rules and regulations that govern the use of equipment at that site and users shall
comply with those rules and regulations governing the use of such computing facilities and equipment in addition to any over-
arching University policies such as this one.  [Users must understand and keep up-to-date with this policy and other applicable
University computer policies and procedures.
Users shall respect all copyrights including software copyrights. Users shall not reproduce copyrighted work without the
owner's permission. In accordance with copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the O
!ce of UniversityCounsel, upon receipt of o
!cial notice from a copyright owner, may authorize blocking access to information alleged to be in
violation of another's copyright. If after an investigation information is determined by the O!ce of University Counsel to be inviolation of another's copyright, such information will be deleted from University computing systems.
2.1.1. Copyrights and Software Licenses
Users of University computing resources must comply with copyright law and the terms of licensing agreements, including
software licenses, before accessing or using copyrighted material on the Internet. Users are responsible for determining what
licenses or permissions are necessary and for obtaining such permissions or licenses before using University computing
resources. Purchased music, movies, software, and other multi-media Þles usually include a license that gives you permission
to make copies, change formats or to share the Þle with others. 

Generally, software which the University is not permitted or not licensed to use shall not be installed on University computing
services; however, software which has been personally-acquired is permitted to be installed on University computing services
so long as the user who has installed the software is able to prove s/he is legally permitted to do so. (This is usually done by
retaining and providing the license upon request.)
File-sharing applications often involve the unlawful copying or distribution of copyrighted material without permission orlicense from the copyright owner.  [Anyone who sends or receives Þles using Þle-sharing software may be engaging in an
unlawful act unless (a) the user is the copyright owner or has permission from the copyright owner, (b) the material is in the
public domain, or (c) fair use or another exception to copyright law applies.  [  [  [Upon receipt of information alleging that a user may be engaged in unauthorized Þle sharing of copyrighted material or is in
violation of licensing obligations or other copyright law, the University may, without notice, immediately suspend, block, or
restrict access to an account.  [The University may take such action when it appears necessary in order to protect the security
or integrity of computing resources, or to protect the University from liability. 
Users who violate copyright law or license terms may be denied access to University computing resources, and may be
subject to other sanctions and disciplinary actions, including but not limited to expulsion or discharge from the University.  [  [
In accordance with its legal obligations, the University will continue to develop plans to combat the unauthorized use and
distribution of copyrighted materials, including the possible use of technological deterrents.  [The University will also continue
to provide information on alternatives to illegal Þle-sharing.
  [  [  [ 2.1.2. Site LicensesThe University enters into site license agreements with commercial vendors for campus-wide use of certain software
products.  [The University currently has site licenses for products, including word-processing, spreadsheet, and database
management applications software.  [In addition, many software applications are available at an educational discount through
the UNM Bookstore or other vendors.  [Before buying a particular product, departments should contact the University
Purchasing Department or IT Software Distribution to determine if the University has a site license or volume purchase
discounts for the software in question.  [All users are responsible for adhering to University procurement policies and practices.
2.1.3. Software Developed Internally
University personnel may develop computer programs using University computing resources.  [Such software may be subject
to the UniversityÕs Intellectual Property Policy.
2.1.4. Computer SecurityIndividuals using computing services are responsible for keeping accounts and passwords conÞdential and for safeguarding all
University data and information, especially those covered by state and federal regulations such as FERPA, GLBA, and HIPAA,
regardless if it is being stored on University computing resources, stored on non-University resources, or being transmitted
over communication networks.Unless there is a legitimate University purpose, users shall keep all faculty, student, sta
", and patient personally identiÞableinformation (as deÞned by FERPA, GLBA, PCI, HIPAA, and any other applicable federal or state regulation) conÞdential and
shall not transmit or request to receive such information. Examples of this type of information include social security numbers,
drivers license numbers, birth dates, protected health information within the meaning of HIPAA, and insurance policy
numbers.  [This is not an exhaustive list.  [When in doubt, individuals should the contact the Chief Information O!cer (ordesignee) or the UNM Privacy O!cer.
2.1.5. Computer Accounts and Passwords

The University, through IT and departments, provides computer accounts to authorized users for access to various University
systems.  [These accounts are a means of operator identiÞcation and passwords are used as a security measure.  [An
individualÕs computer account shall not be shared. Account use is a privilege, not a right.
2.1.5.1. Account AuthenticationPasswords, PINs, and other identiÞers authenticate the userÕs identity and match the user to the privileges granted on
University computers, computer networks, systems, and computing resources.  [A password is a security measure designed to
prevent unauthorized persons from logging on with another personÕs computer account and reading or changing data
accessible to that user.  [Users should create passwords carefully and handle them with care and attention.  [Refer
to http://it.unm.edu/accts/faq.html  [for guidance on creating passwords.  [For this security feature to be e
"ective, the user mustprotect the secrecy of his/her password.  [Each user should:
choose a password that is easy to remember but hard to guess,
change his/her password regularly and at any time the user believes the password may have been compromised,
avoid writing the password down, and
not disclose or share the password with anyone.
Similar measures apply to all authentication methods such as PINs.
2.1.5.2 Account Termination and Locking
When an individual leaves the University, his or her account(s) must be locked as soon as reasonably possible and,
subsequently, deleted within a reasonable time. If misuse or theft is detected or suspected, account(s) will be locked according
to the UniversityÕs procedures.
2.1.6. Computer and Data SecurityEveryone at the University shares responsibility for the security of computer equipment, data, information, and computing
resources.
2.1.6.1. Physical SecurityEveryone is responsible for the proper use and protection of University computer resources. Examples of protection measures
include:locking areas after business hours or at other times when not in use;
taking special precautions for high-value, portable equipment;
locking up documents and computing resources when not in use;
 andfollowing University policies for taking computer equipment o" campus (refer to 
UAP 7730 ("Taking University Property O
"Campus") ).2.1.6.2. Information SecuritySecurity of data and information is an essential responsibility of computer system managers and users alike. For example,
users are responsible for:
ensuring the routine backup of their Þles;
using data only for approved University purposes; and
ensuring the security and validity of information transferred from University systems.

UAP 2520 ("Computer Security ControlsÓ)
 should be referred to for speciÞc information security requirements.
2.1.7. Computer Viruses
 and Anti-virus Software
All University departments, though department heads or designees, shall ensure anti-virus software is installed on University
computing resources when technically possible and that the software is active and kept up to date.  [This requirement applies
to all computer servers as well as all desktop and laptop computers.  [This will help ensure that University computing services
and digital assets are not compromised, misused, deleted, or destroyed.
Assistance with virus protection and software is available from IT at 
http://it.unm.edu/.  [3. Unacceptable Computer UseThe University reserves the right to block access to any external electronic resources that are deemed in violation of this
Policy. The University reserves the right to sanction a user pursuant to 
Section 7.  [herein if it is determined, after an
investigation by the appropriate o
!ce, that the user violated federal or state law, rules, or regulations or University policy by
misusing University computing services.  [The University will disclose illegal or unauthorized activities to appropriate University
personnel and/or law enforcement agencies.
3.1. Security Violations
Users shall not:attempt to defeat or circumvent any security measures, controls, accounts, or record-keeping systems;
use computing services to gain unauthorized access to UNMÕs or anyone elseÕs computing services;
intentionally alter, misappropriate, dismantle, disÞgure, disable, or destroy any computing information and/or services;
knowingly distribute malware (i.e., computer viruses, worms, Trojans, or other rogue programs).
3.2. Legal Violations
Users shall not use computing services:for workplace violence of any kind as deÞned in UAP 2210 ("Campus ViolenceÓ)
 ;for unlawful purposes, including fraudulent, threatening, defamatory, harassing, or obscene communications;
to invade the privacy rights of anyone;to disclose student records in violation of FERPA;
to access other computing services (i.e., other UNM computers or computer systems for unauthorized purposes);to access or disclose Þnancial information in violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the UniversityÕs Information
Security Program;
to access or disclose any non-public or personally identiÞable information about a patient, employee, or student withouthaving a legitimate University purpose;to access, use, or disclose protected health information within the meaning of the HIPAA Privacy Rule Regulation or any
applicable state law relating to the conÞdentiality of health information about a patient, employee, or student without having
a legitimate University purpose or in violation of HIPAA and applicable University policies pertaining to HIPAA privacy and
security, except as permitted by University policy and applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations;
 orto violate University policy, state law, or federal law, including but not limited to copyright laws.

3.3. Other MisuseUsers shall not use computing services:in violation of any University contractual obligation, including limitations deÞned in software and other licensing
agreements;
in a way that suggests University endorsement of any commercial product (unless a legal agreement exists and any
communication or computing activity has been pre-approved by an appropriate vice president);
to conceal oneÕs identity when using computing services, except when the option of anonymous access is explicitly
authorized;to possess or distribute obscene or pornographic material unrelated to University instruction, research, or business needs
(students are excluded from this provision);
to masquerade or impersonate another,
by physically or electrically attaching any device to a University computer, communications devices, or wired or wireless
network connection that negatively impacts the performance of any other University computing service;to send chain letters, pyramid schemes, or unauthorized mass mailings;to send non-work or non-class related information to an individual who requests the information not be sent, or
to send commercial or personal advertisements, solicitations, or promotions.
Users should understand that, due to their nature, electronic communications can be intentionally or unintentionally viewed by
others or forwarded to others, and are therefore inherently not private.  [In addition, addressing errors, system malfunctions,
and system management may result in communications being viewed and/or read by other individuals and/or system
administrators.  [IT provides assistance in the proper use of e-mail at 
http://it.unm.edu/email/index.html .In electronic communications, users must state whether they are speaking for themselves or in an o
!cial capacity for theUniversity. Electronic communications that represent the University sent to non UNM addresses must be done in a professional
manner and comply with UAP 1010 ("University External Graphic IdentiÞcation StandardsÓ)
 .4. Incidental Personal UseThe University allows incidental personal use of computing services. Such use must not interfere with an employee fulÞlling his
or her job responsibilities, consume signiÞcant time or resources, interfere with other users' access to resources, be excessive
as determined by management, or otherwise violate any federal or state laws, any individual college or departmental policiesor codes of conduct, or University policies. Each department should document and communicate what use is acceptable.5. Privacy LimitationsUsers of University computing services, including managers, supervisors, and systems administrators shall respect and
protect the privacy of others, in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws, regulations and University policies. 
UAP2520 ("Computer Security ControlsÓ)
 deÞnes the limited conditions under which access to information and Þles can beobtained.  [ Although the University is committed to protecting individual and information privacy, the University cannot
guarantee the security or privacy of correspondence and information stored and transmitted through University computer
networks and systems.  [ Since conÞdential information is often stored on desktop machines, displayed on screens, or printed
on paper that could be in public view, users need to control access by:
using passwords;
turning screens away from public view;

logging out of systems when leaving the work area;
shredding reports containing private information prior to disposal; and
clearing conÞdential information o" desks in public areas.
While the University does not routinely monitor individual usage of its computing services, the normal operation and
maintenance of the UniversityÕs computing services require the backup and storage of data and communications, the logging
of activity, the monitoring of general usage patterns, and other such activities that are necessary for the rendering of
services.  [Similarly, the University does not, in the regular course of business, monitor the content of computing services on its
various networks.  [ However, suspicious aggregate behavior, o
!cial requests from authorities, forensic evaluation or discovery
for purposes of civil litigation, or indications of a security incident, for example, can cause network activities or computingservices to be reviewed.  [ It is the right of the University to monitor and review any activities on its resources.  [It is best,
therefore, to assume that any and all actions taken or activities performed using University computing services are not private.
The University may also access and examine the account (e.g. any and all computer accounts on any University computingresource, e-mail boxes, Þle shares, local or networked storage) of an individual user under the following circumstances and
conditions:if necessary to comply with federal or state law, or
if there is reasonable suspicion that a law or University policy has been violated and the examination of the account is
needed to investigate the apparent violation, or
as part of an investigation involving an administrative claim or charge, arbitration or litigation, or if required to preserve
public health and safety.
Requests for access based on reasonable suspicion must be approved in writing, in advance, by the cognizant vice
president.  [If access to a faculty member's account is being requested, the President of the Faculty Senate must be notiÞed in
conjunction with the request for approval.  [Each request must specify the purpose of access and such access will be limited to
information related to the purpose for which access was granted.  [If such access is being requested by a vice president,
access must be approved by the President.  [If such access is being requested by the President, access must be approved by
the UNM Board of Regents.  [The RegentsÕ Internal Auditing Policy authorizes the University Audit Department full and
unrestricted access to all University records, including but not limited to those contained in computer Þles, discs, and hard
drives.Accessing an employeeÕs computer Þles for work-related, non-investigatory purposes (i.e., to retrieve a Þle or document
needed while the employee who maintains the Þle or document is away from the o
!ce) is permitted and does not require
authorization by a vice president as long as access is limited to the work-related need.  [When an employee separates from the
University, work-related Þles, including but not limited to research data, as well as all records made or kept in any University
electronic medium, remain the property of the University.
Communications and other documents made or kept by means of University computing services are generally subject to New
Mexico's Inspection of Public Records Act to the same extent as they would be if made on paper.  [Therefore, all employees are
urged to use the same discretion and good judgment in creating electronic documents as they would use in creating written
paper documents.6. Reporting Procedures
Suspected violations of this policy (e.g., any incidents involving the unauthorized access to, destruction of, or misuse ofcomputing services by employees, faculty, or students) must be brought to the attention of the cognizant dean, director, or
department head, and the University IT Security O!ce (Security@unm.edu ).  [In the case of a criminal violation, the IT SecurityO!ce will notify UNM Police Department.  [Violations by non-employees will be referred to the appropriate authorities. The
O!ce of University Counsel should be contacted if assistance is needed to identify the appropriate authority.

7. SanctionsThe misuse, unauthorized access to, or destruction of University computing services in violation of applicable laws orUniversity policy may result in sanctions, including but not limited to withdrawal of use privilege; disciplinary action up to and
including expulsion from the University or discharge from a position; and legal prosecution.

*!PURPOSE
 Central Michigan UniversityÕs (CMU)
 Office of Information Technology (OIT)
 has adopted the following 
procedures and guidelines for responding to
 information security incidents and to provide operation detail 
to 
complement the 
INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY. 
 These procedures apply broadly 
to 
all Institutional 
Data, and 
further 
appl
y to all faculty, staff, students and third
-party Agents of the University as 
well as any other CMU affiliate who is authorized to access Institutional Data or CMU networks.
 AUTHORITY
 Execution of these procedures 
will be managed by the Chief Information Security Officer
 (CISO)
 under the 
guidance of the TPC 
and Chief Information Officer
 (CIO) and 
as established by the 
INFORMA
TION SECURITY 
POLICY
. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES 
 The security incident response process incorporates the 
INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
 definitions and 
extends or adds the following roles:
 ¥!The Information Security Office (ISO) 
collectively describe
s the CISO, other OIT employees, other 
CMU staff, or outside contractors who
 conduct the technical work to
 1) gather, preserve, and analyze 
evi
dence and 2) return affected equipment to full operations so that an incident can be 
closed.
 ¥!The 
Incident Commander 
is the ISO employee (or designee) who is responsible for assembling all the 
data pertinent to an incident, communicating with appropriate 
parties, ensuring the information is complete, 
and reporting on incident status both during and after the investigation
 ¥!Law Enforcement 
includes the CMU Police, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and the 
U.S. government agencies that prese
nt warrants or subpoenas for the disclosure of information. Interactions 
with these groups will be coordinated with the Office of General Counsel (ÒOGCÓ).
 ¥!The 
Office of General Counsel
 (OGC)
 for the University acts as the liaison between the ISO and extern
al 
Law Enforcement
 and provides guidance on the extent and form of all responses and disclosures to law 
enforcement and the public.
 ¥!Academic and Business O
fficers 
are the 
CMU leaders
 overseeing significant CMU academic and business 
offices and/or 
designate
d for 
overseeing the 
various regulatory frameworks to which the University is 
required to comply.
  [EVIDENCE PRESERVATION
 The goal of Security Incident Response is to reduce and contain the scope of a security incident and ensure that IT 
assets are returned
 to service as quickly as possible. Rapid response is balanced by the requirement to collect and 
preserve evidence in a manner consistent with the requirements of rules 26
-34 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Discovery
 and to abide by legal and administrative 
requirements for documentation and chain of custody. 
 PHASES OF 
INFORMATION 
SECURITY INCIDE
NT RESPONSE
 OIT
 utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800
-61 as a guide for 
security incident response that encompasses four phases as shown below in Figure 1:
  [
 Figure 1 
Ð Information 
Security Incident Response Phases
 Phase I: 
Preparation
 includes those activities that enable the ISO to respond to a security incident: Policies, tools, 
procedures, effective governance, and communication plans. Preparation also implies that the affected groups have 
instituted the controls necessary to recove
r and continue operations after a security incident is discovered. Post
-mortem analyses from prior incidents 
will 
form the basis for continuous improvement of this phase.
 Phase II: 
Detection and 
Analysis 
includes activities to analyze symptoms that might i
ndicate a 
Security 
Incident, 
and to determine the level of severity for those identified as 
Incidents. 
Initial D
etection
 and A
nalysis 
activities 
will 
focus on determining
 the nature of the Security E
vent.  [The definitions below
 will guide OITÕs actions through 
this 
phase
.  [
 ¥!Security E
vent
 means any unconfirmed or reported concern or complaint related to the inappropriate 
access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the UniversityÕs information, information technologies, or 
informatio
n systems. 
 o!ALL CMU Employees are required to report the theft or exposure of CMUÕs Restricted 
Information
 by the

ticket must be created and assigned to the IT_INFO_SECURITY ticketing group. If the employee 
believes that the security incident is likely to be classified as ÒhighÓ severity based on the above 
descriptions, they must also report it to the
ir supervisor. The CISO or designee will review all 
tickets, determine severity and sensitivity, and assign security incident commanders as appropriate. 
For insider threats, see below for appropriate intake.  [
In the event that investigation into
 Security 
Event 
yields no evidence of a Security 
Incident
 or Breach
, the Ticket will be closed.
  [¥!Security I
ncident
 means any confirmed inappropriate access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the 
UniversityÕs information, information technologies, or information systems, requiring investigation and/or 
significant follow
-up, and/or non
-routine action. Security incidents r
equiring formal breach response are 
escalated to breach status. 
 o!Examples of security incidents include, but are not limited to:
 !!Unauthorized access to data, especially protected or restricted data
 !!Computing device infected with malware
 !!Denial of Service (
DoS) attacks
 !!Reconnaissance activities such as scanning the network for security vulnerabilities
 !!Web site defacement
 
!!Violation of CMU security policy
 o!Security 
Incidents may 
also 
be established by review of sources
, including, but not limited to:
 !!Monitoring
 systems
 !!Reports from CMU staff or outside organizations
 !!Service degradations or outages
  [Detected vulnerabilities will not be classified as incidents. OIT employs tools to scan the CMU 
environment and depending on severity of found vulnerabilities may war
n affected users, disconnect 
affected machines, or apply other mitigations. In the absence of indications of compromise or sensitive data 
exposure, vulnerabilities will be communicated
 and documented,
 and the Information Security Office 
(ÒISOÓ) will pursue
 available technology remedies to reduce risk.
  [¥!Security B
reach
 means any confirmed inappropriate access, misuse, theft, or compromise of the 
UniversityÕs Protected or Restricted data or information technologies requiring formal breach response, 
reporting,
 and/or notification(s)
 (such as those 
required for HIPAA
-related incidents)
. Security Breaches are 
one type of High Severity Security Incidents, as defined below.
  [Because t
he activities 
in the next phase 
- Incident Containment, Eradication, and R
ecovery
- will be managed based 
on the level of severity of the 
Security I
ncident
, that level of severity is assigned during
 the Detection and Analysis 
phase of response
. The level of severity is a measure of its impact on or threat to the operation or integrity of 
the 
institution and its information
, and 
determines the priority for handling the incident, who manages the incident, and 
the timing and extent of the response. 
 OIT recognizes three 
levels of 
Security 
Incident 
severity: 
High, 
Medium, 
and 
Low. ¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
High
 Severity
Ó if any of the following conditions exist:
 o!Threatens to have a significant adverse impact on a large number of systems and/or people, such 
as the entire institution.
 o!Poses a potential large financial risk or legal 
liability to the University
 o!Threatens restricted data, such as the compromise of a server that contains names with social 
security numbers or credit card information.
 o!Adversely impacts, either currently or imminently, a core system or service critical to t
he 
operation of a major portion of the University, such as the learning management system or a major 
portion of the campus network.
 o!Poses a significant and immediate threat to human safety, such as a death
-threat to an individual or 
group.
 o!Has a high proba
bility of propagating to many other systems on and/or off campus and causing 
significant damage or disruption.
 o!Indication that a 
Security Breach 
of protected or restricted data has likely occurred.
 o!Expectations for Response 
to High Severity 
Security 
Incide
nts
: OIT expects response time for 
High Severity Security Incidents to be immediate.  [The Chief Information Security Officer will 
notify and inform the CIO, then, acting in league with the CIO, coordinate the ISOÕs technical 
investigation and recovery from
 the Security Incident, while the CIO will act as Incident 
Commander and convene a steering team to guide CMUÕs response to the Security Incident.  [This 
steering team will include the President, the Provost, the General Counsel, the AVP for University 
Comm
unications, the CISO
, other appropriate business or academic officers
, a
nd, if 
HIPAA
-related, the HIPAA Pr
ivacy and 
Security Officers
.  [A ÒLessons LearnedÓ session and Post
-Incident 
Report are required following each High Severity Security Incident.
  [¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
Medium
 Severity
Ó if any of
 the following conditions exist:
 o!Adversely impacts a moderate number of systems and/or people, such as an individual department, 
unit, or building.
 o!Adversely impacts a non
-core service
 o!Adversely impacts a departmental system or service, such as a departmen
tal file server
 o!Disrupts a building or departmental network.
 o!Has a moderate probability of propagating to other systems on and/or off campus and causing 

moderate damage or disruption
 o!Expectations for Response 
to Medium Severity 
Security 
Incidents
: OIT 
expects to respond to 
Medium Severity Security Incidents within 4 hours.  [The CISO or appropriate OIT Director will 
act as Incident Commander and will convene a steering team consisting of appropriate CMU 
academic and business officers, OITÕs University Co
mmunications Liaison, and appropriate 
members of the ISO to coordinate recovery and response.  [A ÒLessons LearnedÓ and Post
-Incident 
Report are not required unless requested by the CIO or CISO.
  [¥!A Security 
Incident will be considered Ò
Low Severity
Ó if it 
exhibits the following characteristics:
 o!Adversely impacts a very small number of systems or individuals
 o!Disrupts a very small number of network devices or segments
 o!Has little or no risk of propagation or causes only minimal disruption or damage in their 
attempt to 
propagate.
 o!Expectations for Response to Low Severity 
Security 
Incidents
: OIT expects to respond to Low 
Severity Security Incidents within one business day.  [Recovery and response will be managed by 
staff assigned to the affected service(s).  [ A 
ÒLessons LearnedÓ is not required, nor is a Post
-Incident Report.
  [Phase III: 
Containment, Eradication, and R
ecovery 
includes 
two parts 
Ð 1) the technical 
activities that attempt to 
contain the incident, and if necessary, recover from it by restoring any 
affected resources and/or processes
, and 2) 
the administrative activities required to communicate to affected individuals and the public.
 The technical activities 
could lead to the identification of additional indicators of compromise and 
might shift the 
Incident 
back into the 
Detection and 
Analysis phase. These activities include, but are not limited to:
 ¥!Segmenting or disconnecting a device from the network
 ¥!Stopping or shutting down services on a device
 ¥!Restricting access to one or more technology services
 ¥!Confiscating a CMU
-owned device to perform additional analysis or restoration
 ¥!Monitoring of suspicious activity
 ¥!Creating/modifying firewall rules
 ¥!Changing passwords
 ¥!Installing patches
 ¥!Conducting 
Forensics investigations
, including imaging of devices
 ¥!Resto
ring systems and/or processes
  [The administrative activities 
include, but are not limited to:
 ¥!Engaging Beazley
, Marsh,
 or other vendors 
to conduct research into reporting/communication 
requirements, gain access to bulk buys of ID protection services, 
obtain templates for communication
, or 
conduct forensic services.
 ¥!Issuing letters or other communications to affected individuals or organizations.
  [Phase IV: 
Post
-Incident A
ctivity
 includes activities
 (such as the ÒLessons LearnedÓ meetings 
referenced 
above)
 to 
analyze the relevant security incident handling procedures with the goals of improving those processes, and to 
reduce the probability of similar future incidents. Post
-incident reports, where applicable, will be created and 
disseminated during th
is phase. The report should minimally contain the following: A description of the security 
incident, the impact or potential impact of the security incident such as system downtime, the classification of any 
data involved in the security incident, and any 
suggestions for improvement of the security incident response process 
or future mitigation strategies.
  [Response to every incident, regardless of severity, must include review of all 
applicable response metrics
 with suggestions for improvement if appropria
te.
  [
ADDITIONAL 
INCIDENT RESPONSE 
CONSIDERATIONS
 ¥!Escalation
 o!Security Incidents may be escalated at any point in the recovery process based upon new 
developments in the investigation.  [Escalation from Low Severity to 
Medium
 Severity may be 
done unilaterally by the CISO.  [Escalation from Medium Severity to High Severity will be 
recommended to the CIO by the CISO and escalated by the CIO.
 ¥!Interactions with Law Enforcement 
 o!No communications with external law enforcement author
ities may occur without the approval of 
the Office of General Counsel.
 The ISO works with these entities, where authorized by OGC, to 
determine the information requirements and to share the minimum necessary information as 
required for incident response.
 ¥!Communications Plan
 o!Public communications about a Security Incident will be released by University Communications 
or their designee after appropriate conversation with the incident steering committee, or, at 
minimum, the OGC.
  [Should a Security Incident bec
ome a Security Breach or suspected Security 
Breach, both the CISO and CIO should be notified immediately. 
 ¥!Privacy
 o!All incident response procedures will follow the current privacy requirements as set out in 
the
 DATA STEWARDSHIP POLICY
. Exceptions must be approved by OGC.
 ¥!Insider Threats
 o!In the case that the Incident Commander is a person of interest in a security incident:
 !!The Chief Information Security Officer will act in their stead or appoint a designee to act 
on their behalf.
  [o!In the case that the Chief Information Security Officer is a person of interest in a security incident:
 !!The normal intake process should not be use
d. Instead, the security incident should be 
reported directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who will act in their stead or 
appoint a designee to act on their behalf.
 o!In the case that another CMU administrative authority is a person of interest in 
an incident:
 !!The Chief Information Security Officer will work with the remaining administrative 
authorities in the Chief Information Security OfficerÕs reporting line to designate a 
particular point of contact or protocol for communications.

91.004:  [University Credentials
Status:
Approved on August 27, 2015
Signatures and dates 
on archival copy
Effective:
when approved
 Initiated by:
Matthew Dalton
Director of Information Security
 Endorsed by:
Stephen Golding
Vice President for Finance and Administration
 Approved by:
Roderick J. McDavis
President
 OverviewCredentials issued at Ohio university are for the sole purpose of accessing university resources. They
are often the first line of attack, and the last line of defense, in the protection of these resources.
Because of this, they must be used with care, and adequately protected. 
This policy outlines those
protections that must be observed by individuals, technical staff, and systems using credentials at the
university and recommendations for their protection.
A.Individuals
An individual to whom credentials have been issued has certain responsibilities in the care of those
credentials. 
The following behaviors should be observed to reduce the risk of compromise to your
credentials.
B.Keep your credentials, secret questions, and their answers private and known only to you.
1.
Use unique credentials (username and password combination) for Ohio university that are
different from any other service or website.
2.Your credentials are for your personal authentication to university resources, and should not be
used as a means to provision services to other users.
3.If you suspect that your credentials have been compromised, change your credentials and
questions immediately and inform the information security office by e-mail to 
security@ohio.edu
.4.Credentials
Credentials exist to ensure that the individual gaining access to university resources through an account
is the same individual to whom the access was given. 
The university acknowledges that not all accounts
carry the same level of risk. Therefore the level of rigor and complexity requirements that are applied
to ensuring the security of the credentials will be in line with the risk which a compromise of that
account would present to the university or its community.
The university data stewards (see part (D) of policy 
93.001) will review these complexity requirements
on an annual basis. 
Any changes that need to take place between reviews will be identified by the
university information security officer, and presented to the university data stewards for approval.
Actual authentication complexity requirements will be captured in the "Authentication Credentials
Complexity Standard," which strives to relate the strength of the credential with the risk that a
compromise of that account would present to the university.
C.Information system owners
It is the owner or manager of information services' responsibility to ensure that they comply with this
policy and its associated complexity requirements. 
The recommended method is integrating with OIT
authentication services and appropriately mapping individuals' accounts to the correct risk levels. 
Prior
to integrating with OIT authentication services, permission must be obtained from the university
information security officer and the chief information officer or their delegates. 
If a separate user
credential is issued, the service owner must instruct their users to use different credentials than are
used with their OhioID.
D.Authentication servers
University authentication services are limited to those run and maintained by the office of information
technology. 
It is the responsibility of the chief information officer or appointed delegate to ensure that
the following are adhered to by all systems that perform authentication functions.
E.Only those systems that are required and approved by the chief information officer or appointed
delegate may store passwords in any form. 
Those that store these passwords must store them in
a cryptographically secure format.
1.Authentication systems must encrypt password at all times during transmission.
2.Authentication systems must be housed in the university datacenter or another approved
location.
3.Authentication systems must be administered by OIT.
4.
ReviewersProposed revisions of this policy should be reviewed by:
1. University Data Stewards
2. Information System Owners
3. Information Technology Governance Council
4. Information Technology Student Focus Group
5. Classified Senate
6. Administrative Senate
7. Faculty Senate
Forms, References, and History
Authentication systems must be hardened in accordance with NIST 800-123.
5.Administrators accessing authentication systems must use an approved multi-factor
authentication to access.
6.Forms
There are no forms that are specific to this policy.

  [
A. Preamble
 "Ac
ademic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of 
truth, the 
development of students, and the general well
-being of society. Free inquiry and free 
expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals ... The responsibility to secure 

and to respect general conditions conducive to the freedom to learn is shared by all members 

of the academic community. Each college and university has a duty to develop policies and 

procedures which provide and safeguard this freedom."
 - 
Excerpt from the American Association of University Professors (
ﬁAAUP
ﬂ) Joint St
atement on 
Rights and Freedoms of Students
 B. Context
 This document is the basis for university
-wide policies and practices for the acceptable use 
and management of all University of Hawai‚i (
ﬁUHﬂ 
or 
ﬁUniversity
ﬂ) information technology 
resources. It is int
ended to define and provide effective prot
ection, 
equal 
access
, and 
administrative guidelines for the use of those resources. The purpose of these guidelines is not 

to replace but to supplement existing laws, regulations, general codes of conduct, agreemen
ts, 

and contracts that are currently in place.
 In support of its mission of teaching, research, and public service, and within its institutional 

priorities and financial capabilities, the University provides access to computing, network and 

information systems and services for the students, faculty and staff who form the basis of the 

UH community. Collectively, these computing, network and information systems and services 

comprise the institution™s information technology infrastructure. The University strives to create 

an intellectual environment in which its community can effectively access and create 

information and collaborate with colleagues both within the UH system and at other institutions. 

 EP 2.210

  [As it d
oes so, 
the University is committed to maintaining an
 inform
ation environment that is 
free of harassment and discrimination and is accessible to all members of its community. Such 
an environment can only exist when the users and managers of the information technologies 
behave responsibly and respectfully.
 This policy creates the basis for such an environment by outlining the philosophy and general 
principles for appropriate use and management of information technology resources by 

University faculty, staff and students. It applies to all computing, information and network 

systems and services owned
, developed, procured,
 or administered by the University, as well 
as to individual activities that take place over the Internet or other external network 

connections using University systems, connections or user acc
ounts
, in conducting University 
business
. 
Appropriate use of technological resources is framed by the same legal and ethical 

considerations as are applicable to other public resources. Access to UH networks and 

computer systems is a privilege granted subject to existing University policies
, 
as well as all 
applicable local, state, and federal laws
, 
e.g.,
 copyright law, child pornography prohibitions, 
computer crime statutes.
 The University requires that all its students, faculty, staff and approved guests abide by these 

policies. In addition, users of specific technology resources and services that are provided in 

cooperation with larger communities or third parties
, 
e.g.
, 
the Internet, must also adhere to 
codes of conduct which the University accepts implicitly or explicitly on behalf of all its users. 

The University strives to inform all users of these policies, but users are responsible for their 

own actions. The University accepts no responsibility or liability for the specific acts of 

individuals that violate this or any other authorized policy, code of conduct or statute.
 For in
formational purposes, the computer crime statute from Hawai‚i™s penal code is included 
herein as Appendix A and portions of the State Ethics Code are included as Appendix B.
 C. Responsible Use
 1. Privileges and Responsibilities
 The University defines and provides access to institutional computers, information 

systems and networks as a privilege rather than a right. Reliable and safe access to the 

University's information resources requires that users accept their responsibilities to 

behave in ways that protect the community, and by so doing they also preserve their 

own access.
 All users must respect the rights of others, the integrity of the facilities and controls 

which are implemented to maximize the community™s reliable access, and all pertinent 

license and contractual agreements that underlie the University™s technology 

infrastructure. It is the policy of the University to deny access to any member of the user 

 EP 2.210
 Page 
4 
of 17
  [comm
uni
ty who violates thi
s policy or who uses the University™s technology resources to 
violate other duly established policies or laws.
 2. Principles of Responsible Use, with Examples
 All users have the responsibility to operate the University computing systems in an 
eth
ical, lawful and responsible manner. These principles of responsible use are derived 
directly from standards of decency and common sense that apply to the use of any 

shared public resource. They apply equally to users who are students, faculty, staff or 

any authorized guest user of the University™s systems, networks and services. Each of 

the following principles includes examples of prohibited behaviors. These examples are 

intended to illustrate the range of unacceptable actions rather than to exhaustively 

elaborate all specific behaviors that may violate the principle.
 1. Users must adamantly protect their personal passwords
 Passwords are the basic security mechanism which authenticate individuals as 

eligible to use University resources. The username and password also 

authorize individuals to perform specific actions based on the identity of the 

user, such as permitting students to drop classes or faculty to view class lists. 

Unauthorized use of someone else™s password is strictly prohibited, and may 

constitute violation of law and well as standards of conduct.
 Passwords should be chosen that are difficult to guess and should 
not be 
written down. Experts recommend changing passwords on a regular basis. 

Under no circumstances should a password be shared with a family member, 

friend or acquaintance, much less any stranger or caller. Appendix C contains a 

guide to the selection an
d management of personal passwords. Users should 

immediately report any suspected unauthorized use of their username to their 

system administrator.
 2. Users must respect the privacy of others™ passwords, information and 

communication, and may not attempt to use University resources to gain 

unauthorized access to any site or network or to maliciously compromise the 

performance of internal or external systems or networks. Digital environments 

present certain new opportunities for abuse, but the infractions and 

consequences are often comparable to those in the physical world. Just as an 

unlocked door is not an invitation to theft, everything that is technically possible 

is not permissible or legal.
 Users must not store or run programs intended to obtain others™ 
passwords. 
Users must not look over others™ shoulders to try to obtain passwords or 

otherwise try to obtain unauthorized access to the information or 

communication of others. Users may not ﬁsniffﬂ networks or undertake 

comparable measures to obtain access to passwords or other information not 

 EP 2.210
 Page 
5 
of 17
  [ made publicly available by the owner. Users may not attempt to gain 
unauthorized access to other systems, networks and services external to the 

University via the University™s Internet or other network connections. Nor
 may 
programs be stored or executed that attempt to gain unauthorized system
-level 
access to computers or network devices either inside or external to the 

University.
 Users may not store or execute programs or engage in or abet any activities 

designed to test or compromise system or network performance without the 

prior written authorization of the responsible system administrator(s). This 

includes programs that introduce a virus, worm or other destructive/disruptive 

programs. Users may not launch ﬁdenial
-of-serviceﬂ attacks against internal or 
external systems and networks from within the University.
 Violations of this policy may also be subject to prosecution under the federal 

Electronic Communications Privacy Act (
ﬁECPA
ﬂ) of 1986
, as amended,
 which 
prot
ects the confidentiality of personal electronic communications or the Hawai‚i 
Penal Code provisions for computer crime. Under no circumstances will 

excuses be accepted that such behaviors were intended purely for educational 

purposes or to help system administrators improve security.
 3. No individual may falsely represent themselves or "spoof" another physical 

network connection
 Violations of laws, codes of conduct or usage policies are usually attempted 

under false identities. Academic integrity dictates that members of the 

University community be accountable for their actions. Users may not attempt 

to represent their network activities as originating from a network address other 

than the actual source
, 
i.e.
, 
ﬁspoofingﬂ. Nor should users falsely identify 
the
mselves in their email or postings. There are legitimate uses for anonymity 
in certain specific communications forums, but it is generally not considered 

appropriate in most on
- 
line discourse.
 4. Users
 must observe all laws relating to copyright, trademark,
 export and 
intellectual property rights
. 
Intellectual property is the lifeblood of a university, and all members of the 

university community should respect the work of others inside and outside the 

academy. Software may not be duplicated or installed exc
ept in strict 
accordance with applicable licensing agreements. Software not eligible for 

export may not be freely stored on University systems or transmitted outside 

the U.S. And University servers and networks may not be used to house or 

distribute unauth
orized software, music, video or other information resources. 

The University will actively participate in the prosecution of members of the 

 EP 2.210
 Page

 community who violate the law, for example, by mounting illegal music or 
software distribution servers using University resources.
 The University adopts the EDUCOM Code, a statement on Software and 

Intellectual Rights, incorporated herein as Appendix D. EDUCAUSE, which has 

since incorporated EDUCOM and its programs, is a non
-profit consortium of 
colleges and universities committed to the use and management of information

5. User
s must 
ensure that their electronic communications do not infringe the 
rights of others and are conducted in accord with the same standards of 

behavior that apply in other forms of communication
 The privilege of Internet access offers numerous opportunities to interact with 

others all over the world. As an institution of higher education the University 

supports open and unrestricted communication by members of its community. 

However, many people have a tendency to send email, post messages, or 

engage in other behaviors that they would never think to perform in person. 

Electronic communication may lack the visual and verbal cues such as a smile 

or tone
-of-voice that indicate when someone is joking, so misinterpretation may 
be more likely than in
-person. For this reason, it is suggested that people 
exercise even more care in their on
-line communication than face
-to-face.
 The same legal and policy standards that define intimidation, harassment or 

invasion of privacy apply to the electronic environment. For example, 

persistence in sending unwanted email constitutes harassment and is 
unacceptable if not illegal. Display of sexually explicit images or sounds where 

others can see or hear them may create a hostile environment and could 

constitute sexual harassment according to University policies on sexual 

harassment. And obscene email is comparable to obscene phone calls or 

letters.
 Laws relating to child pornography, obscenity and defamation apply in 
electronic environments and the University 
strictly prohibits the use of
 its 
information technology
 resources for downloading pornography or other such 

 EP 2.210

  [ill
egal
 conduct.  [The University will w
illingly cooperate in the prosecution of 
individuals formally charged with such offenses.
 Finally, users should be aware that each speci
fic on
-line forum or mailing list 
might have specific standards of content and behavior to which its members 
are expected to adhere. These may range from ﬁno anonymous messagesﬂ to 

ﬁno posting of job ads on this mailing list.ﬂ The University will cooperate
 in 
helping the managers of external forums enforce their standards, just as we 

expect other institutions to cooperate in helping members of the UH community 

manage their forums based on the public standards of behavior established for 

their group.
 6. University resources are intended to be used for institutional purposes and may 

not be used for private gain.
 The University provides information technology resources at great expense for 

the purpose of supporting its mission (learning, teaching, research, and public 

service). It is expected that usage will be primarily educational in nature in 

support of this mission.
 All applicable laws and policies relating to the ethical use of public resources 

apply to University information technologies as well. The
 Hawai‚i State Ethics 
Code prohibits use of University resources for private business purposes (see 

Appendix B) and under no circumstances may individuals use institutional 

technology resources for commercial purposes without prior written 

authorization. T
his includes activities such as the use of University email or 
web sites for marketing a home business, hosting a commercial home page, or 

providing friends who are not members of the University community with 

access to institutional equipment and services. Users may not run private 

servers or bulletin board systems for non
-University purposes through 
University networks or provide such connectivity to others. Political 

campaigning may not be engaged in using the University™s electronic 

information systems
 7. Users may not engage in activities which compromise institutional systems or 

network performance for others
 The University administers its technology resources on a shared
-use basis for 
the benefit of the entire community. This is only possible when all 
members of 

the community respect the need of others for services. In addition, portions of 

the Internet itself may be vulnerable to disruptions in service by malicious 

activities. As a whole, the Internet protects itself through an informal and 

evolving code of behavior among system administrators. The University of 

Hawaii is committed to be a good institutional citizen of the Internet, noting that 

non-cooperating institutions are sometimes blacklisted from certain services 

 EP 2.210
 Page 
8 
of 17
  [ whic
h could prevent members of the Universi
ty community from achieving their 
legitimate academic requirements.
 As a general rule, the University tries to be permissive rather than prohibitive in 
these matters, but certain behaviors by individuals can compromise the 

availability and reliability of services for the entire community. Examples of 

such activities include the unauthorized running of ﬁserverﬂ programs on 

institutional systems or hosting non
-educational web sites intended to do 
nothing more than generate high ﬁhit counts.ﬂ Nothing in this section is intended 

to discourage faculty or staff from operating authorized servers in a responsible 

manner in support of the mission of the University. While it attempts to manage 

resources on a content
-neutral basis, the University does reserve the right to 
curtail specific uses of its technology infrastructure that unduly interfere with the 

institution™s ability to provide the best possible service to the overall community.
 Users may not engage in the transmission of unsolicited bulk email 

(ﬁspammingﬂ), regardless of how important it may seem to the sender. Email is 

a form of individual communication, not a public forum, and should not be used 

to express opinions or forward views to those who have not expressed a wish 

to engage in the dialog. This policy shall in no way limit the use of email as a 

legitimate means for the University community to share information and 

communication.
 Under no circumstances may users create, transmit or forward electronic chain 

letters. Chain letters are often social notes, wishes of good fortune or most 

insidiously, bogus virus warnings which request the recipient to forward the 

message to friends and colleagues ad infinitum. Such notes can have a 

significant and consequential impact on institutional resources as
 they are 
forwarded around University systems. Users may not initiate or participate in 

the targeting of a particular person or system with mass quantities of email 

("mail bombsﬂ). In the paper world junk mailers bear the full costs of such 

activities when
 they choose to buy a stamp and envelope, but with University 
email the costs are borne by the entire community and the taxpayers of the 

State.
 Activities such as spam, chain letters, and mail bombs degrade performance of 

networks and systems, may violate
 agreements with third parties such as the 
University™s Internet Service Providers, and may even endanger the availability 

of the email services for the entire institution. Violations may be cause for the 

revocation of the offender™s access to University r
esources.
 D. Confidentiality and Security of Electronic Information
 The University strives to maximize the confidentiality and security of its information systems 

and services within the limitations of available resources. As with paper
-based systems, no 

 EP 2.210
 Page 
9 
of 17
  [techn
olog
y can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. All users should be aware of this fact and 
should not have a
n expectation of total privacy regarding information that is created, stored, 
sent or received on any networked system. The most important first line of defense in 
information security is the password, and it is for that reason that the University username and 

password must be adamantly protected as described above. And institutional custodians of 

private information should exercise prudence, using se
cure technologies when appropriate and 

feasible.
 The Internet environment offers tremendous opportunities to provide convenient access to 

University information and services to authorized individuals wherever they may be. Users who 

serve as custodians of institutional information should be particularly aware of the potential for 

unauthorized access to or tampering with on
-line information and services in the Internet 
environment. Techniques such as the use of encryption, secure web servers or restricting 

access based on specific criteria may be appropriate based on the balance between access 
and security applicable to any specific application or service. Technology administrators are 

responsible to provide reasonable measures of protection of the underlying
 technology 
systems and infrastructure they manage. But risk assessment and risk management strategies 

are the responsibility of the functional custodians of specific information and services, in 

consultation with technology managers who should describe the specific technical safeguards 

in place.
 E. Ownership and Disclosure of Information
 The University owns the computers and networks that comprise the institutional information 

technology infrastructure. The electronic allocation of file space to a user does
 not assign legal 
ownership of the content. Rather, it is the granting of permission to use these institutional 

facilities subject to the policies and regulations of the University and applicable statutes. 

Collective bargaining agreements and related University policies govern ownership of 

intellectual property.
 Files stored on University systems may be subject to disclosure under the U.S. Freedom of 

Information Act or the Hawai‚i Uniform Information Practices Act. In addition, it is the policy of 

the University to cooperate with all legally empowered investigations initiated by law 

enforcement agencies when presented with a legitimate court order such as a warrant or 

subpoena. As has been made abundantly clear in highly publicized legal cases, this may 

inc
lude archives of electronic mail sent or received. In addition, the contents of files on 
University systems may be inspected in the context of a duly authorized University 

investigation.
 Users should be aware that most institutional systems are backed up on a routine basis to 

ensure the ability to recover from computer or network failures or disturbances. Backup 

procedures are generally not designed or intended for long
-term storage of files. However, all 
users should be aware that files or email messages 
that they have deleted may still persist on 
backups and may therefore be subject to disclosure in a duly authorized investigation.

17  [ F. Privacy of Student Information
 University computing, information and network resources must be used in a manner consistent 
with appropriate rules and laws governing the individual privacy of students. This includes the 

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (
ﬁFERPA
ﬂ) (codified in 20 U.S.C., section 1231g) as 
amended; Hawai‚i Revised Statutes, Chapter 708

 G. Commitment to Access
 The University is committed to a policy of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination 
on the basis 
of disability
 status. 
Therefore, these policies and procedures e
nsure that Individuals
 with 
Disabilities
, will not, on the basis of those disabilities, be denied equal access to
 the 
University™s programs
, services, and activities. All University 
units 
are responsible for ensuring 
that 
the 
services, programs and activities they provide via information technology
 resources 
and digital media are
 as accessible
, effective
, and timely

are to people without disabilities
. 
Each individual or unit responsible for web content must 
be 
aware of this
 Policy and 
know 
how to provide accessible content. Those responsible must
 also 
monitor and evaluate the
 content regularly for acces
sibility.
 The University 
is committed to
 ensur
ing
 equal opportunity for Individuals with D
isabilities in 
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (
ﬁADA
ﬂ)
, as amended by the ADA 
Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitati
on Act of 1973
, which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of disability in employment or in the provision of educational 

services 
as well 
as the Higher Education Opportunity Act
. 
This policy applies to all
 information technology

addition,
 this Policy 
applies to all information technology resources
 and digital media
 used to conduct 
university business, except information technology resources
 created or published by 
students,

  [
All web content should be in compliance with Section 508 Standards and should also meet 
the 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level 
AA. Additional standards for other

  [Rights and Responsibilities
 1. Information Technology Services (ﬁ
ITS
ﬂ) ITS recognizes the responsibility to identify and maintain the academic and 

technical standards that are fundamental to providing quality resources while 

ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities. To meet this obligation, ITS:
 a. Has the responsibility to ensure that all of its resources, viewed in 
their 

entirety, are accessible;
 b. Has the right to select among equally effective methods of 

accommodating Individuals
 with 
Disabilities;
 c. Has the right to refer 
Individuals
 with 
Disabilities to the appropriate agency 
with requests for accommodations that exceed those currently possible at 

ITS;
 d. Has the right to deny a request for services for 
Individuals
 with 
Disabilities. 
If a request is denied, ITS has the responsibility to inform the individual of 

the reasons for the denial.
 2. Individuals
 with Disabilities
 Individuals
 with 
Disabilities have the right to an equal opportunity to use and 
benefit from the resources that ITS has to offer.  [To ensure this right, 

Individuals 
with 
Disabilities:
 a. Have the responsibility to identify themselves as needing appropriate, 

reasonable accommodations;
 b. Have the responsibility for making their needs known in a timely manner;
 c. 
Have the same obligation as any other UH faculty, staff, or student to 

comply with 
University 
policy and procedures;
 
 EP 2.210

ard 
UH policies and procedures;
 e. Have the right to confidentiality of all information regarding their disability.  [
Individuals
 with 
Disabilities have the right to choose to who information 
about their disability will be disclosed.
 In addition to the provisions contained herein, separate guidelines shall be established 

concerning 
accessible technology and dig
ital media
 and procurement of 
information 
technology
 goods and services.
 H. Special Responsibilities of System and Network Administrators
 Administrators 
of information technology bear a heavy responsibility to maximize the 
availability and utility of the systems they manage while at the same time honoring individual 

users™ justifiable expectations of an information and communications environment that is ﬁs
afeﬂ 
for its users. In addition to having all the responsibilities of any other user as described above, 

system administrators are granted certain system privileges which make it possible for them to 

manage the technical resources under their control. System privileges may permit access to 

initial passwords, files, voice mail, telephone or electronic communication, and information 

about individual usage patterns. These privileges are necessary for doing their jobs, but have 

tremendous potential for abuse as
 well. Such abuse is a violation of University policy and this 
section outlines the unique responsibilities and obligations of system and network 

administrators.
 These special responsibilities accompany the granting of any network or system privileges to 

any member of the University community, whether faculty, student or staff. System 

administrators to whom this applies include individuals who administer departmental, college 

or institutional servers; individuals who administer network devices such as mode
ms and 
routers; individuals responsible for telephone services; and individuals who have any level of 

privileged access to institutional information systems. Under no circumstances will abuse of 

system privileges be tolerated and violations will be conside
red as legitimate cause for 

disciplinary action up to and including termination and/or legal prosecution. Individuals who are 

not willing to accept these responsibilities should not be in positions which require system 

privileges in order to perform their 
duties.
 In addition, individual systems and servers can be carelessly mismanaged not only to the 

detriment of the users of that system or service but to the detriment of the entire institution. 

Before making the decision to install a server, the responsible administrator should be 

prepared to commit the time and resources necessary to ensure proper management. This 

includes designation of a professional system administrator who will have the time and 

expertise to understand the technical implications of th
eir systems, maintain current on 
vulnerabilities, software patches and new releases, and be able to address urgent issues on 

an immediate basis. Failure to do so may endanger not only the integrity of services provided 

to one™s own users but to the institution as a whole. The University will not hesitate to 

disconnect improperly managed systems that endanger the integrity of institutional networks, 

 EP 2.210

tem
s or services and it will be the sole responsibility of the unit™s system administrator or its 
managemen
t to remedy the situation.
 While the following list is not considered to be all
-inclusive, it establishes the framework for 
unacceptable behaviors. University management has the responsibility to ensure that system 
administrators within their units address these matters and should not permit the establishment 

of servers and services within their units unless they understand the potential for abuse and 

accept responsibility for compliance. And users should be welcomed to discuss any or all of 

these matters with their system administrators. All perceived violations of these guidelines 

should be reported to the appropriate dean, director, provost or vice
-president.
 1. System administrators shall protect individual passwords
 Users have the right to expect that their passwords be treated with complete 

confidentiality. Passwords should never be divulged to a third party except as necessary 

in the course of distributing a new password to a user. System administrators should 

take the utmost care in how passwords are distributed, striving for the best possible 

balance between a user™s needs for privacy and convenience. Any time a password is 

transmitted to a user
, 
the user should be advised to change their password immediately 
to protect against any possible disclosure
 during the transmission.
 2. System administrators shall not browse, inspect or copy users™ information
 System administrators may not browse the contents of user files or messages 
-- 
whether on
-line or from backups 
-- without the user™s permission. Inspection of 
information is permitted only upon specific authorization from a dean, director, provost, 

vice
-president or legal authorities as part of a duly authorized investigation or for official 
University business. As a matter of professionalism, system admin
istrators should avoid 

direct or indirect contact with users™ information and communication content whenever 

possible. In spite of their best efforts system administrators may from time
-to-time 
encounter confidential information in the performance of their
 duties. Under no 
circumstances should such information be acted upon, divulged, or used for the 

personal benefit or profit of anyone. Violations of this trust endanger the viability of the 

institutional information infrastructure and will not be permitted. However, system 

administrators may perform routine scans and are encouraged to utilize standard 

security tools to check for potentially damaging or illegal software on institutional 

systems. 
3. System and network administrators shall not routinely collect 
information on individuals™ 

information usage patterns
 The University expects that the members of its community will access a rich variety of 

information and communication resources in the course of their academic activities. 

System administrators shall not monitor or collect data regarding the activities of 

individuals unless specifically authorized to do in the context of a duly authorized 

 EP 2.210
 Page 14
 of 
17  [ investigation. This is not intended to interfere with the responsibility of system 
administrators to collect and analyze general anonymous information about the overall 

patterns of usage of information technology resources. Such information is a vital tool in 

ensuring the adequacy of the institutional technology environment to meet the needs of 

its users. Nor are system
 administrators obliged to spend undue efforts disabling the 
routine logging activities that are built into many server operating systems.
 4. System administrators shall configure software systems so as to maximize the 

confidentiality of user communication
 Administrators of email servers in particular bear a responsibility to respect the privacy 

of their users™ communication. Email systems should be configured so as to maximize 

privacy. For example, email that is rejected for technical reasons should be returned to 

the sender rather than to the ﬁpostmaster.ﬂ And routine error notification messages to 

the postmaster should contain only message headers, not the message contents. Users 

are encouraged to ask their email administrator how email systems are configured and 

under what circumstance their email may be disclosed.
 5. System administrators shall configure systems to enforce appropriate password policies
 Most server operating systems have configurable options for password security. 
System 
administrators should use these options to comply with the UH password policy in 

Appendix C. In addition, system administrators should ensure that all activities relating 

to security changes are handled in accord with a written policy and are documented 

(e.g., system privile
ges should not be given to individuals who do not need them to 
perform their job, and the granting of such privileges should be documented
). Procedures should be in place for emergency access to critical passwords needed in 

case of system failure when the usual system administrator(s) may not be available. 

The level of formality and detail of the security policy and practices may be dependent 

on the role and importance of specific systems and services.
 6. System administrators shall stay abreast of any vulnerabilities of their systems and 

manage security in accord with appropriate recommendations
 System administrators are responsible for remaining up
-to-date at all times with security 
issues relevant to the systems they administer. This may be done through means such 

as their vendors™ information channels or Computer Emergency Response Team 

(ﬁ
CERT
ﬂ) bulletins. System administrators are required to use this information to apply 
all recommended security patches in a timely manner.
 7. System administrators should c
onfigure their systems to minimize the chance for abuse, 
and act promptly to end abuses upon notification
 Certain kinds of disruptions rely on the naiveté of system administrators on the Internet. 

Any perception that the University is a haven for such abusers endangers the ability of 

 EP 2.210
 Page 15
 of 
17  [the Univ
ers
ity community to communicate with others. For example, external sites that 
have been attack
ed by someone using a University system as the instrument of the 
attack may find that they can only safeguard themselves by blocking all traffic from the 
University. As just two examples of the kinds of measures that should be taken, email 

administrators should block anonymous email relays through their systems and network 

administrators should block the forging of IP source addresses from within networks 

they manage. As noted above, the University will not hesitate to disconnect improperly 

managed systems that endanger the integrity of institutional networks, systems or 

services and it will be the sole responsibility of the uni
t™s system administrator or its 
management to remedy the situation.
 8. System administrators shall publicize backup policy
 As noted above, backups present a means by which information may be recovered that 

users believe to have been deleted. Backup policies
 determine the persistence of 
deleted information and therefore users have a right to know the backup policy of all 

systems they use. System administrators should post this policy or make it easily 

available to their users upon request.
 I. Due Process
 All alleged violations of this policy shall be processed according to the principles of due 

process, for example, allegations should always be investigated by a party other than the 

accuser. It is the policy of the University to avoid creating unnecessary 
enforcement 

mechanisms for technology that are different than for other media. Therefore, the authority that 

would be responsible for comparable infractions shall also be responsible for enforcing 

violations that take place via technology 
(e.g., if sexual 
harassment occurs via technology, 
responsibility for enforcement shall reside with the same authority that would handle any other 

sexual harassment allegation
). 
In general, when an alleged violation of this policy by a user is encountered, the responsible
 staff or system administrator shall first notify the user. The user will be expected to take 

immediate remedial action or respond by indicating that they do not believe they have violated 

the policy. Depending on the seriousness of the alleged violation, or should the violation 

persist after notification to the user, further investigation and consequent enforcement action 

may be initiated.
 Allegations of violation of statute or conduct codes will be filed with appropriate internal or 

external authorities,
 typically the Dean of Students, Vice President, or legal authorities. If the 
allegation relates to personal harassment the system administrator should direct the 

complainant to file their allegation with the responsible authority. System administrators wi
ll 
cooperate fully in duly authorized investigations and should attempt to provide assistance to 

aggrieved parties. But 
System administrators are not obligated to file personal complaints on 
behalf of aggrieved parties since that decision belongs with the 
complainant.
 
 EP 2.210
 Page 16
 of 
17  [In c
ases where the alleged violation relates to endangering the availability or performance of 
the tec
hnology infrastructure (e.g.
, 
a denial
-of-service attack), authority for investigation and 
action up to and including suspension of access t
o University technology resources may be 
delegated to the senior manager responsible for the impacted technology. Inspection of user 
files necessary to the investigation should be approved in advance by a Dean, Director, 

Chancellor or Vice P
resident. If ac
cess to University technology is suspended as a result of the 
investigation, the alleged violator may appeal their suspension to the appropriate 
Chancellor, 

Dean, D
irector
 or Vice President
. Such violations may also be referred to appropriate internal 
or e
xternal authorities or for prosecution as a criminal offense or violation of other code of 
conduct.
 Allegations of misconduct by system administrators should be filed with the responsible Dean, 

Director, 
Chancellor 
or 
Vice 
President, who shall be responsi
ble for investigating the situation 
by drawing on expertise outside the unit as needed.
 Any and all discipline or appropriate disciplinary actions will be imposed in accordance with the 

applicable collective bargaining agreements.  [For all included employees covered by collective 

bargaining, appeals of disciplinary actions shall be filed in accordance with the applicable 

collective bargaining agreement.
 Regardless of its commitment to due process, the University reserves the right to summarily 

suspend access to facilities and services or take emergency actions as necessary to protect 

the safety, integrity and performance of its institutional systems and services. Such actions 

may be necessary due to inadvertent errors or problems unrelated to misconduct by
 any 
individual, but system administrators must be able to take certain actions in times of crisis to 

preserve and protect the overall services provided to the University community.

2.8 Other Registered Entities
 
Any entity that is a registered user and connected to the university network is responsible for the 
security of its computers and network devices and is subject to the following:
 

 
The 
provisions of the IT Security policy and the standards, procedures, and guidelines established 
by IT Services for university computing and network facilities.
 

 
All other laws, regulations, or policies directed at the organization and its individual users.
 
3. Risk Assessment
 
Risk assessment is a systematic process used in determining potential for and impact of a negative 
event by evaluating the nature of the information and information systems.
 
All information systems must meet the
 
Minimum Security Standard
s for Protected 
Information
 
based on the
 
Data Classification policy
 
(see Resources below)
. Some selected 
systems will be designated for conducting a risk assessment at a prescribed frequency in the 
Schedule of Risk Assessments for Information Security (see
 
Resources below). These selected 
systems will have the documented findings and any future actions placed on file for audit and 
accountability purposes.
 

4. Data Protection Requirements
 
Data is a valuable asset of the university, and some data must be prote
cted with a higher level of 
attention and caution. The level of protection is based on the method defined by the
 
Data 
Classification policy
 
along with the
 
Minimum Security Standards for Protected Data
 
(see 
Resources below)
.
 
5. Reporting of Security Inciden
ts
 
A critical component of security is to address security breaches promptly and with the appropriate 
level of action. All individuals are responsible for reporting incidents in which they suspect data, 
computer or network security may have been compromise
d. The IT Security Incident Reporting 
policy (see Resources below) outlines the responsibilities of colleges, departments, units, and 
individuals in reporting as well as defining procedures for handling security incidents.

Policies of Colorado State University
University Policy
Policy Title: Acceptable Use for Computing and Networking
ResourcesCategory: InformationTechnology
Owner: Vice President for Information Technology
Policy ID#: 4-1018-001
Contact:Academic Computing and Networking Services Web: 
http://www.acns.colostate.edu
Phone: 970-491-5133Original Effective Date:
10/7/2009Last Revision: 5/26/2016
PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY
Computing and data systems, equipment and services at Colorado State University are
valuable and limited resources that serve a large number and variety of Users. Misuse
of these resources can result in loss of integrity, functionality, speed, bandwidth and
reliability of the UniversityÕs information systems, as well as violations of other laws
and policies (such as those concerning conßicts of interest). The purpose of this policyis to establish what constitutes acceptable use of these resources in order to assurethat they are available to everyone as needed for the UniversityÕs business needs.
APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY
This policy applies to all students, faculty and staff, afÞliates, and all other persons and
organizational units having access to use the UniversityÕs technology and information
systems (hereinafter ÒUsersÓ).DEFINITIONS USED IN THIS POLICY
"Resources" include, but are not limited to, University technology devices, servers,
networks, storage devices and systems (including cloud storage), data, applications,
installed software, and system credentials.POLICY STATEMENT
All Users have the responsibility to make use of the Resources in an efÞcient, ethical,
and legal manner. The Resources are meant to be used in a manner consistent with the

instructional, research, and administrative objectives of the University community in
general and with the purposes for which such Resources were provided. Access to the
Resources is a privilege and imposes upon Users certain responsibilities andobligations, as further described in this policy.
POLICY PROVISIONS
Access to the Resources is granted subject to CSU System and university policies and
local, state, and federal laws. Acceptable use is always ethical, reßects academic
honesty, and shows restraint in the consumption of shared Resources. It demonstrates
respect for intellectual property, protection of sensitive information, ownership of
data, copyright laws, system security mechanisms, and an individualÕs rights to privacy
and to freedom from intimidation and harassment. Activities inconsistent with these
objectives are considered to be inappropriate and may jeopardize continued use of the
Resources. The University will take action it deems necessary to protect the Resources
from systems and events that threaten or degrade operations.
In consideration of being allowed to use the Resources, each User acknowledges and
agrees to the following statements:a. I will not use the Resources for any illegal activity or for any activity prohibited by
this policy or the other policies referenced herein.b. I will not use the Resources to infringe upon any copyright or other intellectual
property rights of another. This pertains to all copyrighted material, including, but
not limited to, written works, recorded music, photographs, video and software. I
understand that I may be held personally liable for copyright infringement. (See
References below for more information on copyright laws and policies).
c. I understand that I am responsible for my own misuse of the Resources, and misuse
by others that I knowingly permit or enable (for example, by sharing my password). I
agree to be responsible for all claims arising from my misuse of the Resources and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Board of Governors and the University from
any costs, expenses or liabilities that might be asserted or imposed upon it or any of
its ofÞcers, agents or afÞliates as a result of such misuse.d. I will avoid any action that interferes with the efÞcient operation of the Resources
or impedes the ßow of information necessary for academic or administrative
operations of the University, and will immediately discontinue such activities once I
become aware of its effects.

e. I will protect the Resources from unauthorized use and acknowledge that I amresponsible for reasonably securing the Resources that have been assigned to me,
including implementing such measures as outlined within the UniversityÕs IT
Security Policy and any related procedures and guidelines, as well as in federal and
state regulations that may apply (such as FERPA or HIPAA). This also includes
applying, in a timely manner, operating system and software patches, and
implementing malware scanning that protects my computing device from
unauthorized access. (Reference: IT Security Policy).
f. 
I will only use the Resources for their intended purposes. I will only accessResources that have been authorized for my use, or which are publically available.
g. I understand that the University retains all ownership rights to all its collective data.
I acknowledge that, unless speciÞcally authorized by a University ofÞcial, copying
University data to a personal device, storage location or any other
media/network/resource which is beyond the UniversityÕs direct control is
prohibited.h. I understand that incidental personal use of Resources (such as email, Internetaccess, fax machines, printers, and copiers) is permitted only when it conforms tothis policy. ÒIncidental useÓ is use that is infrequent, does not interfere with the
normal performance of my duties or the duties of another, and does not unduly
delay othersÕ use or cause the university to incur costs. Such use is restricted to
approved Users only and does not include family members or others not afÞliated
with the University.
i. Storage of personal email messages, voice messages, Þles and documents on the
UniversityÕs Resources must be nominal so as not to burden the universityÕs servers
and other storage devices.
Examples of Inappropriate Conduct Using University Resources
Conduct which violates this policy includes, but is not limited to:a. Accessing another person's computer, computer account, Þles, or data without
permission.b. Giving my username and password to someone else, even temporarily.
c. Using the campus network to gain unauthorized access to any computer system.
d. Using any means to decode or otherwise obtain restricted passwords or access
control information.e. Attempting to circumvent or subvert system or network security measures.
Examples include creating or running programs that are designed to identify

security loopholes, to decrypt intentionally secured data, or to gain unauthorizedaccess to any system.
f. 
Engaging in any activity that might be purposefully harmful to systems or to any
information stored thereon, such as creating or propagating viruses, disruptingservices, damaging Þles or making unauthorized modiÞcations to university data.
g. Performing any act, intentionally or otherwise, that will interfere with the normal
operation of computers, peripherals, or networks.
h. Making or using illegal copies of copyrighted software, storing such copies on
university systems, or transmitting them over university networks.
i. Harassing or intimidating others via email, social media, news groups or Web pages
or any other of the Resources.
j. Initiating or propagating electronic chain letters.k. Initiating or facilitating in any way mass unsolicited or unofÞcial electronic mailing
(e.g., "spamming", "ßooding", or "bombing.").
l. Forging the identity of a User or Resource in an electronic communication.
m. Saturating network or a Resource to the exclusion of another's use, for example,

The University considers violations of acceptable use principles or guidelines to be
serious offenses. The University will take such action it deems necessary to copy and
examine any Þles or information resident on university systems allegedly related to
unacceptable use, and to protect its network from systems and events that threaten or
degrade operations. Violations may be referred to the appropriate University entity
for discipline.
In the case of major infractions, for example those that impair others' ability to use
networking and computing resources, or whenever necessary to protect Resources,
the University may immediately restrict systems or network access as it deems
necessary to mitigate such activities.REFERENCES

!!!1!IT APPROPRIATE USE POLICY
 Summary/Purpose:
 This policy sets forth the privileges of and restrictions on students, faculty, 
staff, and other users with respect to the computing and telecommunications systems 
offered by
 the University of Mississippi
 (UM
). This 
is not limited to desktop/laptop 
system
s, hand
-held
/mobile
 computers, lab facilities, centralized servers, classroom technology, the wired and 
wireless campus networks, 
cloud
-based services, 
etc. This policy define
s and give
s examples of 
various sorts of activities which are detrimental to the welfare of the overall community and 
which are therefore prohibited. It also describes the process by which violators are identified, 
investigated, and disciplined. It should 
be noted that 
certain legal 
activities are in violation of this 
policy and are prohibited with respect to University computing and network systems. This policy 
is designed to protect the University community from illegal or damaging actions by individuals,
 either knowingly or unknowingly. Inappropriate use exposes the University to risks
, including 
virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services
, legal 
issues, and possible financial 
penalties
. This policy directly addresses copyright issues relate
d to illegal downloads
 and 
peer
-to-peer
 file sharing. 
 PLEDGE TO STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STAFF The University of Mississippi is committed to maintaining its leadership position in the use of 
computer and communication technolog
ies to facilitate learning. The University promises to 
provide, as rapidly and as economically as is feasible, the following: 
 ¥!to students,
 access to their information anywhere on campus. 
 ¥!to faculty,
 the resources necessary to enhance teaching, learning and 
research. 
 ¥!to staff,
 the tools necessary for a responsive service environment. 
 The University will normally respect privacy and attempt to safeguard information but cannot 
guarantee these privileges absolutely: 
the University can examine, at any time, any
thing that 
is stored on or transmitted by University
-owned equipment.
  [The University reserves the right to limit access to its networks when applicable university 
policies or codes, contractual obligations, or state or federal laws are violated but does n
ot 
monitor or generally restrict the content of material transported across those networks. 
 The University reserves the right to remove or limit access to material posted on 
university
-owned computers when applicable university policies or codes, contractual obligations, or state 
or federal laws are violated, but does not monitor the content of material posted on university
-owned computers. 
 RESPONSIBLE USE OF 
EMAIL
 AND OTHER E
LECTRONIC COLLABORATION 
MEDIUMS
  [UM recognizes the utilization of electronic communications as an efficient and necessary 
method of conducting business and advanc
ing its mission of creating and disseminating
 knowledge. 
 Electronic mail (
email) and electron
ic collaboration tool
s should be used with the 
same care and discretion as any other type of official university communication
.  [ 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!2!Principal Priorities of 
Email: 1.!Official 
UM email correspondence 
must originate from
 a UM email account
 on the UM 
Mail (
Office
 365) server
s or a registered, on
-campus
, or cloud based
 departmental
 email server.
  [Exceptions include email to support instructional activities, which may originate 
from UM Gmail, and extenuating circumstances where access to UM email a
ccounts is 
limited.  [ 2.!Official UM email correspondence must be concise, professional, and free of personal 
expressions inappropriate for a business or academic environment.
 3.!Email communications must not be unethical, fraudulent, harassing, obscene, or 
perceived to be a confl
ict of interest or contain sensitive/confidential information (i.e. 
credit card numbers, 
social security numbers, etc.) as defined by the IT Security Policy.
 4.!File attachments sent via email must be scanned using current anti
-virus software prior to 
sending
 the transmission. Any file attachment that is received must be scanned prior to 
opening the file.  [
 5.!Users must not allow anyone else to send email using their accounts.
  [UNIVERSITY
-OWNED
 computer and network resources, including Internet connections and 
bandwidth, exist to advance the mission of the University. The University will manage these 
resources accordingly. Technologies such as Internet2 are provided for specific purposes. The 
primary goals of Internet2 are to create a 
leading
-edge
 network capability for the national 
research community, to enable revolutionary Internet applications, and to ensure the rapid 
transfer of new network services and applications to the broader Internet co
mmunity (see 
internet2.edu). The University authorizes the IT
 department
 to create and enforce appropriate 
management policies that are supportive of the goals of these technologies.
 Examples
: The University reserves the right to send official notices to a
ll student/faculty/staff email accounts. Campus webmasters should use discretion when 
linking to non
-University websites. You may not install software on University
-owned 
computers that interferes with day
-to-day work or hinders the professional operation 
of University computers or networks. You may not set up a networked server on campus 
that results in the monopolization of network bandwidth or interferes with access to 
online academic resources. 
 University resources include technology provided to the un
iversity and owned/operated by a 
third 
party
 (cellphones, cellular hotspots, etc.) the use
rs of which must adhere to university 
policies.
  [Technology provided to you by the University is for completing work efficiently and effectively 
and should not be shar
ed except for university
-related purposes.
  [ Any personal use, intentional 
or unintentional, that incurs a cost to the University must be reimbursed. 
 Visitors to the university may use wired and wireless networks and technology configured for 
public access as long as they follow this IT Appropriate Use Policy.
  [ University employees may 
authorize their guests to use the wireless network.
  [In these insta
nces, the employee who 
authorizes the access is responsible for the actions of the guest. 
 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!3!Individual departments may place additional restrictions on personal use of the resources by their 
employees.
 YOU MAY NOT
 use personal email accounts 
to conduct 
official UM
 business. 
 Examples
: Personal email accounts include, but are not limited to, accounts such as 
username@gmail.com, 
username@hotmail.
com
, username@yahoo.com
, etc. The University recognizes that there may be extenuating circumstances where 
communication is 
required but access to UM email accounts is limited, e.g., emergencies.  [In these cases, 
employees are encouraged to be resourceful in accomplishing
 their work and
 always
 mindful of 
related security issues. 
 PROVISIONS You are entitled onl
y to one person's fair share of University resources unless written permission 
to the contrary has been granted by the Chief Information Officer (CIO). See 
http://www.
olemiss.edu/depts/it/policy/
 for oth
er technology
-related policies.
 The 
following list includes
 examples of prohibited 
activities
, and is
 not 
inclusive of
 everything
 that is a violation:
 YOU MAY NOT
 use
 the University computing or telecommunications systems to violate 
copyright law.  [Copyright law limits the right of a user to copy, download, distribute, edit, or 
transmit electronically another's intellectual property, including written materials, images
, videos, software, games, sounds, music, and performances, even in an educational context 
without permission. Violations of copyright law may include giving others unauthorized access 
to copyrighted materials by posting that material on social networking 
sites, downloading from 
Internet websites or through peer
-to-peer (P2P) file sharing any material owned by another 
without the ownerÕs permission, or sharing files that include copyrighted material with others 
through peer
-to-peer software or networks.  [Pe
er-to-peer is a method of file sharing that allows 
normal users ("peers") to connect directly to other users to share files. This can be contrasted 
with a server
-based distribution method, where users connect to a server (such as a web server 
via 
their b
rowser) to download files. If you have P2P file
-sharing applications installed on your 
computer, you may be sharing copyrighted works without even realizing it. Even if you do not 
intend to engage in infringing activity, installing P2P software on a computer
 can easily result in 
you unintentionally sharing files (copyrighted music or even sensitive documents) with other 
P2P users, and you may then be personally responsible for the le
gal and financial consequences.
 Examples
: You use a file
-sharing program or c
lient, like BitTorrent, Gnutella, and 
LimeWire, Kazaa, BearShare, or others, to download or distribute movies, songs, games 
or software without authorization from the copyright owner. RIAA (Recording Industry 
of America) and MPAA (Motion Picture Associatio
n of America) can and do 
aggressively look for these violations. Alternatively, if you join iTunes and purchase 
several songs to play on your iPod, this is not a violation of copyright law. 
 In addition to the penalties outlined elsewhere in this policy, i
nfringement of copyrighted work, 
including unauthorized P2P file sharing, may also involve civil lawsuits by the copyright owner.  [
Possible penalties include actual damages and profits or statutory damages of up to $30,000
 or 
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!4!more
 for each wo
rk infringed (
or up to $150,000 
or more
 for each willful infringement), court 
costs, attorney fees, and other civil damages.  [Criminal penalties for willful infringement may 
include, depending upon the value of the work(s) infringed, fines and imprisonment for up to 3 
years
 or more
 as provided in 18 USC 2319.
  [Please be aware that there are many legal alternatives for downloading media such as iTunes, 
Pandora, NetFlix, and Amazon MP3.  [A list of popular, legal, fee
-based and free alternatives is 
available to you at: 
 http://www.educause.edu/legalcontent
.  [See the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) 
(http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html
) and related federa
l regulations at 34 
C.F.R. ¤¤ 668.14 (b)(30) & 668.43(a)(10) for other copyright
-related requirements for US 
colleges and universities. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 steal, forge, lie or cheat with; snoop on; tamper with; misuse, damage, harass 
with; threaten with; hoard o
r monopolize; interfere with; violate the confidentiality of; 
masquerade with; or destroy any information, resource, equipment or software. This includes 
using your 
personal 
computing device
 for these
 activities against other users or against their 
informa
tion resources.
 Examples
: You must not access the account of another; you must not generate activities 
which consume more than your share of either system time or network bandwidth 
(including chain letters); you must not fraudulently log into any computer,
 etc. 
(Reference:
 http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode
/ (97/045
) You must not upload, 
post, or transmit content that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, libelous, invasive of 
another's privacy. This includes but is not limited to social networking sites, blogs, 
email or other electronic correspondence. You must not
 forge 
email headers or manipulate 
other identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any system or network activity.
  [YOU MAY NOT
 possess any software, resource, or equipment whose purpose is to effect one 
of the violations listed in the 
previous
 Provis
ion
 nor may you attempt to violate the previous 
Provision. Any such attempt will be considered to be the same as a violation.
  [Example
: You must not have in your account on any University
-owned system or on your 
personal computer programs 
that
 attempt to determine the passwords of others or obtain 
privileges on any computer to which you are not entitled.
  [If you attempt to obtain system 
privileges to which you are not entitled, you are as guilty as if you had succeeded. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 possess, wi
llingly receive, or distribute obscene material.
  [Examples
: Child pornography is absolutely against the law. It is a violation of Federal 
law to transmit this material across state lines, even electronically, and certain obscene 
materials are in violation 
of the Mississippi Code. (References:
 http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode/
 (97/005/0029)
 and 
http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mscode/
 (97/029/0101
)  [YOU MAY NOT
 violate the 
IT Appropriate Use Policy off
-campus anywhere in the world 
using University resources.
  [
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!5!Example
: An attempt to gain unauthorized entry to any computer off the University 
campus is as if you attempted to gain access to a computer here. 
 YOU MAY NOT
 use any University facility for non
-University commercial business or 
advertising, including unsolicited commercial 
email without written permission from the Provost 
and the CIO. Th
is includes partisan political activities; however, any officially sanctioned 
University student 
group may maintain an official W
eb page which presents objective 
information about the group itself. Commercial sponsorship of academic projects, e.g., the 
inclusion of banner ads on project web sites, is allowed in certain cases. These requests must be 
approved by the CIO.
  [Examples
: You may not use the statistics software on the academic shared systems to do 
work for off
- campus entities for which you are p
aid. The Young Democrats/Republicans 
may have a page 
that
 presents information about their activities and goals; they may not 
attempt to influence voters
Õ choices through that page. The sending of unsolicited bulk 
email (spamming) is not allowed when it is
 unrelated to the UniversityÕs mission.
  [YOU MUST
 connect all equipment and install all software in a manner that meets the technical, 
security
 and fair use standards set by 
the Office of 
Information Te
chnology
 (IT)
.  [Examples
: All IP addresses and domain names are owned and assigned by the 
IT as specified in the 
UM Policy for Domain Name Registration
 . World Wide Web, ftp, and 
other network services that interfere with f
air network use by others may be restricted by 
IT. You must follow proper use guidelines when using classroom technology, e.g.,
 powering down projectors according to vendor specifications. Improperly secured and 
patched systems are vulnerable to attack fro
m outside entities and may be used as 
platforms to propagate spam, computer virus and wormÕs to other hosts both on the 
campus and abroad resulting in loss of bandwidth and possible restrictions to other 
computer systems; accordingly, compromised systems w
ill be disconnected from the 
campus network as soon as they are detected.
  [YOU MUST TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU PUBLISH, TRANSMIT, OR 
POSSESS. PENALTIES 
 If you are suspected of violating this Policy, the University may impound any equipment, device, 
software, documents, or data that is involved. A search warrant will be obtained before 
impounding items not owned by the University. 
 If you have violated the
 Policy, you will incur the same types of disciplinary measures as 
violations of other University policies. Violation of state or federal free/statutes may lead to 
criminal or civil prosecution. 
 Students:
 Campus disciplinary measures may include, but are 
not limited to, failure in a class, 
permanent or temporary loss of information technology privileges, suspension or expulsion from 
the University, and restitution of expenses as well as charges for damages. 
  [

!!!6!Faculty and Staff:
 Campus disciplinary measures
 may include, but are not limited to, 
reassignment of duties, transfer, censure, suspension, termination, and restitution of expenses as 
well as charges for damages. 
 Off
-campus Users:
 The University may revoke the privileges of users who are found to be i
n violation and may report any serious violation to the users home campus authorities and to 
appropriate law enforcement officials. 
 INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
 Violations are most likely to be observed in two ways: 
 ¥!A system administrator detec
ts an anomaly and, in determining the cause of the problem, 
finds evidence of a violation. 
  [Caution:
 In exceptional cases, a system or network administrator may detect evidence of 
a violation while performing his or her duties operating or maintaining a s
ystem. In these 
instances the priorities of protecting the University against seriously damaging 
consequences and/or safeguarding the integrity of computers, networks, and data either at 
the University or elsewhere, may make it imperative that the systems 
administrator take 
temporary restrictive action immediately. In these instances, all restrictive actions taken 
must be documented and justified in accordance with this policy. The Complaint 
Committee and/or 
IT Security Coordinator
 must be immediately conta
cted so the 
complaint can be further investigated and processed.
 ¥!An individual observes what is perceived to be a violation. The office to be notified is 
determined by the status of the suspected violator: 
 o!Students: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Dean of Students. 
 o!Faculty: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Provost.  [
 o!Staff: Suspicious activities should be reported to the Vice Chancellor for 
Administration and Finance.  [[Minor 
infractions by any account holder may be 
reported directly to the Complaints Committee (
complaint@olemiss.edu)
.]  [The Complaints Committee accepts reports of minor infractions (anything which is not serious 
and
 which should be correctable by pointing out the infraction to the offender, e.g., a business 
card on a web page) and attempts to resolve them within 
seven 
business
 days
.  [If not resolved, 
the violator 
is reported through the 
IT Security Coordinator
 to 
his
 or her 
administrative office for 
stronger action. The systems administrator of a compromised system is free at any time to take 
immediate action to safeguard the University's infrastructure, including working with campus 
security to obtain a search warran
t at the first sign of suspicious activity. 
 IT personnel will also 
document the actions taken from the point of discovery and will prepare a non
-technical 
narrative for the use of the University. The CIO or designee may authorize monitoring of 
systems to 
gather information on any activity that is using University
-owned equipment or 
services. These activities will be logged by the systems administrator when undertaken and will 
be conducted in an appropriate manner approved by the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and the CIO.
  [
!"#$!%&'($)*'+,!-.!/'**'**'00'
!!!7!Incidents will be reported by the systems administrator to the 
IT Security Coordinator
, possibly 
the Complaints Committee, and, in addition, to the appropriate disciplinary office(s) (Dean of 
Students, Provost, or Vice Chancellor of Finance 
& Administration). These units will authorize 
such additional steps as may be necessary to collect evidence, including the execution of a search 
warrant, and setting the scope and duration of the investigation. The Complaints Committee and 
the 
IT Security 
Coordinator
 will work with the disciplinary office to decide when to notify the 
individuals involved that they are under investigation. If non
-University service providers are 
involved, they will consult with the University Attorney and the CIO to notify t
hem as soon as it 
is prudent to do so.
  [The collected evidence and the documents that record the actions of the systems administrator, 
IT staff, and the Complaints Committee will be forwarded to the disciplinary office for 
adjudication together with a reco
mmendation on any loss of privileges with respect to computing 
and telecommunications systems. The disciplinary office will report the outcome of the case to 
the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and to the CIO. In the case of suspected criminal violations, the 
Univ
ersity Police will be involved.
  [The accused has the right to petition the disciplinary office for the release of impounded material 
and the restoration of privileges. That decision may or may not precede the disposition of the 
case. In any event, any such
 decision must be communicated to the 
IT Security Coordinator
 and 
the systems administrator. Faculty and staff members against whom disciplinary action is taken 
may follow the prescribed methods for the resolution of work
-related conflicts, including the 
filing of a grievance.

 to meet
 their
 diverse 
requirements
 (e.g.,
 collaboration,
 research,
 communication,
 etc.). 
While
 critical
 to the
 business of 
the
 university, 
these
 technologies
 also introduce 
risks. The
 risks
 and
 corresponding 
threats
 associated
 with
 IT 
are
 increasing
 in both number and
 variety.
 Information
 technology
 infrastructures
 are
 increasingly
 complex
 to implement and
 administer.
  [The
 advent
 of hacking
 tools
 and persons
 willing
 to distribute 
viruses
 and 
malicious code
 have
 increased 
the
 risks
 to IT organizations and 
the
 assets 
they
 are 
charged
 to safeguard.
 B. University 
mission
-critical
 functions
 supported
 by 
IT systems
 continue
 to expand. 
Although
 some
 data and 
systems may
 not be
 classified
 as mission
 critical,
 they
 nevertheless
 represent
 a significant
 investment
 in resources,
 may
 contain
 sensitive
 data,
 and
 are
 efficient
 methods
 of providing 
a wide 
range
 of education 
related
 services.
 Coupled with
 overall 
system
 integration and inte
rconnectivity,
 university 
systems
 and 
networks are increasingly at 
risk
 to intrusions, 
misuse
 of data, and other attacks 
from
 both
 internal and 
external sources.
 C. A successful
 security
 framework
 is reliant
 upon strong
 leadership
 support
 and
 a comprehensive
 body of effective
 and
 efficient 
IT security
 standards
 and procedures 
that:
 1. Promote
 public 
trust,
 2. Ensure
 continuity
 of services,
 3. Comply
 with
 legal
 and
 contractual
 requirements,
 4. Recognize 
risks
 and 
threats,
 and
 5. Protect 
systems assets
.  [VIII.
 Enforcement
 Failure
 to comply
 with
 these
 policies 
may
 result
 in suspension
 of access
 to information
 assets
 and information 
systems 
or both and
 may
 also 
result
 in disciplinary action,
 up 
to and
 including
 termination
 and
 criminal
 prosecution.

Date of Origin:  [August 9, 2017
 Date of Revision(s):  [August 9, 2017
 Effective Date:  [August 9, 2017
  [ 532.1
 PREFACE
  [Utah State University provides undergraduate and graduate scholarships to students through 
funds provided by donors, federal and state governments, and University general funds. 
This 
policy establishes the framework to ensure that proper stewardship, guide
lines, and internal 
controls are in place to achieve the highest level of public trust and to ensure that student 
needs are considered in the process.
  [Scholarship awarding requires an understanding of best practices that foster accountability, 
protect emp
loyee integrity, and safeguard University funds. For purposes of this policy, 
scholarships include both qualified and non
-qualified scholarship awards.
  [532.2
 DEFINITIONS
  [Central Scholarship Committee: 
This committee will review and approve scholarship
- awarding procedures proposed by each college and interpret scholarship language on existing 
donor agreements as necessary. Membership will consist of: two (2) standing representatives 
Œ the Director of th
e Scholarship Office and the Executive Director of Budget and Planning. In 
addition, there will be:
 - one (1)
 academic
 dean
 or designee
 to be appointed
 by the
 Provost
 for
 a two
 (2)
 year 
term;
 - one (1) financial officer to be appointed by the Vice President of Business and
 Finance 
for a two (2) year term;
 and
 - three
 (3)
 rotating
 college
 representatives
 to be recommended
 by the
 Provost,
 approved
 by 
the
 two
 standing
 representatives,
 rotated
 annually
.  [The Central Scholarship Committee is the primary source of information, education, and 
assistance on the topics noted within this policy.
 
2  [College Scholarship Committee
: Interprets scholarship language on existing donor agreements, 
reviews recipient requirements, and determines recipients of awards. Ensures scholarship funds 
are utilized in accordance with appropriate intent or donor restrict
ion. The structure and 
membership will be determined by each college.
  [Conflict
-of-Interest: 
An action by an individual reviewing and/or recommending a scholarship 
that results in a direct financial benefit to a person closely affiliated to the individual 
making the 
recommendation. Conflict of interest may also occur if an individual exerts influence to select a 
recipient without considering and documenting objective criteria for the scholarship.
  [Financial Need
-Based Scholarships: 
Scholarships awarded base
d on financial need as defined 
by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
  [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA): 
The FAFSA is the basic student 
financial aid application form used by all two and four
-year colleges, universities, a
nd career 
schools for the awarding of federal student aid and most state and college aid. At USU, the 
Financial Aid Office administers Title IV aid, which is the aid available to students through 
filling out the FAFSA.
  [Non
-Qualified Scholarship: 
Any porti
on of an award, scholarship, fellowship, or grant that 
does not directly pay for those items defined as a qualified scholarship. Non
-qualified 
scholarships are includible in the gross income of the recipient and are subject to withholding. 
For non
-degree n
onresident candidates and nonresident post
-doctoral research scholars, the 
entire award is non
-qualified.
  [Qualified Scholarship: 
Under section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified 
scholarship is one that is used to pay "tuition and fees paid to e
nroll in, or to attend, an 
educational institution" or "fees, book, supplies, and equipment required for the courses at the 
educational institution." Only qualified scholarship payments made to nonresident aliens are 
neither subject to withholding or IRS r
eporting.
  [Scholarship: 
A qualified or non
-qualified grant or payment made to support a student's 
education, awarded on the basis of need or academic or other achievement. Scholarships are not 
repaid. Scholarships may be referred to by various titles (e.g. award, grant, fellowshi
p, etc.).
 However, any titles that fall within the classification of non
-qualified or qualified scholarships 
are considered ﬁscholarshipsﬂ for purposes of this policy.
  [Scholarship Office: 
The Scholarship Office collaborates with scholarship
-awarding colle
ges on 
all scholarship processes and procedures, and provides guidance for maintaining appropriate 
internal controls.
  [Scholarship
-Awarding College: 
Any college within Utah State University that issues, 
evaluates, or oversees scholarships as outlined by th
is policy. Each college determines how 
scholarships are processed within the college, and whether one procedure is sufficient for the 
entire college or if multiple procedures are necessary.
 
3  [532.3
 POLICY
  [Each scholarship
-awarding college shall:
 1) Rec
ognize the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), or a similar need 
based calculating mechanism as approved by the Central Scholarship Committee, as
 the 
official
 resource
 when
 determining
 financial
 need
 for
 need
 based
 scholarships.
 2) Create
 scholarship
-awarding
 procedures,
 in collaboration
 with
 the

  [Reconciliation of Awards (Section
 4.4)  [Timely & Accurate Reporting (Section
 4.5)  [The Central Scholarship Committee will review and approve scholarship
-awarding procedures 
proposed by each college. Approved procedures become the expectation for the college to 
follow. Changes to procedures shoul
d be submitted to the Scholarship Office for review prior to 
implementation.
  [Exemption for Intercollegiate Athletic Scholarships and Grants
-in-aid Program
  [The Vice President and Director of Athletics, as designated by USU Policy 104.4.7(8), retains 
the s
upervision of ﬁthe intercollegiate athletic scholarship and grants
-in-aid program and all 
athletic awards [scholarships] after consultation with and approval of the Athletic Council.ﬂ 
Therefore, the administration, internal controls, processes, and procedu
res for these scholarships 
are excluded from this policy.
  [532.4
 SCHOLARSHIP
-AWARDING
 PROCEDURES
  [4.1 College
 Responsibilities
  [Individuals involved in scholarship awarding should understand procedures in sufficient 
detail to maintain the effectiveness and integrity of the awarding process. Colleges should

procedures to meet smaller operations, contact the Scholarship Office for g
uidance 
regarding compensating controls prior to establishing processes or compromising the 
separation of duties.
  [4.3 Use of
 Funds
  [Scholarship funds must be utilized in accordance with appropriate intent or donor 
restriction.
  [4.4 Reconciliation of

changes in format.
Review by Computer Services is necessary in order that programming requirements and operating
requirements of the high speed printer are considered; i.e., weight of paper stock, type of perforations,
method of attaching multiple part forms (crimp, glue, etc.), type and size of carbon, standard sizes of
paper stock, conformity of layout with programs, vendor reliability for special forms, etc.
Procedures
Using departments should determine the type of form required, purpose of form, data needed,
approximate size, number of copies required, and prepare a draft copy of the form layout. (The
Production Control Manager may offer assistance in the development if desired.) A meeting should be
arranged with the Production Control Manager for review.
The Production Control Manager will review the forms specifications with systems, programming, and
operations areas and resolve any potential problems or discrepancies. The Production Control Manager
will prepare a final copy of the form layout and list the ordering specifications.
A purchase requisition should be processed by the ordering department with five (5) copies of the final
form layout and specifications attached. Three months lead time in ordering is necessary to allow for
bidding and proofs.
Printer's proofs should be reviewed by the Production Control Manager and the ordering department
before giving final approval to the printer.
When forms are delivered, the Production Control Manager will arrange for test runs on the computer
and will review the tests with the ordering department.
The Production Control Manager will maintain a history file of forms and a record of all problems with
each form and with each supplier.
The Computer Services Production Control Manager office is located in the Computer Services Center
and may be contacted by calling Computer Services' Frontline (597-8000) and asking for the Production
Control Manager.

Hampton University Appropriate Use of Technology Policy
Hampton University Appropriate Use of Technology Policy
Hampton University provides and maintains technologies to advance teaching, learning, research, and
administrative activities in support of the University's mission.  [The University views access to all of its
technology resources as a privilege that is granted to members of the University community so long as it
is used responsibly.  [Hampton University reserves the right to monitor and investigate violations or
suspected violations of policy and security.
Students utilizing technology resources shall be held to the standards of conduct set forth elsewhere in
the Student Handbook.  [The faculty and staff shall be held to the standards of conduct set forth
elsewhere in the Faculty and Staff Handbooks, respectively.  [All University rules, particularly those
pertaining to the Code of Conduct and the consequences of acts of dishonesty, harassment, plagiarism,
piracy and illegal or inappropriate use of software are applicable to the use of computers, cell phones,
personal data assistants (PDAs), and other technologies.
Users can have a reasonable expectation of privacy, except those times when system administrators find
cause to investigate network activity for purposes related to operations and compliance with University
policy and federal and state laws.  [The vice president of student affairs will process violations of
University policy by students.  [ The director of human resources and the provost will process violation of
University policy by faculty and/or staff. Infringements made known to the assistant provost for
technology by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Business Software Alliance, MGM
and NBC Universal Properties and the like will be processed by the assistant provost for technology with
written notification to the vice president of student affairs or director of human resources and/or provost
where applicable.
Users found in violation of this policy may direct appeals to the vice president for student affairs, the
Technology Guide : Appropriate Use of Technology

director of human resources and/or the provost within three business days.  [A written response will be
provided within ten business days.
The following is intended to ensure that all members of the University computing community can be
afforded privacy in his/her work; that no one will be unwillingly subjected to abusive behavior of others
using the system; that the resources available to the community are not consumed by only a few
individuals; and that electronic vandalism does not destroy computer resources.  [It should be
understood clearly that the following points are illustrative and not all-inclusive.
1. Only authorized persons defined as students, faculty, staff and members of Hampton
University sanctioned programs, may use Hampton University's computing facilities and
equipment (computers, printers, networks, software, etc.) for legitimate purposes relating to
teaching, coursework, research, and administration at Hampton University.
2. Members of an academic community are entitled to privacy of their work.  [It is a violation of
University policy for an individual faculty, staff or student to share their own login
information with others to use, to obtain a password that belongs to someone else, or to
access another user's files or e-mail account on the network.  [These violations are forms of
theft and will not be tolerated.
3. Any faculty, staff or student may not access any file that is not their own unless that file has
been made publicly accessible.  [This access prohibits the reading, writing, and editing of
directories and passwords belonging to others.  [This prohibition includes, but is not limited
to, files left on a computer hard drive or any removable storage device, i.e., zip disks, thumb
drive, CD-ROM/DVD. Posting a message under someone else's name is prohibited.
4. Taking advantage of another person who inadvertently leaves a computer without logging
off is no different than entering an unlocked room and stealing, reading a personal letter, or
destroying property.
5. Using any technology resource to annoy or harass or defame is prohibited.  [This applies to
the use of phone mail, electronic mail, conferencing, news group bulletin boards and
message facilities.  [This includes but is not limited to flooding individuals or news groups
with large volumes of electronic mail designed to disrupt and/or annoy.
6. The Virginia Code, Section 18.2-372 & 374 sets forth the definition of obscene material. The
code also states that the distribution, production or sale of obscene items is illegal, and
punishable by law. Federal law also criminalizes the transportation of such materials in
interstate commerce. Hampton University must comply with these laws and will enforce
them among all students, faculty, staff and visitors.

  [This policy provides guidance for establishing responsibilities and limitations associated with the use of university

The general guiding principle behind the policy is that "cyberspace is not a separate legal 
jurisdiction;" that existing, generally applicable laws, rules, and policies apply equally to the use of university computing
 resources.
 Adherence to this policy wi
ll require compliance with all applicable laws and university policies, and all applicable

 Computing resources
 Computers, computer systems, networks, and devices including but not limited to mobile phones, 
smartphones, and 
other mobile devices, and the institutional data they contain.
 College, department 
and unit policies
 Colleges, departments and units may have policies that provide for additional rights, restrictions and/or 
responsibilities that augment the university policy and apply to specific computers, computer systems, or 
networks, or to users within their specific 
units. These policies require approval by the 
chief 
information 
officer or the 
chief 
information 
officer™s designees.
  [Policy Details
 I. As a part of the physical and social learning infrastructure, Ohio State acquires, develops
, and maintains computers, 
com
puter systems, and networks. These 
computing 
resources
 are intended for university
-related purposes, 
including direct and indirect support of the university's 
teaching
, research, and service missions; university 
administrative functions; student and campus
 life activities; and the free exchange of ideas among members of the 
university community and between the university community and the wider local, national, and world communities.
 II. The rights of academic freedom and freedom of expression apply to the use 
of university computing resources. So, 
too, however, do 
the responsibilities and limitations associated with those rights
. The use of university computing 
resources, like 
the use of any other university
-provided resource and like any other university
-related activity, is 
subject to the requirements of legal, regulatory, and ethical behavior within the university community. Responsible 
use of a computing resource does not ex
tend to whatever is technically possible. Although some limitations are built 
into computer operating systems and networks, those limitations are not the sole restrictions on what is permissible. 
Users must abide by all applicable restrictions, whether or 
not they are built into the operating system or network 
and whether or not they can be circumvented by technical means.

3 Reviewed:
 05/16/2016
  [I. All users of university computing resources must:
 A. Comply with all federal, Ohio, and other applicable law; all generally applicable university rules
, policies
, and 
other governing docum
ents
; and all applicable contracts and licenses. 
 1. Examples of such laws, rules, policies, contracts, and licenses include: the Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act (FERPA); Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); 
laws and regulations 
governing export
 control, which prohibit the electronic transmission of certain types of information to citizens 
of specified countries; laws governing 
libel
, privacy
, copyright
, trademark
, obscenity, and child pornogra
phy; the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act
 and the 
Com
puter Fraud and Abuse Act
, which prohibit hacking, 
and similar activities; 
the Americans With Disabilities Act as reflected in the 
Web Accessibility Policy
; Code 
of Student Condu
ct; 
Sexual 
Misconduct 
Policy
; Institutional Data Policy
; Disclosure or Exposure of Personal 
Information Policy
; and all applicable software licenses. 
 2. Users who engage in electronic communications with persons in other states or countries or on other systems 
or networks should be aware they may also 
be subject to the laws of those other states and countries and the 
rules and policies of those other systems and networks. Users are responsible for ascertaining, understanding, 
and complying with the laws, rules, policies, contracts, and licenses applicab
le to their particular uses.
 B. Use only those computing resources they are authorized to use and use them only in the manner and to 
the extent authorized.
 Ability to access computing resources does not, by itself, imply authorization to do so. 
Users are resp
onsible for ascertaining what authorizations are necessary and for obtaining them before 
proceeding. 
 C. Respect the privacy of other users and their accounts, regardless of whether those accounts are securely 
protected.
 Ability to access other persons' accou
nts does not, by itself, imply authorization to do so. Users are 
responsible for ascertaining what authorizations are necessary and for obtaining them before proceeding.
 D. Respect the finite capacity of the computing resources and limit use so as not to cons
ume an unreasonable 
amount of those resources or to interfere unreasonably with the activity of other users.
 Although there are 
no set bandwidths, disk space, CPU time, or other limitations applicable to all uses of university computing 
resources, the univ
ersity may require users of those computing resources to limit or refrain from specific uses in 
accordance with this principle, using only those resources authorized for use. The reasonableness of any 
particular use will be judged by the university in the 
context of the relevant circumstances.
 E. Refrain from using those resources for personal commercial purposes or for personal financial or other 
gain.
 Personal use of university computing resources for other purposes is permitted when it does not consume 
a significant amount of those resources, does not interfere with the performance of the user's job or other 
university responsibilities, and is otherwise in compliance with this policy. Further limits may be imposed upon 

personal use in accordance with normal 
supervisory procedures or as a matter of college, department
, or unit 
policy.

trademarks and logos without authorization to do so.
 Affiliation with the u
niversity does not, by itself, 
imply authorization to speak on behalf of the university. This also extends to the use of social media. 
Authorization to use university trademarks and logos on university computing resources may be granted only by 
University Communications
 or 
Trademark and Licensing
, as appropriate. Contact these offices for further 
information and authorization.
 G. FAQs regarding this policy 
(see Resources section) are provided for additional clarification and are 
incorporated by reference as part of this policy.
 II. Security and Privacy
 A. The university employs various measures to protect the security of its computing resources and of their users' 

accounts. Users should be aware that the university cannot guarantee such security. Users should engage in 
"safe computing" practices by establishing appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding their 
passwords, and changing them regularly.
 Accounts and passwords may not be shared with, or used by, persons 
other than those to whom they have been assigned by the university.
  [B. While the university does not routinely monitor individual usage of its computing resources, the university may 
specifi
cally monitor the activity and access the accounts of individual users of university computing resources, 
including individual login sessions and communications, without notice, when:
 1. The user has given permission or has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, for example by 

posting to a publicly
-accessible web page or providing publicly
-accessible network services. 
 2. It reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integr
ity, security, or functionality of the university 
or other computing resources or to protect the university from liability.
 3. There is reasonable cause to believe the user has violated, or is violating, this policy.
 4. An account appears to be engaged in unusua
l or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the reviewing 
of general activity and usage patterns.
 5. Access is necessary and conducted pursuant to applicable university rules, policies or procedures.  [
 6. It is otherwise required or permitted by law.
 Any 
such individual monitoring, other than that specified above, required by law, or necessary to respond to 
perceived emergency situations, must be authorized in  [advance by the 
Chief Information Officer or the Chief 
Information Officer's designees (see Conta
cts section below).
 C. Users should be aware the use of university computing resources may not be private. For example, the normal 
operation and maintenance of the university's computing resources require the backup and caching of data and 
communications, log
ging of activity, reviewing of general usage patterns for the unauthorized disclosure of 
institutional data, scanning of systems and network ports for anomalies and vulnerabilities, and other such 
activities that are necessary to render service or to meet 
university legal obligations 
 D. The university, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any such general or individual monitoring, including 

the contents and records of individual communications, to appropriate university personnel or law enforcement 
agencies and may use those results in university disciplinary proceedings. Communications made by means of 
university computing resources are also generally subject to Ohio's Public Records Act to the same extent as 
they would be if made on paper.
 III.
 Enforcem
ent
 A. Users who violate this policy may be denied access to university computing resources and may be subject to 
other penalties and disciplinary action, both within and outside of the university. Violations will normally be 
handled through the university di
sciplinary procedures applicable to the relevant user. For example, alleged 
violations by students will normally be investigated, and any penalties or other discipline will normally be 
imposed, by the Office of Student Conduct. 
 B. The university may temporar
ily suspend or block access to an account, prior to the initiation or completion of 
such disciplinary procedures, when it reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security, or

X-1.00(A) UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND POLICY ON THE ACCEPTABLE 
USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES (Approved by the President, April 5, 2006) PRIMARY PRINCIPLES: FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY  [Freedom of expression and an open environment to pursue scholarly inquiry and for sharing of information are encouraged, supported, and protected at the University of Maryland. These values lie at the core of our academic community. Censorship is not compatible with the tradition and goals of the University. While some computing resources are dedicated to specific 
research, teaching, or administrative tasks that would limit their use, freedom of expression must, in general, be protected. The University does not limit access to information because of its content when it meets the standard of legality. The University's policy of freedom of expression applies to computing resources.  [Concomitant with free expression are personal obligations of each member of our community to use computing resources responsibly, ethically, and in a manner which accords both with the law and the rights of others. The University depends first upon a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation to create and maintain an open community of responsible users. GENERAL  [This policy sets forth standards for responsible and acceptable use of University information technology (IT) resources. These resources include computer systems, computer labs, applications, 
networks, software, and files. IT resources are provided to support the academic, research, 
instructional, and administrative objectives of the University. 
These resources are extended for the sole use of University faculty, staff, students, and all other authorized guests to accomplish tasks related to the status of that individual at the University, and consistent with the University™s mission. X-1.00(A) page 1 
Those using University IT resources, whether at the University or elsewhere, are responsible for complying with security standards set forth by the Vice President and Chief Information Officer (VP/CIO), safeguarding identification codes and 
passwords, and for using them solely for their intended purposes. Individuals are solely responsible for their personal use of IT resources and are prohibited from representing or implying that statements related to such use constitute the views or policies of the University. The maintenance, operation, and security of IT resources require responsible University personnel to monitor and access systems and networks. To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a user™s privacy will be preserved. Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to applicable 
federal and state law, including the Maryland Public Information Act, and the needs of the University to meet its administrative, business, and legal obligations. PROHIBITED CONDUCT  [The following provisions describe conduct prohibited under this 
policy: 1. Altering system software or hardware configurations without 
authorization; disrupting or interfering with the delivery 
or administration of IT resources.  [2. Attempting to access or accessing another's accounts, 
private files, e-mail messages, or intercepting network 
communication without the owner's permission except as 
appropriate to your job duties and in accordance with legitimate University purposes.  [3. Misrepresenting oneself as another individual in electronic 
communication.  [4. Installing, copying, distributing, or using digital content 
(including software, music, text, images, and video) in violation of copyright and/or software agreements or applicable federal and state law.  [X-1.00(A) page 2 
5. Engaging in conduct that interferes with others™ use of 
shared IT resources.  [6. Using University IT resources for commercial or profit-
making purposes or to represent the interests of groups unaffiliated with the University or unassociated with the normal professional activities of faculty, staff or students without written authorization from the University. 7. Ignoring individual departmental or unit lab and system 
policies, procedures, and protocols.  [8. Facilitating access to University IT resources by 
unauthorized users.  [9. Exposing sensitive or confidential information or 
disclosing any electronic information that one does not 
have the authority to disclose.  [10.Knowingly using IT resources for illegal activities. Criminal or illegal use may include obscenity, child 
pornography, threats, harassment, copyright infringement, 
University trademark infringement, defamation, theft, identity theft, and unauthorized access.  [ENFORCEMENT  [Violation of the provisions of this policy constitutes 
unacceptable use of IT resources, and may violate other University policies and/or state and federal law. Known or 
suspected violations should be reported to the appropriate University computing unit. Reports may also be sent to the security unit within the Office of Information Technology (abuse@umd.edu). If possible, reports should include a copy of any non-sensitive information relevant to the putative violation. Violations will be acted upon by the appropriate University authorities and/or law enforcement agencies. Violations may result in the restriction or revocation of access to IT resources; faculty, staff, or student disciplinary action; 
academic dishonesty proceedings through the Student Honor Council; or legal action. X-1.00(A) page 3 
The VP/CIO or designee may suspend, block, relocate to a secure location, or restrict access to information and network resources when necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of University IT resources or to protect the 
University from liability. Notice of such action will be provided to the designated security contact for the affected unit. ADMINISTRATION  [Individual areas within the University (including divisions, 
colleges, schools, and departments) may elaborate upon this 
policy with unit-specific policies as long as they do not violate the spirit and intent expressed elsewhere in this policy. Consistent with University System of Maryland requirements, this policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed based on the recommendations of the VP/CIO.  [X-1.00(A) page 4

Principles:
 
The University has chosen to adopt the policy principles established in the National 
Institute of Standards (NIST) 800 series of publicati
ons, and this policy is based on 
those guidelines.
 
The Chancellor or equivalent at each Campus must designate an individual or functional 
position responsible for information security at their Campus (Position of Authority 
and/or Campus 
Authority). The individual or position should be at a high enough 
organizational level to allow him/her to speak with authority on and for the Campus.
 
Each Campus must develop or adopt and adhere to a program which demonstrates 
compliance with this policy 
and related standards. This program is the responsibility of 
the Position of Authority.
 
A Campus may apply more stringent requirements than those documented in this policy 
provided they do not conflict with or lower the standards or requirements establishe
d by 
this or any other University policy.
 
Each User of University resources is required to be familiar and comply with University 
policies. Acceptance of this policy is assumed if a User accesses, uses, or handles 
University resources.
 
Policy:
 
1.
 
User Privacy
 
 
a.
 
There should be no expectation of privacy on the part of the User.
 
b.
 
As required by state law, the University hereby notifies users that email 
may be a public record and open to public inspection under the 
Tennessee Open Records Act, unless the email is co
vered by an 
exception to the Act, such as personally identifiable student information, 
proprietary information, or trade secrets (See UT Information 
Classification Policy: IT 0115, sections two and three).

1.0 Purpose 
 
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance that limits the use of encryption to those 
algorithms that have received substantial public review and have been proven to work 
effectively. Additionally, this policy provides direction to
 
ensure that Federal regulations are 
followed, and legal authority is granted for the dissemination and use of encryption technologies 
outside of the United States.

3.0 Policy 
(See OIT STD 
023
)
 
Proven, standard algorithms such as DES, Blowfish, RSA, RC5 and IDEA should be used as the 
basis for encryption technologies. These algorithms represent the actual cipher used for an 
appro
ved application. For example, Network Associate's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) uses a 
combination of IDEA and RSA or Diffie
-
Hellman, while Secure Socket Layer (SSL) uses RSA 
encryption. Symmetric cryptosystem key lengths must be at least 56 bits. Asymmetric c
rypto
-
system keys must be of a length that yields equivalent strength.

The use of proprietary encryption algorithms is not allowed 
for any purpose, unless reviewed by 
qualified experts outside of the vendor in question and approved by 
Information Technology 
Security
. Be aware that the export of encryption technologies is restricted by the U.S. 
Government. Residents of countries other 
than the United States should make themselves aware 
of the encryption technology laws of the country in which they reside.

Application Service 
Providers
 
(ASP) Policy
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This document de
scribes Information Security's requirements of Application Service Providers 
(ASPs) that engage with University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
 
  [  [  [
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This policy applies to any use of Application Service Providers by University of Louisiana at 
Lafay
ette, independent of where hosted. 
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.0 Policy 
 
3.1 Requirements of Project Sponsoring 
Division
 
The ASP Sponsoring 
Division
 
must first establish that its project is an appropriate one for the 
ASP model, prior to engaging any additional infrastruct
ure teams within University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette or ASPs external to the company. The person/team wanting to use the ASP service 
must confirm that the ASP chosen to host the application or project complies with this policy. 
The Business Function to be
 
outsourced must be evaluated against the following: 
 
 
1.
 
The requester must go through the ASP engagement process with the ASP Tiger Team to 
ensure affected parties are properly engaged.
 
2.
 
In the event that University of Louisiana at Lafayette data or applicat
ions are to be 
manipulated by, or hosted at, an ASP's service, the ASP sponsoring 
division
 
must have 
written, explicit permission from the data/application owners. A copy of this permission 
must be provided to Information Technology Security. 
 
3.
 
The informat
ion to be hosted by an ASP must fall under the "Minimal" or "More 
Sensitive" categories. Information that falls under the "Most Sensitive" category may not 
be outsourced to an ASP. Refer to the 
Information Sensitivity Policy
 
for additional 
details.
 
4.
 
If the 
ASP provides confidential information to University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the 
ASP sponsoring 
division
 
is responsible for ensuring that any obligations of 
confidentiality are satisfied. This includes information contained in the ASP's application. 
Univ
ersity of Louisiana at Lafayette's legal services department should be contacted for 
further guidance if questions about third
-
party data arise. Projects that do not meet these 
criteria may not be deployed to an ASP.
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.2 Requirements of the Applic
ation Service Provider
 
Information Technology Security has created an associated document, entitled 
ASP Security 
Standards
 
that sets forth the minimum security requirements for ASPs. The ASP must 
demonstrate compliance with these Standards in order to be c
onsidered for use. 
 
 
The ASP engagement process includes an Information Technology Security evaluation of 
security requirements. The 
ASP Security Standards
 
can be provided to ASPs that are either being 
considered for use by University of Louisiana at Lafay
ette, or have already been selected for use.

Information Technology Security may request that additional security measures be implemented 
in addition to the measures stated in the 
ASP Security Standards
 
document, depending on the 
nature of the project. I
nformation Technology Security may change the requirements over time, 
and the ASP is expected to comply with these changes. 
 
 
ASPs that do not meet these requirements may not be used for University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette projects.

ASP 
Security
 
Standards
 
 
1.0 Overview 
 
This document defines the minimum security criteria that an Application Service Provider (ASP) 
must meet in order to be considered for use by University of Louisiana at
 
Lafayette. As part of 
the ASP selection process, the ASP Vendor must demonstrate compliance with the Standards 
listed below by responding in writing to EVERY statement and question in the six categories. 
Information Technology Security  [(IT
-
SEC) will clos
ely review the vendor responses, and will 
suggest remediation measures in any areas that fall short of the minimum security criteria. (IT
-
SEC) approval of any given ASP resides largely on the vendor's response to this document.
 
 
These Standards are subject
 
to additions and changes without warning by IT
-
SEC.  [ 
 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This document can be provided to ASPs that are either being considered for use by University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette, or have already been selected for use.  [ 
 
 
3.0 Responding to These S
tandards
 
IT
-
SEC is looking for explicitly detailed, technical responses to the following statements and 
questions.  [ASPs should format their responses directly beneath the Standards (both questions 
and requirements) listed below.  [In addition, please inclu
de any security whitepapers, technical 
documents, or policies that you may have.  [
 
 
Answers to each Guideline should be specific and avoid generalities, e.g.:
 
 
Examples:
 
 
Bad: "We have hardened our hosts against attack." 
 
Good: "We have applied all securit
y patches for Windows 2000 as of 8/31/2000 to our 
servers.  [ Our Administrator is tasked with keeping up
-
to
-
date on current vulnerabilities that 
may affect our environment, and our policy is to apply new patches during our maintenance 
period (2300hrs, Satu
rday) every week.  [ Critical updates are implemented within 24 hours.  [ 
A complete list of applied patches is available to University of Louisiana at Lafayette." 
 
 
Bad:  ["We use encryption." 
 
Good:  ["All communications between our site and University of Lo
uisiana at Lafayette will 
be protected by IPSec ESP Tunnel mode using 168

1.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette reserves the right to periodically audit the University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure to ensure compliance with the ASP 
Policy and these Standards.  [Non
-
intrusive network audits (basic portscan
s, etc.) may be 
done randomly, without prior notice.  [More intrusive network and physical audits may be 
conducted on site with 24 hours notice.  [
 
 
2.
 
The ASP must provide a proposed architecture document that includes a full network 
diagram of the University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette Application Environment, illustrating 
the relationship between the Environment and any other relevant networks, with a full 
data flowchart that details where University of Louisiana at Lafayette data resides, the 
applications that
 
manipulate it, and the security thereof.  [ 
 
 
3.
 
The ASP must be able to immediately disable all or part of the functionality of the 
application should a security issue be identified.  [ 
 
4.2 Physical Security
 
 
1.
 
The equipment hosting the application for Univers
ity of Louisiana at Lafayette must be 
located in a physically secure facility, which requires badge access at a minimum.  [ 
 
 
2.
 
The infrastructure (hosts, network equipment, etc.) hosting the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette application must be located in
 
a locked cage
-
type environment.  [ 
 
 
3.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette shall have final say on who is authorized to enter 
any locked physical environment, as well as access the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette Application Infrastructure.  [ 
 
 
4.
 
The ASP
 
must disclose who amongst their personnel will have access to the environment 
hosting the application for University of Louisiana at Lafayette.  [ 
 
 
5.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette's Corporate Asset Protection team requires that the 
ASP disclose their
 
ASP background check procedures and results prior to IT
-
SEC 
granting approval for use of an ASP.  [
 
4.3 Network Security 
 
 
1.
 
The network hosting the application must be air
-
gapped from any other network or 
customer that the ASP may have.  [This means the Univ
ersity of Louisiana at Lafayette 
application environment must use separate hosts, and separate infrastructure.  [
 
 
2.
 
How will data go between University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the ASP? Keep in 
mind the following two things: 
 
 
a.
 
If University of Louisiana
 
at Lafayette will be connecting to the ASP via a private 
circuit (such as frame relay, etc.), then that circuit must terminate on the University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette extranet, and the operation of that circuit will come under the 
procedures and polic
ies that govern the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Partner 
Network Management Group.
 

Page 
20
 
of 
77
 
 
 
b.
 
If, on the other hand, the data between University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the 
ASP will go over a public network such as the Internet, appropriate firewalling
 
technology must be deployed by the ASP, and the traffic between University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette and the ASP must be protected and authenticated by 
cryptographic technology (See Cryptography below).  [ 
 
4.4 Host Security 
 
 
1.
 
The ASP must disclose how and
 
to what extent the hosts (Unix, NT, etc.) comprising the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure have been hardened 
against attack.  [If the ASP has hardening documentation for the CAI, provide that as well.  [ 
 
 
2.
 
The ASP must provide
 
a listing of current patches on hosts, including host OS patches, 
web servers, databases, and any other material application.  [ 
 
 
3.
 
Information on how and when security patches will be applied must be provided.  [ How 
does the ASP keep up on security vulnera
bilities, and what is the policy for applying 
security patches? 
 
 
4.
 
The ASP must disclose their processes for monitoring the integrity and availability of 
those hosts.  [ 
 
 
5.
 
The ASP must provide information on their password policy for the University of 
Louisi
ana at Lafayette application infrastructure, including minimum password length, 
password generation guidelines, and how often passwords are changed.  [ 
 
 
6.
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette cannot provide internal usernames/passwords for 
account generation
, as the company is not comfortable with internal passwords being in 
the hands of third parties.  [With that restriction, how will the ASP authenticate users? 
(e.g., LDAP, Netegrity, Client certificates.) 
 
 
7.
 
The ASP must provide information on the account ge
neration, maintenance and 
termination process, for both maintenance as well as user accounts.  [Include information 
as to how an account is created, how account information is transmitted back to the user, 
and how accounts are terminated when no longer need
ed.  [ 
 
4.5 Web Security 
 
 
1.
 
At University of Louisiana at Lafayette's discretion, the ASP may be required to disclose 
the specific configuration files for any web servers and associated support functions (such 
as search engines or databases).  [ 
 
 
2.
 
Please disc
lose whether, and where, the application uses Java, Javascript, ActiveX, PHP 
or ASP (active server page) technology.  [ 
 
 
3.
 
What language is the application back
-
end written in? (C, Perl, Python, VBScript, etc.) 
 
 

Page 
21
 
of 
77
 
 
4.
 
Please describe the ASP process for doing sec
urity Quality Assurance testing for the 
application.  [For example, testing of authentication, authorization, and accounting 
functions, as well as any other activity designed to validate the security architecture.  [ 
 
 
5.
 
Has the ASP done web code review, inclu
ding CGI, Java, etc, for the explicit purposes of 
finding and remediating security vulnerabilities?  [If so, who did the review, what were 
the results, and what remediation activity has taken place?  [If not, when is such an 
activity planned? 
 
4.6 Cryptograp
hy 
 
 
1.
 
The University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure cannot utilize any 
"homegrown" cryptography 

 
any symmetric, asymmetric or hashing algorithm utilized 
by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure must utili
ze 
algorithms that have been published and evaluated by the general cryptographic 
community.  [ 
 
 
2.
 
Encryption algorithms must be of sufficient strength to equate to 168
-
bit TripleDES.  [ 
 
 
3.
 
Preferred hashing functions are SHA
-
1 and MD
-
5.  [ 
 
 
4.
 
Connections to the
 
ASP utilizing the Internet must be protected using any of the 
following cryptographic technologies: IPSec, SSL, SSH/SCP, PGP.  [ 
 
 
5.
 
If the University of Louisiana at Lafayette application infrastructure requires PKI, please 
contact University of Louisiana a
t Lafayette Information Security Group for additional 
guidance.  [

DB 
Password
 
Policy
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This policy states the requirements for securely storing and retrieving database usernames and 
passwords (i.e., database cred
entials) for use by a program that will access a database running on 
one of University of Louisiana at Lafayette's networks. 
 
 
Computer programs running on University of Louisiana at Lafayette's networks often require the 
use of one of the many internal da
tabase servers. In order to access one of these databases, a 
program must authenticate to the database by presenting acceptable credentials. The database 
privileges that the credentials are meant to restrict can be compromised when the credentials are 
impr
operly stored. 
 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This policy applies to all software that will access a University of Louisiana at Lafayette, multi
-
user production database.
 
 
3.0 Policy 
 
 
3.1 General 
 
In order to maintain the security of University of Louisiana at Lafayette's 
internal databases, 
access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The 
credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the 
program's source code in clear text. Database creden
tials must not be stored in a location that can 
be accessed through a web server. 
 
 
3.2 Specific Requirements 
 
 
3.2.1. Storage of Data Base User Names and Passwords
 
 

 
Database user names and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing 
body
 
of the program's code. This file must not be world readable. 
 

 
Database credentials may reside on the database server. In this case, a hash number 
identifying the credentials may be stored in the executing body of the program's code. 
 

 
Database credentials 
may be stored as part of an authentication server (i.e., an entitlement 
directory), such as an LDAP server used for user authentication. Database authentication 
may occur on behalf of a program as part of the user authentication process at the 
authenticati
on server. In this case, there is no need for programmatic use of database 
credentials. 
 

 
Database credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web server. 
 

 
Pass through authentication (i.e., Oracle OPS$ authentication) must not allow access to 
the
 
database based solely upon a remote user's authentication on the remote host. 
 

 
Passwords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to the 
Password Policy
. 
 
  [  [  [  [  [  [  [
 

Page 
23
 
of 
77
 
 
3.2.2. Retrieval of Database User Names and Passwords 
 

 
If stored in a fi
le that is not source code, then database user names and passwords must be 
read from the file immediately prior to use. Immediately following database 
authentication, the memory containing the user name and password must be released or 
cleared. 
 
 

 
The scope
 
into which you may store database credentials must be physically separated 
from the other areas of your code, e.g., the credentials must be in a separate source file. 
The file that contains the credentials must contain no other code but the credentials (i
.e., 
the user name and password) and any functions, routines, or methods that will be used to 
access the credentials. 
 
 

 
For languages that execute from source code, the credentials' source file must not reside 
in the same browseable or executable file dire
ctory tree in which the executing body of 
code resides. 
 
 
3. Access to Database User Names and Passwords 
 

 
Every program or every collection of programs implementing a single business function 
must have unique database credentials. Sharing of credentials be
tween programs is not 
allowed. 
 

 
Database passwords used by programs are system
-
level passwords as defined by the 
Password Policy
. 
 

 
Developer groups must have a process in place to ensure that database passwords are 
controlled and changed in accordance with
 
the 
Password Policy
. This process must 
include a method for restricting knowledge of database passwords to a need
-
to
-
know 
basis.

Extranet 
Policy
 
 
 
 
 
1.0 Purpose 
 
This document describes the policy under which third party organizations connect to Universi
ty 
of Louisiana at Lafayette networks for the purpose of transacting business related to University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette. 
 
  [  [  [
 
2.0 Scope 
 
Connections between third parties that require access to non
-
public University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette resou
rces fall under this policy, regardless of whether a telco circuit (such as frame 
relay or ISDN) or VPN technology is used for the connection. Connectivity to third parties such 
as the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that provide Internet access for Univ
ersity of Louisiana 
at Lafayette or to the Public Switched Telephone Network does NOT fall under this policy. 
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.0 Policy 
 
 
3.1 Pre
-
Requisites 
 
 
3.1.1 Security Review
 
All new extranet connectivity will go through a security review with the Informa
tion Security 
department (Information Technology Security). The reviews are to ensure that all access matches 
the business requirements in a best possible way, and that the principle of least access is 
followed.
 
  [  [  [  [  [
 
3.1.2 Third Party Connection Agre
ement
 
All new connection requests between third parties and University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
require that the third party and University of Louisiana at Lafayette representatives agree to and 
sign the 
Third Party Agreement
. This agreement must be signe
d by the Vice President of the 
Sponsoring Organization as well as a representative from the third party who is legally 
empowered to sign on behalf of the third party. The signed document is to be kept on file with 
the relevant extranet group. Documents per
taining to connections into University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette labs are to be kept on file with the [name of team responsible for security of labs].
 
  [  [  [  [  [
 
3.1.3 Business Case
 
All production extranet connections must be accompanied by a valid busines
s justification, in 
writing, that is approved by a project manager in the extranet group. Lab connections must be 
approved by the [name of team responsible for security of labs]. Typically this function is 
handled as part of the 
Third Party Agreement
.
 
  [  [
  [  [  [
 
3.1.4 Point Of Contact
 
The Sponsoring Organization must designate a person to be the Point of Contact (POC) for the 
Extranet connection. The POC acts on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization, and is responsible 

Page 
32
 
of 
77
 
 
for those portions of this policy and 
the 
Third Party Agreement
 
that pertain to it. In the event that 
the POC changes, the relevant extranet Organization must be informed promptly.
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.2 Establishing Connectivity 
 
Sponsoring Organizations within University of Louisiana at Lafayette that
 
wish to establish 
connectivity to a third party are to file a new site request with the proper extranet group. The 
extranet group will engage Information Technology Security to address security issues inherent 
in the project. If the proposed connection is
 
to terminate within a lab at University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette, the Sponsoring Organization must engage the [name of team responsible for 
security of labs]. The Sponsoring Organization must provide full and complete information as to 
the nature of the 
proposed access to the extranet group and  [Information Technology Security, as 
requested.
 
 
All connectivity established must be based on the least
-
access principle, in accordance with the 
approved business requirements and the security review. In no case w
ill University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette rely upon the third party to protect University of Louisiana at Lafayette's network or 
resources.
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.3 Modifying or Changing Connectivity and Access 
 
All changes in access must be accompanied by a valid busi
ness justification, and are subject to 
security review. Changes are to be implemented via corporate change management process. The 
Sponsoring Organization is responsible for notifying the extranet management group and/or 
Information Technology Security whe
n there is a material change in their originally provided 
information so that security and connectivity evolve accordingly.
 
  [  [  [  [
 
3.4 Terminating Access 
 
When access is no longer required, the Sponsoring Organization within University of Louisiana 
at La
fayette must notify the extranet team responsible for that connectivity, which will then 
terminate the access. This may mean a modification of existing permissions up to terminating the 
circuit, as appropriate. The extranet and lab security teams must cond
uct an audit of their 
respective connections on an annual basis to ensure that all existing connections are still needed, 
and that the access provided meets the needs of the connection. Connections that are found to be 
depreciated, and/or are no longer bei
ng used to conduct University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
business, will be terminated immediately. Should a security incident or a finding that a circuit 
has been deprecated and is no longer being used to conduct University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
busines
s necessitate a modification of existing permissions, or termination of connectivity, 
Information Technology Security and/or the extranet team will notify the POC or the Sponsoring 
Organization of the change prior to taking any action.

1.0
 
Purpose
 
The I
nformation Sensitivity Policy is intended to help employees determine what information 
can be disclosed to non
-
employees, as well as the relative sensitivity of information that should 
not be disclosed outside of University of Louisiana at Lafayette withou
t proper authorization. 
 
 
The information covered in these guidelines includes, but is not limited to, information that is 
either stored or shared via any means. This includes: electronic information, information on 
paper, and information shared orally or 
visually (such as telephone and video conferencing). 
 
  [  [  [  [
 
All employees should familiarize themselves with the information labeling and handling 
guidelines that follow this introduction. It should be noted that the sensitivity level definitions 
were c
reated as guidelines and to emphasize common sense steps that you can take to protect 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential information (e.g., University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette Confidential information should not be left unattended in confer
ence rooms). 
 
 
Please Note: The impact of these guidelines on daily activity should be minimal. 
 
 
Questions about the proper classification of a specific piece of information should be addressed 
to your manager. Questions about these guidelines should be a
ddressed to VP Information 
Technology.
 
  [  [  [  [

public, is not structured or formatted for the public, and should not be released to the public.  [
Ho
wever, release of these data would not cause damage to the University.
 
 
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential contains all other information. It is a 
continuum, in that it is understood that some information is more sensitive than other 
inform
ation, and should be protected in a more secure manner. Included is information that 
should be protected very closely, individual student information, individual personnel 
information, medical information, social security identification, etc.. Also include
d in University 

Page

of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential is information that is less critical, such as telephone 
directories, and email lists.
 
 
A subset of University of Louisiana at Lafayette Confidential information is "University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette
 
Third Party Confidential" information. This is confidential information 
belonging or pertaining to another corporation which has been entrusted to University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette by that company under non
-
disclosure agreements and other contracts. 
Ex
amples of this type of information include research findings, proprietary software, etc.
 
 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette personnel

The same thing happens on UNIX machines, but data is much more difficult to retrieve on UNIX 
systems.

Individual Access Controls
 
Individual Access Controls are metho
ds of electronically protecting files from being accessed by 
people other than those specifically designated by the owner. On UNIX machines, this is 
accomplished by careful use of the chmod command (use 
man chmod
 
to find out more about it). 

's, this includes using passwords on screensavers, such as Disklock. 
 
  [  [  [  [  [  [
 
Insecure Internet Links
 
Insecure Internet Links are all network links that originate from a locale or travel over lines that 
are not totally under the control of University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Encryption
 
Secure University of Louisiana at Lafayette sensitive information in accordance with the 
Acceptable Encryption Policy
 
(OIT STD 023)
. International issues regarding encryption are 
complex. Follow corporate
 
guidelines on export controls on cryptography, and consult your 
manager and/or corporate legal services for further guidance. 
 
  [  [  [  [  [  [
 
One Time Password Authentication
 
One Time Password Authentication on Internet connections is accomplished by using 
a one time 
password token to connect to University of Louisiana at Lafayette's internal network over the 
Internet. Contact your support organization for more information on how to set this up
. 
 
  [  [  [  [  [  [
 
Physical Security
 
Physical security means either 
having actual possession of a computer at all times, or locking the 
computer in an unusable state to an object that is immovable. Methods of accomplishing this 
include having a special key to unlock the computer so it can be used, thereby ensuring that the
 
computer cannot be simply rebooted to get around the protection. If it is a laptop or other 
portable computer, never leave it alone in a conference room, hotel room or on an airplane seat, 
etc. Make arrangements to lock the device in a hotel safe, or take
 
it with you
. 
When leaving the 
office for the day, secure the laptop and any other sensitive material in a locked drawer or 
cabinet.

1.0 Overv
iew
 
Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for 
user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette's entire corporate network. As such, all Univ
ersity of Louisiana at 
Lafayette employees (including contractors and vendors with access to University of Louisiana 
at Lafayette systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select 
and secure their passwords. 
 
  [  [  [  [ 
  [
 
2.0 Purpose
 
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords, the 
protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change.
 
  [  [  [  [  [  [ 
 
3.0
 
Scope 
 
The scope of this policy includes all personnel who have or are 
responsible for an account (or 
any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette facility, has access to the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette network, or stores any non
-
publi
c University of Louisiana at Lafayette information.
 
 
4.0 Policy 
 
4.1 General 
 

 
All system
-
level passwords (e.g., root, enable, NT admin, application administration 
accounts, etc.) must be changed on at least a quarterly basis.
 

 
All production system
-
level pa
sswords must be part of the Information Technology 
Security administered global password management database.
 

 
All user
-
level passwords (e.g., email, web, desktop computer, etc.) must be changed at 
least every six months. The recommended change interval is 
every four months.
 

 
User accounts that have system
-
level privileges granted through group memberships or 
programs such as "sudo" must have a unique password from all other accounts held by 
that user.
 

 
Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or oth
er forms of electronic 
communication.
 

 
Where SNMP is used, the community strings must be defined as something other than the 
standard defaults of "public," "private" and "system" and must be different from the 
passwords used to log in interactively. A keyed
 
hash must be used where available (e.g., 
SNMPv2).
 

 
All user
-
level and system
-
level passwords must conform to the guidelines described 
below.
 
 
4.2 Guidelines
 

Page 
49
 
of 
77
 
 
A. General Password Construction Guidelines
 
Passwords are used for various purposes at University o
f Louisiana at Lafayette. Some of the 
more common uses include: user level accounts, web accounts, email accounts, screen saver 
protection, voicemail password, and local router logins. Since very few systems have support for 
one
-
time tokens (i.e., dynamic 
passwords which are only used once), everyone should be aware 
of how to select strong passwords. 
 
 
Poor, weak passwords have the following characteristics: 
 
 

 
The password contains less than eight characters 
 

 
The password is a word found in a dictionary (En
glish or foreign) 
 

 
The password is a common usage word such as: 
 
o
 
Names of family, pets, friends, co
-
workers, fantasy characters, etc. 
 
o
 
Computer terms and names, commands, sites, companies, hardware, software. 
 
o
 
The words "University of Louisiana at Lafayett
e", "sanjose", "sanfran" or any 
derivation. 
 
o
 
Birthdays and other personal information such as addresses and phone numbers. 
 
o
 
Word or number patterns like aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, 123321, etc. 
 
o
 
Any of the above spelled backwards. 
 
o
 
Any of the above preceded 
or followed by a digit (e.g., secret1, 1secret) 
 
 
Strong passwords have the following characteristics: 
 
 

 
Contain both upper and lower case characters (e.g., a
-
z, A
-
Z) 
 

 
Have digits and punctuation characters as well as letters e.g., 0
-
9, !@#$%^&*()_+|~
-
=
\
`{
}[]:";'<>?,./) 
 

 
Are at least eight alphanumeric characters long. 
 

 
Are not a word in any language, slang, dialect, jargon, etc. 
 

 
Are not based on personal information, names of family, etc. 
 

 
Passwords should never be written down or stored on
-
line. Try to c
reate passwords that 
can be easily remembered. One way to do this is create a password based on a song title, 
affirmation, or other phrase. For example, the phrase might be: "This May Be One Way 
To Remember" and the password could be: "TmB1w2R!" or "Tmb1W>
r~" or some other 
variation.
 
 
NOTE: Do not use either of these examples as passwords! 
 
 
B. Password Protection Standards
 
Do not use the same password for University of Louisiana at Lafayette accounts as for other non
-
University of Louisiana at Lafayette ac
cess (e.g., personal ISP account, option trading, benefits, 
etc.). Where possible, don't use the same password for various University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette access needs. For example, select one password for the Engineering systems and a 
separate passwo
rd for IT systems. Also, select a separate password to be used for an NT account 
and a UNIX account. 
 
 

Page 
50
 
of 
77
 
 
Do not share University of Louisiana at Lafayette passwords with anyone, including 
administrative assistants or secretaries. All passwords are to be trea
ted as sensitive, Confidential 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette information.
 
 
Here is a list of "dont's": 
 
 

 
Don't reveal a password over the phone to ANYONE 
 

 
Don't reveal a password in an email message 
 

 
Don't reveal a password to the boss 
 

 
Don't talk a
bout a password in front of others 
 

 
Don't hint at the format of a password (e.g., "my family name") 
 

 
Don't reveal a password on questionnaires or security forms 
 

 
Don't share a password with family members 
 

 
Don't reveal a password to co
-
workers while on vac
ation 
 
 
If someone demands a password, refer them to this document or have them call someone in the 
Information Security Department. 
 
 
Do not use the "Remember Password" feature of applications  [(e.g., Eudora, OutLook, Netscape 
Messenger).
 
 
Again, do not w
rite passwords down and store them anywhere in your office. Do not store 
passwords in a file on ANY computer system (including Palm Pilots or similar devices) without 
encryption.
 
 
Change passwords at least once every six months (except system
-
level passwor
ds which must be 
changed quarterly). The recommended change interval is every four months. 
 
 
If an account or password is suspected to have been compromised, report the incident to 
Information Technology Security and change all passwords. 
 
 
Password cracki
ng or guessing may be performed on a periodic or random basis by Information 
Technology Security or its delegates. If a password is guessed or cracked during one of these 
scans, the user will be required to change it. 
 
 
C. Application Development Standards
 
Application developers must ensure their programs contain the following security precautions. 
Applications:
 

 
should support authentication of individual users, not groups. 
 

 
should not store passwords in clear text or in any easily reversible form. 
 

 
should 
provide for some sort of role management, such that one user can take over the 
functions of another without having to know the other's password. 
 

 
should support TACACS+ , RADIUS and/or X.509 with LDAP security retrieval, 
wherever possible.

D. Use of Passwords and Passphrases for Remote Access Users
 

Page

of

Access to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Networks via remote access is to be controlled 
using either a one
-
time password authentication or a public/private key system with a strong 
passp
hrase. 
 
 
E. Passphrases 
 
Passphrases are generally used for public/private key authentication. A public/private key system 
defines a mathematical relationship between the public key that is known by all, and the private 
key, that is known only to the user.
 
Without the passphrase to "unlock" the private key, the user 
cannot gain access. 
 
 
Passphrases are not the same as passwords. A passphrase is a longer version of a password and 
is, therefore, more secure. A passphrase is typically composed of multiple wor
ds. Because of 
this, a passphrase is more secure against "dictionary attacks." 
 
 
A good passphrase is relatively long and contains a combination of upper and lowercase letters 
and numeric and punctuation characters. An example of a good passphrase: 
 
 
"The*
?#>*@TrafficOnThe101Was*&#!#ThisMorning" 
 
 
All of the rules above that apply to passwords apply to passphrases.

Cable Modem
 
Cable companies such as AT
&T Broadband provide Internet access over 
Cable TV coaxial cable. A cable modem accepts this coaxial cable and can 
receive data from the Internet at over 1.5 Mbps. Cable is currently 
available only in certain communities.
 
 
CHAP
 
Challenge Handshake Authenti
cation Protocol is an authentication method 
that uses a one
-
way hashing function. DLCIData Link
 
Connection 
Identifier ( DLCI) 
is a unique number assigned to a Permanent Virtual 
Circuit (PVC) end point in a frame relay network. DLCI identifies a 
particular 
PVC endpoint within a user's access channel in a frame relay 
network, and has local significance only to that channel. 
 
 
 
Dial
-
in Modem
 
A peripheral device that connects computers to each other for sending 
communications via the telephone lines. The modem 
modulates the digital 
data of computers into analog signals to send over the telephone lines, 
then demodulates back into digital signals to be read by the computer on 
the other end; thus the name "modem" for modulator/demodulator. 
 
 
Dual Homing
 
Having conc
urrent connectivity to more than one network from a 
computer or network device. Examples include: Being logged into the 
Corporate network via a local Ethernet connection, and dialing into AOL 
or other Internet service provider (ISP). Being on a University 
of 
Louisiana at Lafayette
-
provided Remote Access home network, and 
connecting to another network, such as a spouse's remote access. 
Configuring an ISDN router to dial into University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette and an ISP, depending on packet destination. 
 
 
DSL 
 
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a form of high
-
speed Internet access 
competing with cable modems. DSL works over standard phone lines and 
supports data speeds of over 2 Mbps downstream (to the user) and slower 
speeds upstream (to he Internet).
 
 
 
Fram
e Relay
 
A method of communication that incrementally can go from the speed of 
an ISDN to the speed of a T1 line. Frame Relay has a flat
-
rate billing 
charge instead of a per time usage. Frame Relay connects via the 
telephone company's network. 
 
 
ISDN 
 
There
 
are two flavors of Integrated Services Digital Network or SDN: BRI 
and PRI. BRI is used for home office/remote access. BRI has two "Bearer" 
channels at 64kbit  [(aggregate 128kb) and 1 D channel for signaling info. 
 
 
Remote Access 
 
Any access to University
 
of Louisiana at Lafayette's corporate network 
through a non
-
University of Louisiana at Lafayette controlled network, 
device, or medium.

University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
network (such as the Interne
t, or a home network) from a remote device 
(PC, PDA, WAP phone, etc.) while connected into University of 
Louisiana at Lafayette's corporate network via a VPN tunnel. VPN Virtual

URPOSE
 
All individuals and organizational units that use or access university data, technology, and user 
credentials must comply with state and federal laws, statutes, and regulations; must comply with 
all a
pplicable university policies, standards, and procedures; must have prior authorization for 
related activities based on job duties or other demonstrated need, and must not compromise the 
appropriate availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, or sec
urity of data, technology, and 
user credentials.
 
 
In order to successfully carry out its mission, USC will act to protect the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of data, technology, and user credentials. USC promotes responsible 
use and prohibits
 
unauthorized use of these university assets, including for personal or other non
-
university purposes. Such use may be grounds for investigation and disciplinary action.
 
 
D
EFINITIONS
 
AND 
A
CRONYMS
 
Constituents 
are persons and entities that have a 
relationship to any organizational unit of the 
university system, including but not limited to: students (prospective students, applicants for 
admission, enrolled students, campus residents, former students, and alumni), employees (faculty, 
staff, administ
rators, student employees, prospective employees, candidates for employment, 
former employees and retirees), and other affiliates (including but not limited to board members, 
consultants, contractors, donors, invited guests, recipients of goods and service
s, research subjects, 
and volunteers).
 
 
Consumable Software and Devices 
are items purchased by the university which would cost more 
to track, reclaim, or redistribute than the original purchase price.
 
 
Data and Information 
(Data) are, individually or 
collectively, the known values, content, media 
(audio, visual, multimedia), information, intellectual property, official reports, and work product 
which the university or its organizational units collect, issue, produce, process, purchase, transmit, 
mainta
in and/or store regarding university Constituents, business processes, events, operations, 
performance, and services. See also University Data (UNIV 1.51).
 
 
Personal Matters 
are individual or family concerns that are not related to the university, such as 
community activities and outside employment, including promotion, solicitation, services, or 
sales.
 
 

 
2
 
Personal Technology Assets 
are items that have been purchased, provided, or otherwise obtained 
by the User and are not considered university property. Exam
ples include smart phones, tablets, 
personal computers, home network, and third
-
party services such as email and cloud storage.
 
 
Principle of Least Privilege 
(POLP) holds that every user of an asset should be authorized to, and 
should use, only the least s
et of privileges, rights, and 
permissions necessary
 
to complete an 
assigned job or responsibility. In cases where assets, information systems, and services do not 
support strict controls, users are obligated to abide by POLP in their individual activities.
 
 
University Business 
describes processes, transactions, communications, and records produced or 
received by a USC employee or a party acting on behalf of the university, regarding actions, 
operations, services, and Constituents of the university or its un
its, as well as official university 
reports, requests, policies, and procedures; any matter subject to Freedom of Information Act (see 
UNIV 2.00) is considered University Business. Such data may include, but is not limited to, human 
resources, student reco
rds, alumni/development, and other administrative information; data 
classified as Restricted, Confidential, or Internal Use is most often included (see UNIV 1.51).
 
 
The term University Business excludes teaching and learning activities, as well as academic
 
research data, personal property, items that are public record, and intellectual property (see 
ACAF 1.33).
 
 
University Technology Assets 
are university owned hardware, devices, equipment, virtual 
desktop, software, information systems and services (whethe
r on premises or not), databases and 
data stores, datacenters, learning management systems, network (including wired, wireless, 
Internet, and Virtual Private Network), audio, video, communications and telephony, which the 
university purchases, provides, or
 
otherwise acquires.
 
 
User Credentials 
are accounts, email accounts, network username, other user names, identifiers 
and identity badges, digital identities (including those generated internally or under agreement 
with a third party or federated identity s
ervice), and the associated access rights, authorization, and 
services, which the university collects, requires, or issues in order to enable users to access data, 
information, communications, and/or technology, including for authentication.
 
 
User 
(or End 
User) refers to any person or system that accesses university assets including data 
and information systems.

erased before 
disposal
 
 
A shredder must be used for the disposal of sensitive documents
 
 
UPS is required for networking devices and servers
 
 
Where appropriate security acces
s and authorization documentation must be 
retained a minimum of three (3) years
 
 
Restricted data

System Security
 
 
Only authorized personnel m
ust install applications on a server or workstation
 
 
Administrative access to systems will be determined by the local systems 
administrator
 
 
System configuration must be done off line.  [The system must not be 
connected to the network until it is at an approp
riate level of security (see 
Computer Security Standards
 
and 
Security Tips for IT
 
for more 
guidance.)
 
 
Whenever system security has been compromised, or even if there is a 
convincing reason to believe that it has been compromised, the involved 
System Administrator must immediately: (a) reassign all relevant passwords, 
and (b) force every password
 
on the involved system to be changed at the time 
of the next log
-
in.  [If systems software does not provide the latter capability, a 
broadcast message must be sent to all users telling them to change their 
passwords
 
 
Operating systems and applications must 
be kept current.  [Where appropriate, 
all the latest operating and application patches must be applied
 
 
Applications must be 
coded or 
configured with security in mind
 
 
Security, Account, and System level logging must be turned on when a server 
is set up
 
 
All u
nneeded services (e.g., SMTP, Telnet, etc.) must be turned off for 
network devices, such as printers and computers
 
 
Services not intended for the general user must be protected with a host
-
based 
or network
-
based firewall
 
 
Servers must not be used for general
 
purpose computing, such as web 
browsing or reading email and must be strictly used for its intended purpose
 
 
The use of fault tolerant system, such as disk mirroring, server duplexing, or 
RAID is recommended.  [It is required for servers that store mission 
or 
business critical data
 

 
Major applications must be installed on separate servers, e.g., mail on its own 
server, Web files on a separate server
, and in general a database server 
firewalled from Internet facing servers
 
 
Maintenance and Service agree
ments wi
th vendors must be kept
 
current
 
User Account Security
 
 
Each user must have a unique user ID. System administrators must be able to 
uniquely identify all users, including name, user ID, association, phone 


for example, are an exception to this rule
 
 

and saved in a secure location for future reference
 
 

not
 
be readable, writeable or executable 
by other 
users. Access to shared resources should be granted only as needed
 
 
Accounts created for vendors to provide services must only be active during 
the time the service is carried out
 
 
Accounts must be re
-
certified annually to ensure that only valid acc
ounts 
remain active
 
 
All user accounts, where possible, must automatically have the associated 
privileges revoked after 
a certain period of inactivity
 
 
Temporary accounts must have expiration dates
 
 
If possible, failed login sessions must be terminated and ac
count locked after 
three to five unsuccessful tries
 
 
Where possible, concurrent logins must be limited to one

all aim to shift the local hosting and management of IT 
Services 

from on
-site to the cloud. The combination of these services is known as the Cloud 
Services Stack, and each service fulfills its own role in replacing an on
-site solution 
with a cloud based o
ne.
  [
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 refers to the fundamental building blocks of 
Cloud Services. IaaS offers an alternative to locally owned and hosted servers, and 

users of an IaaS service can build a ﬁvirtual datacenterﬂ that has access to many of 

the same resources as a traditional datac
enter without the large upfront investment 
and space constraints. IaaS is the ﬁlowest levelﬂ of the Cloud Services stack, and acts 
as the ﬁfoundationﬂ for all the other segments of cloud services. Examples of IaaS 
would include Amazon Web Services (AWS), M
icrosoft Azure, and Google Cloud 
Platform (GCP).
  [Platform as a S
ervice (PaaS)
 is one level above IaaS in the Cloud Services stack. A 
PaaS solution would provide the environment for which the service or program will 
run, such as the operating system and al
l necessary software. PaaS is built on top of 
virtualization technology, which enables efficient hosting and on
-demand scaling. 
IaaS is strictly concerned with hardware and storage devices and PaaS consists of 
virtual machines that are already loaded with 
all necessary operating systems and 
supporting software. Some examples of PaaS include Cloud Foundry, Google App 
Engine, and Microsoft Azure.
  [Software as a Service (SaaS)
 is the highest level of the Cloud Services stack and 
includes pre
-packaged software 
that the University licenses directly from a vendor. 
Typically
, the university accesses the application via a web browser.
 SaaS is the 
highest level of the Cloud Services stack, and moves the task of managing and 
deploying software to a third
-party service
. Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, 
Google Docs, and cloud storage portals like Box or Dropbox. Using SaaS means the 
customer is not responsible for hosting, updating, or troubleshooting the software, 

as it is supplied, ready
-for

ouncil effective April 
8, 2005.  [This is an 
update to the version passed 
by the Marshall University 
Board of Governors on March 8, 
2006. 2 Policy:
 2.1 Introduction
 Marshall University is an academic community
 dedicated to creating and maintaining an 
environment for learning that promotes re
spect for and apprecia
tion of scholarship, 
freedom, and human diversity. In keeping with this commitment, Marshall University 

makes certain University computing resources
 are available to faculty, staff, and 
students. These resources incl
ude educational, research, 
and communication facilities, 
disk storage, and selected so
ftware. Access to and usage of
 these facilities is a public 

trust; and certain expectations, responsibiliti
es and requirements ar
e inherent to this 
trust. Access to these finite resources is a pr
ivilege and is provided with an expectation 
of responsible and acceptable use. In additi
on to the principles and guidelines provided 
in this policy, institu
tional policies along with certain fede
ral, state and local regulations 
apply to the use of the Informa
tion Technology Environment (ITE). 
2.2 General Principles and Guidelines
 The basic premise of this policy is that re
sponsible and acceptable 
use of the Marshall 
University ITE does not extend to whatever 
an individual is capable of doing. Instead, 
certain principles provide a guide to users re
garding responsible and 
acceptable behaviors 
and users are responsible 
for knowing and understanding th
em. These principles and 
guidelines include, but are not limited to: 
2.2.1 The Marshall University ITE was funded
 and developed for th
e sole purpose of 
promoting and supporting the 
mission of the University. 
2.2.2 Authorized users of the Ma
rshall University ITE, or 
University sponsored remote 
resources, are those individua
ls who have been granted a 
username and password. The 
username and password combina
tion is your identity and li
cense to access and use the 
components of the Marshall Un
iversity ITE for which you are specifically authorized. 
 2.2.3 Authorized users will abide 
by institutional policies along wi
th applicable local, state 
and federal regulations. 
2.2.4 The resources of the Marshall University 
ITE are finite and shared.  [Appropriate and 
responsible use of these res
ources must be cons
istent with the common good. The ITE 
may NOT be used for commerc
ial or profit-making purposes. 
2.2.5 The University reserves the right to lim
it access to the Marshall University ITE when 
investigating cases of suspected abuse 
or when violations
 have occurred. 
2.2.6 The University does not monitor 
or generally restrict the cont
ent of material stored on or 
transferred through the compone
nts of the ITE. Use of the 
ITE is a privilege and not a 
public forum, therefore the University reserves 
the right to restrict or deny usage of the 
ITE when such usage does not promote or
 support the mission of the University. 
2.2.7 Users must adhere to the et
hical standards governing copy
right, software licensing, and 
intellectual property. 
2.2.8 Personal web pages may NOT contain th
e official Marshall University logo. 
2.2.9 "Mass Mailings" are defined as excessive, 
unauthorized, and frivol
ous mailings of two 
hundred or more identical or nearly identical 
pieces of electronic co
mmunication sent by 
user or users to other email 
or voice recipients 
and are not allowed w
ithout approval. The details for appr

2.3 Enforcement
 Violation of these guidelines constitutes un
acceptable use of inform
ation resources, and 
may violate other University policies and/or
 state and federal law. Suspected or known 
violations should be reported to the Office of the Senior Vice President for Information 

Technology/CIO. The appropriate 
University authorities and/or
 law enforcement agencies 
will process violations. Violations may re
sult in revocation of computing resource 
privileges, academic dishonesty or Honor C
ouncil proceedings, faculty, staff or student 
disciplinary action, 
or legal action. 
The maintenance, operation, and security of
 computing resources 
require responsible 
University personnel to
 monitor and access the system. 
To the extent possible in the 
electronic environment and in a public setting, a user's privacy will be preserved. 

Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to the West Virginia Access to Public Records Act, 

other applicable state and fe
deral laws, and the needs of the University to meet its 
administrative, business,
 and legal obligations.

! - "#UNIVERSITY POLICY ON RESPONSIBLE USE OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
(A)Purpose. Access to modern information technology is essential to Kent state
university's mission of providing the students, faculty and sta
! with educationalservices of the highest quality. The pursuit of the missions of teaching, research
and public service is greatly enhanced by the use of computing systems and
software, access to the world wide web, and other technology resources that are
available to the entire campus community. The preservation of those resources for
the community requires that each faculty member, sta
! member, student or other
authorized user comply with institutional policies, applicable federal and state
laws and responsible use of technical resources.
(B)Operational procedure.
(#)Authorized users of campus computing and network resources shall be
faculty, sta
!, student and other a"liated individuals or organizations
authorized by the vice president for information services.
($)Notwithstanding the geographical location of the user, authorized use of
campus-owned or operated computing and network resources shall be
consistent with the teaching, research and public service mission of Kent
state university and consistent with this policy.
(%)Information technology provides important means for both public and
private communication. Users and systems administrators shall respect the
privacy of person-to-person communications in all forms includingtelephone, electronic mail and Þle transfers, graphics and television to the
fullest extent possible under applicable law and policy. The principle of
academic freedom shall apply to public communication in all these forms of
communication, as well as in the transmission of information in both the
physical and virtual classrooms, subject to the limitations set forth
hereinafter.
(&)Subject to requirements of network administration, Kent state university

shall not monitor or restrict the content of material posted on university-
owned computers, or transported across its networks. However, Kent state
university reserves the right to:
(a)Limit access to its networks; and(b)Remove or limit access to content or to material residing on or
transmitted on university-owned computers or networks when exigent
circumstances arise (i.e., evidence of a reported violation of applicable
university policies, contractual).
(')Determination of violations shall be made in accordance with established
applicable due process procedures (i.e., student code of conduct, collective
bargaining agreement, academic and administrative grievances and appeals
policies, as appropriate).
(()In the normal course of system maintenance, both preventative and
troubleshooting, sta
! members operating the computer systems may be
required to view Þles. Sta
! shall be required to maintain the conÞdentiality
and privacy of information in such Þles unless otherwise required by law or
university policy.
())Kent state university reserves the right, upon reasonable cause for
suspicion, to access all aspects of its computing systems and networks,including individual login sessions to determine if a user is violating thispolicy or state or federal laws.
(*)This policy may be supplemented with additional guidelines or regulations
developed by units and companies that operate their own computers or
networks, provided they are consistent with this policy.
(!)A university member who stores or distributes copyrighted material must
be the copyright holder or have the permission of the copyright holder asrequired under law. This includes duplication of audiotapes, videotapes,
photographs, illustrations, computer software, and all other information for
educational use or any other purpose.(#")No user may, under any circumstances, use Kent state university computing
equipment, software or networks to harass or defame any other person.

(#)Access. The university recognizes the private nature of electronic mail
communications. The university may access such Þles in the course of itsnormal supervision of the network or system (i.e., backing up of electronic
messaging material), or when exigent circumstances arise (i.e., evidence of
reported violations of policies or laws). Accordingly, the private nature of
electronic mail communications sent or received by users on any computer
system owned or operated by the university shall be maintained, subject to
the technology limitations of the university's electronic systems and in a
manner consistent with university polices, state and federal laws.
($)Public records request. From time to time the university may receive
requests pursuant to section 
$()
.
(' of the Revised Code (the Ohio PublicRecords Act). When such requests are for access to a user's e-mail Þles, the
university will make a good faith e
!ort to notify the a!ected user. A good faith
e!ort may include, though not be limited to, an e-mail message sent to the
a!ected user's university e-mail address or telephone notice, including a
message left on the university-based voice mail system.
(%)Security. Kent state university employs various measures to protect the
security of its computing resources and its users' accounts. Users should be
aware, however, that the university cannot guarantee the absolute security
and privacy of data stored on university computing facilities. Users should
therefore engage in safe computing practices including but not limited to
establishing appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding their
passwords, changing them regularly, and by backing up critical Þles when
appropriate.

 STATEMENT:
 All who have access to use a
 networked university 
Multi
-Function Devices (MFD) 
have the 
responsibility to ensure the overall security of the data and 
documents 
it processes.  [
Members of 
the university using or administering MFDs should comply 
with the Data Classification and 
Protection policy (4
-008) and the standards set forth in this document.  [ 
BACKGROUND:
 The University of Central Florida has a need to 
centralize
 network capable 
MFD
s throughout the 
campus as a way of reducing the need f
or multiple devices, 
realizing cost savings, 
ease of use, 
less
ening our impact on the environment, and improving 
efficiencies of process. MFDs provide 

great value to the university, but also raise security concerns when not properly configured. 

Securing networked devices is important for a number of reasons: 
Most are simply ﬁplugged
-inﬂ to the network using the minimal settings required to make
the device operate.
Once installed, they rarely receive recommended updates and patches.
Administration of MFDs 
takes place on the network; physical access to the device may

not be required.
Due to increased sophistication (built-
in ﬁintelligenceﬂ) and ever
-increasing storage
capacity, hackers use MFDs to launch attacks, store unauthorized data, retrieve scanned
and printed documents, and print 
unauthorized material.
This Information Security Office (ISO)
 sets the minimum acceptable security standards required 
for
 attaching
 and deploying any MFD to the 
UCF 
network while 
providing for maximum 
security, 
efficiency
, ava

 OverviewThis policy establishes general guidelines and procedures by which to assure economy and efficiency in
the identification, retention, retrieval, preservation, and destruction of university records in compliance
with state and federal regulations.
A.
Authority and history
According to division (B) of section 149.33 of the Revised Code, the boards of trustees of state-
supported institutions of higher education shall have full responsibility for establishing and
administering records programs for their respective institutions. The boards shall apply efficient and
economical management methods to the creation, utilization, maintenance, retention, preservation, and
disposition of the records of their respective institutions.
Resolution 1992-1218 of the Ohio university board of trustees empowers the president of the university
to appoint a standing university records committee "which shall be responsible for actions regarding the
university's records management policies and procedures." The same resolution authorized a
"university-wide records management policy which shall oversee the creation, maintenance, and
disposition of all records in units and sub-units of the university."
In keeping with that resolution, the university records committee has directed "provision for the
equipping and professional staffing of the records management office," which, it charged, "shall monitor
the creation, maintenance, and disposition of university records throughout the system."
Each planning unit head, or his or her designee, who oversees custody of university records is,
therefore, responsible for consulting the university archivist and records manager to establish and
maintain compliance with current records retention guidelines specific to records that are created or
received by their office.
The university records committee also recognized the Ohio university archives "as the official repository
for Ohio university records of enduring and permanent value," and the committee established a records
storage facility "to hold records during their inactive phase, prior to disposal or transfer to the
archives."
B.Definitions and legal requirements
University records and public access to them are defined and explained under policy 
40.007.All questions about laws related to public requests for access to university records should be directed to
the university's office of legal affairs.
C.Records retention manual
The manual titled "Records Retention for Public Colleges and Universities in Ohio," represents the work
of a special committee of the inter-university council of Ohio in consultation with an international
records specialist. 
This manual shall be used by the university records manager as the basic guideline
for determining the legal retention periods for university records. 
If, in the future, the inter-university
council of Ohio updates the most recent records retention manual or creates or adopts a different
manual, such new manual shall be used by the university records manager for determining legal
retention periods for university records.
D.Process
The establishment of a centralized records management office is necessary to ensure the university's
consistent compliance with state and federal records retention requirements and to facilitate removal,
storage, and destruction or preservation of university records. Therefore, the person designated as the
university records manager, guided by the recommendations of the records retention manual, is
E.
authorized by the Ohio university board of trustees to determine the disposition of university records.
Issues of the disposition of university records and subsequent removal, storage, and destruction or
preservation of those records shall be determined in the manner established by parts 
(F) to (L)
 of this
policy.
University records committee
The university records committee serves two roles: 
it provides specific oversight for this policy and it is
the policy area committee ("PAC") for data handling, including university data classification according to
sensitivity. 
Other policies (in preparation) will address the general role of information technology PACs
and the other specific roles of this committee.
The university records committee is a standing committee, and so will be staffed through the committee
on committees process. 
The committee will be chaired by the chief information officer. 
It will include the
university records manager and the following people (or someone designated by each of them):
The committee shall seek advice from and provide advice to the university records manager; provide
interpretation of this policy, as needed; recommend changes to this policy, as needed; review and
provide feedback on the electronic records guidelines published by the office of information technology
(see part 
(L)
 of this policy); and identify other opportunities to improve the handling of university
records.

14.Records retention
G.
All staff of the university whose regular or occasional performance of functions involves creating,
receiving, or maintaining files, records, or documents pertaining to the duties and functions of their
offices are required to observe the following:
Records that document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, 
procedures, operations, or
other official activities of university offices and 
personnel are the property of Ohio university and
the state of Ohio.
1.Such property is not to be permanently removed or destroyed except in accordance with the
schedule for that unit as approved by:
2.The administrator in charge of the area in which the records are 
generated or received;
anda.The university records manager.
b.The head of each planning unit or his or her designee will determine in conjunction with the
university records manager the appropriate retention periods for the records series that are
created, received, or maintained by their respective units.
3.Inventories and schedules for university records
It shall be the responsibility of each planning unit head or his or her designee, with guidance and
approval of the university records manager, to conduct records inventories and analyses and to
establish the official records retention schedules for their respective units. This shall be done in the
following manner:
H.Each planning unit that generates, receives, or maintains university records shall complete and
maintain up to date an inventory of their various series of records including such information as
the names of the records series, descriptions of the purposes for each series, and the date(s) of
each series.
1.Each planning unit, using the records retention manual as a guide, shall then submit to the
university records manager for approval a draft schedule for the retention and disposition of each
records series thusly inventoried.
2.Once the draft schedule is approved and signed by the university records manager and by the
head of the planning unit that has provided the draft proposal, a final records retention schedule
shall be produced for that unit by the university records manager.
3.Removal and storage of university records
I.Records for which retention dates have been officially scheduled shall be retained until such time
as their retention dates have been reached. The university records manager may provide space
on a limited basis at a safe, secure records storage facility where units may store records that
have not yet reached their scheduled expiration dates. Records maintenance personnel from each
unit that is granted permission to transfer records from their unit to the records storage facility
must generate and maintain a complete inventory of the records that they are transferring to the
storage facility, and they must provide a copy of the inventory to the university records manager.
The records manager will provide records storage boxes to the units transferring records, and the
records generating unit will be responsible for packing the boxes and labeling those boxes so that
the contents of each box may be easily identified for retrieval or destruction.
1.
Some records, which have longer or permanent retention periods, also may be stored on a
limited basis at the records storage facility with the approval of the university records manager,
who may first require the unit to make arrangements to have those records more appropriately
preserved; see part 
(J)
 ("Preservation of University Records") of this policy.
2.Records that have been transferred to the records storage facility are still considered to be the
property of the offices from which they have been transferred, and requests to the university
records manager for retrievals of copies of those records or for retrievals of the original records
in full or in part may be made by the offices from which the records were sent for storage. No
record(s) shall be retrieved or reproduced from the storage facility at the request of anyone other
than the records maintaining personnel or administrators of the offices from which those records
were originally transferred unless permission is otherwise granted by the office from which the
record(s) were transferred, except in cases of official university investigation, responding to
requests from the office of legal affairs, or for audit purposes.
3.Preservation of university records
J.Records that have been identified in the schedule as "archival" for their enduring historical value
may be transferred to the university archives upon the approval of the university archivist. 
Theuniversity archivist may supply standard size records boxes for units that are preparing to send
records to the archives. University records and the boxes in which they are transferred to the
archives shall be clearly identified and labeled before transfer, and units transferring records to
the archives shall supply the archives with a complete inventory of the records being transferred.
1.Records that are transferred to university archives (located in Alden library) become the
administrative responsibility of the archives, and, unless otherwise stipulated by agreement, such
records shall reside permanently in the archives. Most university records housed in the archives
are subject to unrestricted public access. The relatively few series of archived university records
to which access is legally restricted may be examined by staff from the office of origin of those
records upon the request of the administrator of that office and in agreement with the university
archivist.
2.In order to help guarantee the preservation, integrity, and security of records that have been
turned over to the archives, access to records housed in the archives -- whether by the general
public or by university staff -- shall be on-premise only. Archive staff may agree to photocopy or
scan records for a fee if the condition and integrity of the original records will not be in any way
damaged or otherwise altered during the process of placing them on scanners or photocopiers.
3.Section 9.01 of the Revised Code authorizes microfilming the records of public offices for the
purpose of preserving them or for the purpose of conserving space. The office of the university
archivist and records manager therefore urges units that generate large amounts of paper
records that have been determined to be of enduring administrative, legal, or historical value to
make arrangements to have such records microfilmed. Although digitizing (scanning) has become
a convenient way by which to maintain and access records that are retained over shorter periods,
microfilming is still the safest, most secure, and most durable means of preserving records that
must be retained more permanently. The university records manager shall, upon request, supply
units with information concerning microfilming.
4.Disposal of university records
K.When a unit head or his or her designee has determined by the retention schedule that records
within their unit have reached or have exceeded the legal retention period, and that the records
have no further administrative, legal, or historical value, the administrative head of the unit shall
1.
arrange for the disposal of those records.
Upon the disposal of records, the head of the unit shall sign and maintain appropriate records
documenting such information as title, contents, and purpose of the disposed records, legal
retention period, as well as date and method of disposal.
2.When the university records manager is to oversee the removal and destruction of records that
have reached their retention period from the off-site storage facility, as identified in part 
(I) ofthis policy, the university records manager shall first inform the responsible unit, in writing, of his
or her intent to destroy those records, preserving a copy of that notice and of the subsequent
reply from the unit acknowledging and consenting to the destruction of the records.
3.Records that contain materials that are of a confidential nature -- especially but not exclusively
those records that are included under FERPA or HIPAA stipulations -- shall be destroyed in a
manner consistent with best practices to reasonably ensure that the data is not recoverable.
4.Some less-formal records that have shorter-lived administrative or legal value are categorized as
"transitory." Retention periods for transitory records are usually event-driven, rather than being a
fixed period of time. Examples of transitory records include preliminary drafts and notes, used in
the production of university records, which are proper to dispose of when those drafts or notes
have been superseded or updated by other records; policies and procedures documents that
have been superseded or withdrawn (university archives shall, and other offices may, retain
copies of superseded and withdrawn policies); voice mail; and records relating to scheduling
meetings and other non-public events. Such records should be retained until they are no longer
of administrative or legal value and may then be destroyed, deleted, or purged at any time
without acknowledgement or approval of the university records manager. For further advice as to
whether a record should be classified as transitory or not, please contact the university records
manager.
5.Retention and disposal guidelines for electronic records
L.Electronic records, including electronic mail (e-mail) messages and personal computer disk files,
that document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of a university office shall be considered records in accordance with the Revised Code
definition of records. 
(For examples of electronic records that are not considered to be university
records see the next paragraph of this part (L)(1) of this policy.) Therefore, all such electronic
records that are generated or received by university offices shall fall under all of the regulations
established by the federal and state law, and shall be subject to the university policies and
procedures for records retention and disposal as outlined previously in this document. For
example, the retention period for requisitions that are created or received electronically by a
university office shall be the same as the retention period for those requisitions that are
generated or received on paper or in any other fixed medium.
Examples of electronic records that would not fit the criteria for public records as defined by the
Revised Code would be e-mail messages of a personal nature that do not pertain in any way to
the conducting of university business, even though they were received on university e-mail
systems, and messages received from interest-group listservs. These types of records, generally
categorized as transitory, may be deleted or purged at any time.

electronic mail online at

POLICY:
 
 
Central Michigan University
 
provides 
its faculty, staff, and students with the means to communicate electronically with 
others, and it is the policy of CMU to exercise exclusive management rights to the methods and means of such 
communication.  [No faculty member, staff member, or student may 
develop and/or use an electronic mailing list or otherwise 
communicate electronically in a fashion inconsistent with the purposes and procedures 
that 
are described below in this 
document.  [These procedures 
articulate the audiences to which CMU students and
 
employees may freely communicate
 
using 
CMU digital communication resources 
and identifies ways that CMU students and employees might communicate with those 
audiences to which they, through this same policy, would not ordinarily have access.
  [
 
 
This policy
 

specific audiences are encouraged to develop internal policies, procedures, and/or guidelines to govern communications to 
their audience(s).
 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
 
CMU recognizes the efficiency of employing digital communications among its students and employees.  [Digital 
communication saves time, saves money, and is often the fastest, most effective method of communication among members 
of the CMU com
munity.  [At the same time, digital communications can easily be abused, and an email that seems useful and 

sometimes troublesome, t
he real issue emerges with regard to bulk or group communications, and it is this type of 
communication to which this policy specifically refers. 
 
 
PROCEDURES:
 
 
Part I:  [Opportunities for the CMU student or employee to employ digital communications
 
 
Any fa
culty member, staff member, or student may develop a mailing list or otherwise communicate electronically 

supervisory, collaborative, or instructi
onal relationship.
  [
For example, a business officer may maintain a mailing list of 
her/his direct reports or the employees in her/his division or department, a faculty member may maintain a mailing list of th
e 
students in each of her/his classes or a lists
erv list of her/his advisees, or a committee chair may develop a SharePoint site or 
WebEx room for the use of members of her/his committee. The CMU Help Desk (989.774.3662) is available to provide 
assistance with the various forms of digital communication 
available to CMU faculty, staff, and students.

INTRODUCTION
 
( Purpose and Intent)
 
Advances in technology have enabled the implementation of a substantial number of 
computer
-
based application systems by the University of South Florida System (USF 
System) campuses, colleges, departments and entities.  [In some cases, these applications hav
e 
become critical to the operation of the organization and the USF System.  [It is essential, 
therefore, that adequate measures be used to protect the integrity and reliability of those 
computing systems and the USF System
 
data they process.
 
The purpose of 
this policy is to help USF System
 
units maintain the confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of their information technology resources by establishing a basic set of 
minimum standards for management, use, and protection.
 
 
II.
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Information tech
nology (IT) resources shall be interpreted to include all USF System
 
computing and telecommunications facilities, equipment, hardware, software, data, systems, 
networks and services which are used for the support of teaching, research and 
administrative ac
tivities of the USF System.
 
A USF System Unit consists of any College, Department, Research Center, Institute, Direct 
Support Organization, or other administrative subdivisions that are connected to the 
University of South Florida System network.
 
 
III.
 
SCOPE
 
This policy applies to all IT resources, persons and entities connected to the USF System 
network and include the hardware, software, and USF System
 
data used in these 
environments, except for specific entities who operate under additional federal regulati
ons 
that would not normally be applicable to an educational environment.  [These areas may 
include clinical healthcare or clinical research, where federal regulation mandates an even 

more stringent and different security structure.  [Even in these cases, rea
sonable efforts 
should be made to follow the spirit of USF System
 
policy.
 
 
IV.
 
STATEMENT OF POLICY 
 

 
All USF System
 
information security policies, standards, guidelines and practices shall be 
coordinated through the Office of Information Security 
and shall be consistent with a USF 
System
-
wide approach in developing, implementing and managing data, system, and network 
security.
 

 
ability to conduct its business extends beyond basic 
procedures for handling, storing an
d disposing of information.  [Each USF System
 
unit must 
ensure a level of protection not only appropriate for computers and networks  [in its own 
environment but also with regard to the level of protection used for the larger campus 
networks of which they ar
e a part. 
 
The University of South Florida is a System of higher education composed of multiple 
campuses and separately accredited institutions located in Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota
-
Manatee. Regional campuses and separately accredited institutions may
 
have unique 
characteristics.  [Students, faculty, and staff must check with their individual campuses and 
apply System
-
wide policies in conjunction and consistent with the specific characteristics and 
guidelines applicable to those campuses.  [Notwithstandi
ng, this policy is intended to set 
minimum guidelines for the entire USF System.  [Regional campuses, separately accredited 
institutions and administrative offices may not adopt less restrictive standards than the ones 
outlined in this policy. The CTO or eq
uivalent head of IT department in each campus shall 
be responsible for initiating the implementation of the provisions of this policy in his or her 
respective area.
 
 
A.  [Management and Access Controls 
 
Each IT resource shall have a designee who is responsible for its security and 
management.  [The designee will be responsible for following and implementing 
standards and guidelines for system management as established and maintained by the 
Information Secu
rity Workgroup (ISW), as defined in 
USF System
 
Policy 0
-
508
, and 
published on the USF System Security Website, 
http://www.usf.edu/it/about
-
us/policies
-
and
-
standards.aspx
.
 
According to 
USF System Policy 0
-
515
, Protection of Electronic Personal 
Information, 
access to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) shall be granted only when required by 
official USF System
 
business. When granted, access shall be closely monitored by the 
data owners, data custodians and the Office of Information Security, 
following the 
standards established by 
USF Policy 0
-
515
 
and supplemental standards and guidelines 

posted on the USF System Security website. Access reviews sho
uld be done at least 
annually to verify that owners/supervisors validate the user level of access and the 
changes effected. 
 
Each authorized user of a system shall have a unique login ID.  [Any ID which is used to 
access a system, and which does not provide
 
a unique user identification, shall have 
access only to specific, restricted system resources. Access to services and/or resources 
will be suspended, and the appropriate account deleted when there is no longer a 
business or academic need for access. Emplo
yees are required to remove any personal 
data from USF computer systems prior to their last day at USF. The deprovisioning of 
the account will be performed in a manner proportionate to the level of risk posed by 
such access, including immediate suspension 
of access and privileges and deletion of the 
account if necessary. 
 
It is the responsibility of each user to understand the retention requirements put upon 
the data they store on IT systems by State and Federal Law. In case of employee 
termination, that re


duplicate files stored in network drives on to another network share and make these files 
available to t
he new departmental data owner. By default, IT will keep email, calendar, 
and network share files for a period of one (1) year, at the end of which the files will be 
purged from the system.
 
Access control procedures shall be used to authenticate all users 
who access each system.  [
Such controls shall include, at a minimum, a login ID and a response mechanism (such 
as a password) for each user.  [
All user accounts
 
shall be 
required 
to 
change 
passwords
 
periodically.  [The frequency should be determined by the enforced length and 
complexity of the
 
password 
combined 
with 
the sensitivity of the data protected, in 
accordance with industry 
standards and guidelines 
published in 
the 
security website.
 
Login IDs 
with supervisor or root privileges shall be highly secured.  [Such IDs shall be 
reserved for system management tasks and shall not be used as the IDs for routine 
system access.
 
Access rights and privileges for all authorized users shall be maintained and ma
naged so 
as to secure access to data in a manner appropriate to the needs of the user and the value 
of the data.  [Confidential data shall be protected against unauthorized access regardless 
of form, computing environment or location.
 
B.  [Software Managemen
t
 
Appropriate procedures shall be established and documented for the management of 
computer and system software.  [These procedures shall address the processes by which 
such software is acquired, installed, tested, documented, changed, and maintained.
 
Where
 
justifiable, and when it benefits the University, procedures shall be established 

and maintained to allow for the installation of employee legally
-
owned software.  [
Employee
-
owned software must be removed from USF System
 
equipment when the 
equipment is no 
longer being used by that employee, or upon that employee's 
termination of employment with the unit or the USF System.  [
 
At the time of termination of employment from a unit or from the USF System, the 
employee being terminated shall certify as part of the
 
unit's termination processing that 
all USF System
 
software has been removed from the employee's personally
-
owned home 
equipment and that all original software media or copies have been returned to the USF 
System.
 
Procedures shall be established for the ma
nagement of proprietary software purchased 
for an employee's use in a telecommuting arrangement.
 
USF licensed software shall be 
removed from any non
-
 
USF System
 
equipment at the conclusion of the telecommuting 
arrangement or at the termination of employmen
t with a unit or with the USF System.
 
C.  [Data Backup
 
System Administrators shall carry out the procedures for backup of systems data and 
software.  [Effective backup procedures shall be maintained for the data and software 
residing on systems according to 
the ISW standards.  [Procedures shall also address 
periodic testing to ensure the ability to 
 
successfully restore data from these backups.  [Backup systems shall not be used as 
archiving for record retention purposes.  [The goal of these systems is to protec
t USF 
System
 
data, allowing recovery in the case of a disaster.
 
Backups shall be stored in a secured area that would not be subject to the same 
disruption of services as the location where the system is located.  [Backups of data 
considered mission
-
critical
 
to the operation of the unit shall also be maintained in an 
alternate location.  [USF System units using backup services must ensure that appropriate 
measures are taken to preserve the confidentiality of the data as specified by industry 
standards and the 
standards published on the Security Website, 
http://www.usf.edu/it/about
-
us/policies
-
and

of critical services in the event of a significant disruption of normal computer and system 

operations.  [These shall include plans for interim manual processing, as well 
as plans for 
resuming operations in an alternate location should that be necessary to maintain the 
mission
-
critical functions of the unit.  [These plans shall address areas such as a 
replacement of hardware and software, restoration of data, relocation of p
ersonnel and 
so on, as appropriate to the needs of the unit.
 
E.  [Awareness and Training
 
A robust and enterprise wide awareness and training program is paramount to 
understanding IT security responsibilities, organizational policies, and how to use and 
prot
ect the entrusted IT resources in a proper manner.  [
The program shall ensure that all 
individuals are appropriately trained in how to fulfill their security responsibilities.  [Such 
training shall provide employees with the rules of the system and apprise t
hem of 
available assistance, security products, and techniques. Behavior consistent with the rules 
of the system and periodic retraining shall be required for continued access to the 
University systems.
 
F.  [Physical Security 
 
Procedures shall be developed 
and maintained for protecting computer equipment and 
components from theft and physical damage.  [Equipment shall be located only in areas 
that have sufficient physical access controls and are already properly protected; critical 
servers shall be in a secur
e area designated by IT as a Data Center, with access permitted 
only by authorized persons. Due to the duties they perform it may be necessary to house 
servers related to network operations outside the Data Center. The Infrastructure group

Eligibility
 
 
In
 
general,
 
access
 
to
 
computing
 
resources
 
is
 
provided
 
to
 
the
 
following groups:
 
 

 
Active
 
faculty,
 
staff,
 
and
 
students
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
University
 
operations
 
and
 
initiatives.
 
The
 
eligibility
 
of
 
these
 
individuals
 
to
 
access
 
computing
 
resources
 
may
 
be
 
tested
 
automatically
 
and
 
periodically
 
against
 
University
 
records.
 
Other
 
sources
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
where
 
these
 
databases
 
do
 
not
 
accurately
 
reflect 
an
 
ongoing 
affiliation.
 

 
Persons
 
not
 
affiliated
 
with
 
LSU
 
engaged
 
in
 
research
 
or
 
support
 
of
 
University
 
operations
 
or
 
University
 
supported
 
initiatives.
 
The
 
eligibility
 
of
 
these
 
individuals
 
to
 
access
 
computing
 
resources
 
and/or
 
data
 
requires
 
initial
 
and
 
periodic
 
verification
 
of
 
need
 
 
by 
 
a 
 
Dean,
 
 
Department
 
 
Head,
 
 
or
 
Director.
 
Requests
 
must
 
be
 
accompanied
 
by
 
the
 
reason
 
for
 
the
 
access,
 
the
 
name
 
and
 
contact
 
information
 
of
 
the
 
sponsoring
 
Dean,
 
Department
 
Head,
 
or 
Director,
 
and
 
the
 
length
 
of
 
time
 
for 
which
 
the
 
access
 
will
 
be 
required.
 

 
Access
 
to
 
computing
 
resources
 
by
 
retired
 
faculty
 
and
 
staff
 
is
 
a
 
recognized
 
benefit
 
to
 
the
 
University
 
community
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
providing
 
these
 
resources
 
is
 
economical
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
adversely
 
affect
 
the
 
 
operations
 
 
of
 
 
the
 
University.
 
This
 
statement
 
applies
 
primarily
 
to
 
electronic
 
mail
 
and
 
general
 
purpose
 
academic
 
or
 
research
 
systems.
 
In
 
the
 
event
 
that
 
resources
 
become
 
constrained,
 
this
 
practice
 
may
 
be
 
eliminated
 
or
 
restricted.
 
However,
 
the
 
University,
 
in
 
its
 
sole
 
discretion,
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
may
 
limit,
 
withdraw,
 
or
 
deny
 
access 
to
 
retired
 
faculty
 
and 
staff.
 
 
NOTE:
 
Colleges,
 
departments,
 
and
 
other
 
administrative
 
units

issue
 
local
 
technology
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures
 
that
 
support
 
their
 
organizational
 
missions
 
and
 
requirements.
 
Such
 
policies
 
may
 
be
 
more
 
restrictive
 
than
 
University
 
policy,
 
but
 
CAN
 
NOT
 
be
 
more
 
permissive.
 
All
 
local
