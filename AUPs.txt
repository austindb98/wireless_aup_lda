A wiki is a social software tool that allows all of the members of a community to jointly create, edit search and browse a dynamic database of information.
Wikis can be used for project documentation(planning a conference, starting a new program), creating an evolving and historical body of information about an event or location(orientation, alumni weekend, restaurant reviews, book club readings, etc.
developing an internal collection of information about processes(policies, procedures, knowledge base), sharing course materials co-created by faculty and students, and a myriad of other applications.
The key characteristic of a wiki is the ease with which community members can create, edit and access pages on the web.
For more information on how faculty can integrate wiki technology into their teaching and learning, visit the Oxy Academic Technologies page.
Oxypedia is a product of, by and for the Occidental College community, but much of the content is also viewable by the world.
The College provides wiki services to faculty, staff and students, and to other affiliated classes of individuals.
Broad and active participation is encouraged.
As a dynamic community resource, Oxypedia's success depends on the actions of all of the community members.
No attempt will be made to censor content, but pages will be removed and contributors may be barred from contributing if the content is not in compliance with local, state and federal laws and College policies.
Simple Rules of the Road Participate in a respectful and civil way.
Oxypedia is not a soapbox or battleground, but can be a forum for thoughtful presentation of various views on a topic.
See the Wikipedia page on Civility for additional information about respectful participation.
Use materials like pictures, music or other media that you have created or that you have the legal right to use.
See the Occidental policy on Copyright for guidance.
Do not add materials or text to Oxypedia if you are in doubt about its copyright status.
Collaboration involves more than one individual.
Oxypedia spaces are not for creating an individual web page or blog.
Make sure that content on all Oxypedia spaces adheres to Occidental College's Appropriate Use Policy.
Do not include any confidential or sensitive information in an Oxypedia space.
Take responsibility for Oxypedia's success by reporting pages that violate civility, copyright or appropriate use policies.

The internet and world wide web have proven to be an open marketplace and crossroads for commerce and communication of all types, both positive and negative.
Institutions, associations and the government have all weighed in on how to safely navigate the complicated online world.
For background information on the context in which these security measures have been implemented familiarize yourself with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act(FERPA) and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act(CALEA), along with copyright law and fair use.
The Ohio Wesleyan University data network, whether wired or wireless, is a private network.
There is no free access to the general public; guests must register with the library circulation desk or Information Services Help Desk and are provided limited access on an as-needed basis.
Expand the topics below to learn more.
Passwords The first line of defense against unauthorized access to any data network is a unique username and password for every authorized individual.
Anyone with an OWU username and password is personally responsible for all activity on their account, so it is important that you select and maintain your own personal password as a safeguard for your account.
Choose your password with care.
OWU passwords must be between 32 characters, and may contain letters, numbers and some punctuation marks.
For more information about OWU passwords, see the passwords page.
Link to this section of the page.
Student and Employee Responsibility OWU calls upon each user on campus students, faculty, and staff to exercise responsible behavior when using the computer network.
The University s network allows quick and easy downloading of internet files for scholarly work.
Please know that the downloading of unauthorized internet media files is a violation of the University s Computer Use Policy.
It also may be illegal.
See the Copyright and Fair Use LibGuide for additional information.
For more information, including policy documents, see the Security Best Practices page on our department website.

Wireless Security To ensure that the campus wireless network is secure and private it utilizes 128-bit encrypted WiFi Protected Access(WPA2 Enterprise) security over an 802.1X wireless network.
This means that any computer accessing the wireless network must have the correct configuration, including the proper server addresses, the proper certificate and the proper credentials.
Once connected to the wireless network, you must still register your computer by again entering your username and password to access the internet.
Find your operating system or device in the BishopNet submenu under Network above for connection instructions.
Link to this section of the page.
Mac Addresses Every computer that connects to any network is identified by a physical hardware address.
This Media Access Control(MAC) address identifies the particular network interface card(NIC) used by that connection.
So the wired(Ethernet) card will have one address while the wireless network card will have another.
These addresses along with whose computer they belong to are recorded by the university and used to identify every connection to our network.
Sometimes the registering of these addresses is an automated process, such as when students point a new computer to wif owu.edu, and at other times you must provide the MAC address to the help desk to register it, as necessary for all gaming systems.
Instructions on how to find the MAC address on your computer are available here.

Common Sense Malware Precautions Many computer viruses are spread via email, either as a file attachment or via a hyperlink within the email itself.
This is why it is important that you should not open any attachment that you are not expecting or click on any link you re not sure
If you receive an email attachment that you were not expecting, you should contact the sender to verify that they purposely sent you the attachment before you open
Also keep in mind that a large percentage of the virus warnings circulating via email are hoaxes.
Forwarding these bogus warnings takes time and computing resources and may cause unintended harm.
Before forwarding any virus warning, always verify the information through a trusted anti-virus resource, such as the McAfee Threat Center, or an urban legends reference site, such as Snopes.com.
When browsing the internet be cautious clicking any advertisement.
Many instances of malware spread attached to downloaded files or posing as a banner
Also pay attention to your browser s address bar, where you should see indication of site security, a lock icon or the base domain(www.whatever.com) in green.
And don t download content from untrusted sites.
Link to this section of the page.
Virus Protection It is mandatory that all Windows computers connecting to the OWU campus network have up-to-date virus protection currently running on them.
New viruses are being introduced every day.
Virus software must be constantly updated for it to be effective.
Ohio Wesleyan has a site license for Sophos antivirus software for university owned computers.
Students can download the Sophos home edition for free here: Sophos Home.
Link to this section of the page.
Spyware Protection Spyware is computer software that is installed surreptitiously on a personal computer to intercept or take partial control over the user s interaction, without the user s informed consent.
Unlike viruses, spyware does not directly spread itself to other computers.
Spyware often comes piggy-backed on other freely distributed software or disguises itself as something useful and legitimate like a web accelerator or even as anti-spyware.
Up-to-date and currently running anti-spyware software is also required to connect to the OWU network.
Many internet security providers include anti-spyware and protect against other malware in their scans.
Link to this section of the page.
Spam Protection Anyone who uses email is familiar with the scourge of spam.
Email spam is a costly problem for all organizations.
With OWU using BishopMail, Google provides spam protection instead of the University itself.
If you receive anything suspicious, click the Report Spam button that has an icon of an exclamation point inside a stop sign shape.

In this case, the entity will be responsible for the installation and maintenance of their installed communication system.
A Planning Document - Background and History - Scott Swartzentruber Introduction Wireless LANs are continuing to grow in popularity, particularly in enterprise environments that require or desire a high level of mobility.
In the education environment a number of colleges and universities have implemented wireless projects to provide enhanced mobility to their clientele and to extend their network into those areas that are not served well by traditional wired connections.
The first implementations of wireless at WCU have been in the area of research.
This research has been primarily the study of the practical application of wireless LAN technology in an educational setting.
A project designed to study the utility of handheld wireless devices in the classroom has seen the implementation of 15 wireless access points around campus in several academic and common spaces.
A more recent implementation has been the installation of 24 access points in Belk building by the Engineering Technology department to study the utility of wireless devices including ruggedized handheld devices and cordless IP telephones.
Technology Wireless networking is a rapidly changing technology.
All users of wireless technology must be aware of the risks inherent in deploying cutting-edge technology.
Complete functionality, adherence to standards, and interoperability are all areas in which wireless(or any other new technology) must be closely evaluated to insure a good return on the resources invested in their purchase and use As is the case with many information technologies today, several wireless technologies exist that do not work together.
The most common wireless technology standard in use today is IEEE 802.11b.
This standard defines a wireless network using direct sequence-spread spectrum allocation of the 2.4 Ghz ISM band and provides an 11 Mb/s shared connection to the users.
WCU s current wireless network is build to this standard and provides that greatest possible amount of interoperability available given today s technology.
Security On the wired network WCU has been able to control access by limiting physical access to the wired network.
Only those individuals associated with the university have access to a port on the network.
The broadcast nature of wireless precludes using physical controls as a means of limiting network access with means other than distance.
Privacy on the wired network has been protected by the nature of how traffic flows in the network.
Traffic that leaves one system is only seen by the intended recipient and can not easily be captured by a third party on the network.
The broadcast nature of the wireless network means that any traffic sent on the wireless network can be easily captured by a third party.
Limited security features built-in to the wireless standard are not sufficient to control access or ensure an equivalent level of security.
At this point WCU has implemented rudimentary access control by requiring all
wireless network users to register their devices.
There is currently no privacy capability on the WCU wireless network.
Some capabilities do exist in the market but none of them are applicable to all of the devices that we are currently using on the wireless network.
Spectrum The frequency that is used for the 802.11b wireless LAN is the FCC defined 2.4 Ghz Industrial/Scientific/Medical(ISM) band.
Other wireless technologies use a similar FCC defined band in the Ghz range.
It s important to note that this is a shared bandwidth with many other wireless devices(cordless phones and keyboards for example) using these same frequencies.
A Planning Document Positions and Policies - Controlled deployment Understand that wireless LAN technology is an enhancement to, not a replacement of, the wired network.
All wireless devices are considered to be network attached devices and their use is governed by WCU s policy #52 Acceptable use of Computers and Data Communications.
Focus future deployment efforts on those areas that would enhance desired mobility or those areas not easily connected via a wired network.
The Computer Center will provide consulting for those campus organizations contemplating wireless LAN implementations.
All infrastructure wireless devices will be managed and serviced by the Computer Center.
No deployment or purchase of wireless LAN devices without approval of the CIO or designee.
Academic use It is understood that certain departments will need to use wireless devices in an academic setting to educate students on the technology used.
Academic use of wireless devices( e.
the use of wireless devices to enhance the education of wireless technology) will take place in a controlled environment in coordination with the Computer Center.
Channels, frequencies, access controls, and other settings will be agreed upon by both the academic department and the Computer Center prior to deploying wireless units for academic use.
Ongoing management and maintenance of wireless equipment being used for academic purposes is the responsibility of the department using
Protect bandwidth The ISM bands in the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz range are reserved exclusively for wireless network use.
Other devices operating in these ranges(e.g.
cordless phones, cordless keyboards) can cause significant interference and are not to be used on the WCU campus.
If another device causes interference with the wireless LAN, Computer Center staff will work with the device owners to help eliminate or mitigate interference.
If the interference can not be mitigated or eliminated, priority will be given to wireless LAN access vs. other intended or accidental uses of the frequencies.
Insure interoperability Standardize on a single vendor for access points.
Standardize on a limited number of wireless cards for Computer Center staff to provide support
Once a list of current approved products is created it will be available by contacting the help-desk.
No sensitive traffic on the wireless network until security safeguards are put in place.
In this case sensitive traffic is defined as any traffic carrying data subject to FERPA, HIPPA, or any other federal, state, or local regulations limiting access to such data.
Access controls will be put in place to block non-secure access to local systems that contain sensitive data.
Access controls will be put in place to limit utilization of the wireless network to only authorized individuals.
Embrace goal of user centric authentication with all sensitive traffic protected with a single strong encryption method(e.g.
x, VPN, WPA, etc).
Implemented security methods will, at a minimum, protect sensitive data to the extent required by the regulation that calls for their protection(e.g.
FERPA for student data, HIPPA for medical data, etc) Devices that can not participate fully in the established security scheme will not have access to sensitive data.
All access and security controls will be approved by the CIO or designee.
Future Scalability Ensure selected vendors have plans to support future wireless standards and technologies.
Deploy wireless access points in such a way as to make best long-term use of wireless capabilities.
Exceptions Exceptions to these policies will be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the CIO or designee.

in an email!
A lot of the malware(viruses and spyware) contracted today are a result of these three common issues from emails, instant messengers, chat programs, and social networking websites such as Facebook or MySpace.
Unless you re waiting on and expecting an attachment or a link from someone DO NOT OPEN OR CLICK ON
This is a very common way for malware to spread.
Another common spreading tool involves pop-ups even if you aren t actually on the Internet.
These programs usually masquerade as legitimate software such as spyware or virus removal programs, registry cleaners, or codecs.
They make exaggerated claims about your computer safety so you will install them.
But they are, in fact, viruses and spyware!
Section Private Computers Connected to the University Network Prohibited Activities To maintain network performance, the conditions listed below are strictly prohibited.
Note that many of these activities are caused by inaction, not action Use of network for solicitations, commercial purposes, or any business activities for individuals, groups, or organizations Host data services for other people or groups Share the network connection beyond your own use Deceive others about your identity in electronic communication or network traffic Attempt to access accounts, files, or information belonging to other users without their knowledge and explicit consent Use your network connection to threaten, intimidate or harass others Use your network connection to engage in any form of illegal software sharing, file sharing, copying, or engaging in any way in other types of copyright infringement Any intentional or unintentional action that impairs the overall functions of the network Any intentional or unintentional action that would deny or impair network service to another system or user Any intentional or unintentional distribution of computer viruses and other malware Operation of unauthorized servers Operation of any service that makes unusually high demands of the network Any action that violates Federal, State or University policy or law Scanning any system(s) or network(s) other than the computer(s) registered to you Unauthorized installation of networking hardware(hub, router, wireless router) Modify or tamper with network services, wiring, and ports.

Description The University of Iowa maintains a robust and secure network that encompasses both wired ports and wireless access for devices.
The following policy is broken down into three sections that describe the management and operation of the network.
Unlicensed Radio Frequencies Wireless Networking Network Addressing Scope This policy affects any device located on University-owned or University-rented property, as well as any device that accesses, utilizes, or impacts University network resources.
Unlicensed Radio Frequencies Description In order to minimize potential interference with University of Iowa wireless services, the University must remove sources of interference when possible.
Additionally, the University needs to provide a central point of coordination for use of unlicensed radio frequencies to minimize interference and service disruptions related to the University mission.
This will assure the highest level of service for all members of the U of I campus community.
This policy asserts the right of the University to remove devices using publicly unlicensed bands that cause interference with University services, and to arbitrate between parties deploying their own services on the University campus.
The University of Iowa s wireless data networking service allows authorized users to access computing resources from mobile computing devices via radio frequencies in the ISM and U-NII bands.
In order to ensure the success of the wireless data networking service and other University services using ISM and U-NII radio frequencies, the University of Iowa needs the cooperation of all of its community members to minimize the number of devices that can cause radio interference and service disruption.
Policy Statement The Information Technology Services(ITS) department of the University reserves the right to restrict the use of all 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and GHz radio devices in University-owned buildings, University-rented spaces, and all outdoor spaces on the University of Iowa campus.
This may require the removal of equipment not sanctioned by ITS, including(but not limited to) some devices of the following types: cordless telephones, wireless microphones, wireless cameras, and network access points.
ITS will work with faculty, staff, students and volunteers to accommodate the use of devices for reasonable applications, such that they do not interfere with University delivered services, when possible.
If you would like to use devices that utilize these radio frequencies, you must first contact the Help Desk via email at its-helpdesk@uiowa.edu, to initiate the process of making an impact assessment.
Wireless Networking Description Provides guidance and procedures for the use of wireless networking technologies on the University of Iowa campus.
This policy addresses the use of IEEE 802.11 wireless data networking protocols, commonly known as Wi-F These protocols are used for connecting client devices to a data network through the use of over-the-air radio signals.
The primary advantages of wireless networks are mobility and flexibility.
The primary disadvantages are that wireless networks are more susceptible to service disruptions and resource exhaustion.
The phrase "Wi-Fi Service" in this document refers to the University of Iowa 802.11 wireless data networking service provided by Information Technology Services(ITS).
It refers to all components used to deliver Wi-Fi(physical and logical).
eduroam(education roaming) is a secure, world-wide Wi-Fi access service developed for the international research and education community.
Its purpose is to facilitate collaboration by allowing students, faculty, and staff to move between higher educational institutions while maintaining their ability to connect to Wi-F
eduroam is the primary Wi-Fi Service SSID provided to University students, faculty, and staff.
An eduroam service provider is an organization that advertises the eduroam SSID as a member of the international eduroam federation.
It is possible for an organization to be an eduroam service provider without becoming an eduroam identity provider.
The University of Iowa is an eduroam service provider, because it advertises the eduroam SSID.
An eduroam identity provider can create credentials that are valid for authenticating to an advertised eduroam SSID by any participating eduroam service provider.
The University of Iowa is an eduroam identity provider, because it defines credentials that authorize clients to use the eduroam SSID.
UI-Guest is a UI-supported wireless network service provided in a free-to-guest model, which means that users of the service are not required to pay for
SSID devoted to devices that cannot use authentication credentials.
Faculty, Staff and Students can register devices addresses to allow access to the campus network.
Policy Statements Access to eduroam will be restricted to clients that have valid eduroam credentials.
This includes current students, faculty, staff, and sponsored guests.
Additionally, this includes members of remote institutions that are registered eduroam identity providers, allowing peers and collaborators easy access to the University s Wi-Fi Service without client reconfiguration or provisioning guest credentials.
Students, faculty, and staff shall be authenticated with their Hawk ID for the eduroam network.
Sponsored guests must provision an ITS Guest ID which can be used to authenticate to eduroam.
Students, faculty, and staff should use the eduroam network when connecting devices to the Wi-Fi Service.
The eduroam network is not dependent on equipment administered by a third-party, has few access restrictions, and provides high throughput.
The eduroam network is also more reliable than UI-Guest.
ITS will provide authentication services for students, faculty, and staff when connecting to an eduroam SSID advertised by a remote eduroam service provider location.
This facilitates easy Wi-Fi access when traveling to other higher educational institutions.
The Wi-Fi Service shall provide best-effort protection of eduroam authentication credentials through the use of data encryption.
Internet of Thing devices have an option to connect to UI-DeviceNet.
Guests to the University of Iowa campus should use the UI-Guest network.
Guests who connect to the UI-Guest SSID must agree to our terms and conditions to be granted free access to the UI-Guest network.
The UI-Guest network is bandwidth constrained and does not allow access to several University resources.
Students, faculty, and staff are discouraged from connecting to the UI-Guest SSID.
Users of the Wi-Fi Service are responsible for obtaining a device that meets the current implementation requirements.
Appendix A contains a list of strings reserved for use by the University Wi-Fi Service.
Use of the strings is restricted regardless of upper or lower case letters.
Wi-Fi equipment in University owned or leased spaces that is not part of the University Wi-Fi Service shall not contain the restricted strings(in whole or in part) in their advertised SSIDs.
ITS reserves the right to revoke Wi-Fi Service authorization for an individual Hawk ID, Guest ID, or for any device that is disrupting the operation of the Wi-Fi Service.
Violation of the University of Iowa Network Citizenship policy or the Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources policy will result in revocation of authorization to use the Wi-Fi Service.
University students, faculty, staff, volunteers and guests shall not install wireless networking equipment in University owned or leased spaces without written consent from the Information Security and Policy Office.
Contact the Help Desk( its-helpdesk@uiowa.edu) for more information.
Wireless Networking Implementation Responsibility for implementing this policy rests with ITS.
ITS is responsible for designing, configuring, installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting the University of Iowa Wi-Fi Service.
ITS will maintain a written description of the current Wi-Fi Service implementation in the form of a service description.
ITS will provide a mechanism for procuring Guest ID's authorized to use the Wi-Fi Service.
ITS is authorized to monitor the implementation of unauthorized wireless devices.
ITS reserves the right to remove and/or disable wireless equipment that is in violation of this policy, and/or may disable any wired uplink data port associated with a device in violation of this policy.
For more information regarding the Wi-Fi service, please contact the ITS Help Desk( its-helpdesk@uiowa.edu).
Network Addressing Description This policy defines appropriate IP address use of global and other address ranges, with overall responsibility resting with Network Services of ITS.
The Network Services(NS) division of Information Technology Services(ITS) is responsible for planning, development, implementation and support of networking on the University main, research, and remote campuses, as well as other UI facilities.
Coordination in the use of Internet Protocol version(IPv4) and Internet Protocol version(IPv6) addresses is included in this responsibility.
The NS Hostmaster( hostmaster@uiowa.edu) is the service communication contact for requesting IPv4/IPv6 addresses and hostname reservations.
Globally(or Internet) routable IPv4 addresses are assigned by the Internet Address Numbering Authority(IANA) to regional registries for administration.
The American Registry for Internet Numbers(ARIN) is responsible for numbers assigned to North America.
IPv4 address ranges registered by the University of Iowa include: 128.255.0.0 128.255.255.255(128.255.0.0/16) 129.255.0.0 129.255.255.255(129.255.0.0/16) 198.49.182.0 198.49.182.255(198.49.182.0/24) Private IPv4 addresses.
IANA specifies IPv4 address ranges for use exclusively within a local network and cannot be assigned by a regional registry.
Commonly referred to by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) document RFC1918, these are not routed to the global Internet.
The IP address ranges specified in RFC1918 include: 10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255(10.0.0.0/8) 172.16.0.0 172.31.255.255(172.16.0.0/12) 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255(192.168.0.0/16) Public IPv6 addresses.
Globally(or Internet) routable IPv6 addresses are also assigned by IANA to regional registries for administration.
ARIN is responsible for numbers assigned to North America.
The IPv6 address range registered by the University of Iowa is 2620:0:e50:0:0:0:0:0 2620:0:e5f:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff(2620:0:e50::/48) IPv6 Unique Local Addresses(ULA).
IANA specifies IPv6 address ranges for use exclusively within a local network and cannot be assigned by a regional registry.
IETF document RFC4193 defines the IPv6 address ranges for use exclusively within an organization.
These addresses are not routed to the global Internet.
The full reserved range is fc00::/7.
The portion of that range reserved for self-assigning ULA prefixes is fd00::/8, and addresses in this range cannot be assigned by a regional registry.
Theoretically, organizations can locally define globally unique address ranges for internal use.
The purpose of this is to allow easier integration of private addresses when organizations merge networks together.
The ULA private address range defined by Network Services for use by the University of Iowa is: fd9a:2c75:7d0c:: fd9a:2c75:7d0c:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff(fd9a:2c75:7d0c::/48) Policy: Systems requiring reachability from the global Internet should be configured with public(global) IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
Individual or blocks of IPv4/IPv6 addresses not observed to be in use for a period of time, such as six months, are subject to be reclaimed and reassigned by NS with notice to the affected person, group, or place.
For use on University of Iowa networks, the 192.168.0.0/16 range of RFC1918 IP addresses is designated for use by system administrators on their local network without the coordination with NS Hostmaster, or monitoring or enforcement by
The 10.0.0.0/8 and 172.16.0.0/12 range of private RFC1918 IP addresses are reserved for campus-wide or inter-campus applications such as the UI Anywhere VPN service and site-local scope routing of private IP addresses.
Campus system administrators may elect to implement host access-controls based on network address, but are responsible for conforming to the address ranges defined in the policy, and changes in address ranges that may occur in the future.
Enforcement ITS will monitor the RF spectrum and network, and may disconnect devices that interfere with operations.

Follow these guidelines for students course Web pages: Web pages are to be designed to avoid consuming an unreasonable amount of bandwidth, disk space and CPU time, or interfering with the activity of other users To ensure stable operation of web services, usage limits will be established as needed, taking into consideration such factors as available resources, number of users, patterns of use, and expected growth in demand for this campus-wide service.
Due to network bandwidth constraints, students are not permitted to use their personal computers to serve web pages or to act as other types of servers.
The college reserves the right to edit the content and limit the size of any Bethany-hosted web pages.
ITS may also remove a page if it is in violation of this policy, other college policies, or found to be offensive.
Internet Filtering Policy Purpose and Scope Bethany Lutheran College has chosen to provide Internet services in order to facilitate access to information that is useful for students in achieving their academic goals and for faculty and staff who assist the students in fulfilling their goals.
As a reflection of the Bethany Lutheran College s mission statement, the College chooses to not provide resources that it believes to be contrary to the educational and spiritual mission of the College.
In the same manner in which the BLC Library selects resources for inclusion in its offerings based upon usefulness in fulfilling the academic mission of the College, Internet service is designed to offer a positive addition to the academic resources available to students, faculty and staff.
Just as some publications are not suitable for inclusion in the College library, some Internet sites are not suitable for access through the College network.
Review of Sites As the Internet is constantly growing and changing, the College does not claim the ability to monitor the content and quality of all sites.
We have chosen to limit access to certain categories of content that do not seem to have any inherent academic value and are likely to contain material at odds with the mission of the College.
Such distinctions are by definition subjective.
Some sites that are legitimate for academic research will inadvertently be blocked.
While it can block many categories, we currently have the following limited for our connection.
Illegal and/or adult content such as child and adult pornography is blocked.
Copyright-infringing and gambling sites are blocked.
Paper mill sites, which facilitate cheating, are blocked.
File sharing applications are limited in available bandwidth.
This is part of our compliance with the Higher Education Act.
Known virus, phishing, spyware and proxy sites are blocked.
Our Internet filter is managed by our staff.
If there is an obvious category of sites that are legitimate by College standards and are necessary for academic work at BLC, users should contact the Director of Information Technology or by the Dean of Students and request a review.
Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Peer-to-Peer file sharing(P2P) is prohibited on the campus network at Bethany Lutheran College.
This includes the illegal downloading or sharing of copyrighted materials, including music, games, and videos.
Our network management software is set to restrict bandwidth for known file sharing programs.
Any computer running P2P software will be blocked from campus network access until the software has been removed from the computer.
A Systems Administrator in IT must verify removal of the P2P software before network access is restored.
It is illegal.
Copyright Act and Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 prohibit the distribution or sharing of copyrighted work without the copyright owner s permission.
It is dangerous.
The peer-to-peer software that is used for file sharing may bypass your computer s operating system security and open your entire computer, along with your personal information, to anyone on the Internet.
It degrades our network performance.
Because it is the nature of these programs to share your files with as many computers as possible, the resulting volume of network traffic can slow down or disable our entire network.
The RIAA and other organizations have launched punitive lawsuits against both colleges and individual students over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, and we wish to protect both the college and our students from costly litigation.
We try to allow access to legal online music distributors, such as iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio and Last.fm, though you may be unable to connect during peak traffic times.
The Recording Industry Association of America(RIAA) maintains a list of legal online music sources.
Gaming Bethany s network gives priority to traffic that is more likely to be academic in nature.
As such, only a limited amount of bandwidth is available for gaming, so you may be unable to connect during peak traffic times.
The status of on-line gaming servers, of course, is beyond our control.)
You may want to contact the IT Helpdesk to have the Ethernet ports in your dorm room activated, since wired connections are much more stable, and frequently faster.
If our web filter has blocked some of the connection traffic from your game, please contact the IT Helpdesk for assistance.
Bethany does not block specific ports.
Please note that we give lower priority to gaming-related support requests.
New Connections To maintain order and security, data network connections are made only by specialized personnel under the direction of the Information Technology Services department.
You are encouraged to attach appropriate equipment only at existing user-connection points.
All requests for additional campus-wide data network connections or for the relocation of a connection should be directed to the Information Technology Services department.
Bethany Lutheran College provides Christian higher education in a challenging academic environment where personal mentoring guides students to pursue knowledge, truth, and discernment for productive and fulfilling lives.

Getting Started First, read through the SSID(service set identifier) section in order to identify which of the available wireless networks you should connect
Then proceed to the step-by-step instructions for connecting your device to the appropriate Methodist University wireless network.
4
Available SSID s SSID means Service Set Identifier, which is a 32-character sequence that uniquely identifies a wireless LAN(WLAN).
In other words, the SSID is the name of the wireless network that is advertised from the wireless access point, which is, in turn, available to be connected to from a wireless device.
Read the following SSID options carefully in order to understand which one is applicable to your needs as either a faculty, staff, or student MU network user along with the requirements of the device that you are wanting to connect to the MU network.
Please note that this SSID option will no longer be available after the middle of December 2018.
Therefore, faculty, staff, and students should begin using one of the other connectivity options listed below in order to prevent a disruption in wireless connectivity.

Network connectivity has many advantages which you will discover as you explore MITnet, and the Internet beyond.
But connectivity also requires that users of the network understand their responsibilities in order to protect the integrity of the system and the privacy of other users.
This section summarizes the rules that apply to all users of MITnet.
We expect you to follow all these rules, and we hope you will encourage others to follow them as well.
To report someone willfully violating the rules, send email to stopit@mit.edu.
If you believe you are in danger, call the Campus Police immediately at x3-1212.
Summary The listing below provides only summaries of the rules.
For the full text of each rule, please see the following pages.
Don't violate the intended use of MITnet.
Don't let anyone know your password(s).

Don't violate the privacy of other users.

Don't misuse the intellectual property of others.

Don't use MITnet to harass anyone in any way.
Don't misuse electronic communications and collaboration services.

No hubs/switches/routers allowed on MITnet.
MITnet Rules of Use MITnet and other computing resources at MIT are shared among community members.
The MITnet Rules of Use are intended to help members of the MIT community use MIT's computing and network facilities responsibly, safely, and efficiently, thereby maximizing the availability of these facilities to community members.
Complying with them will help maximize access to these facilities, and assure that all use of them is responsible, legal, and respectful of privacy.
If you have questions or wish further information about any of the MITnet policies outlined below, send email to security@mit.edu.
All network users are expected to follow these rules.
Violations of the rules can subject the offender to Institute disciplinary proceedings, loss of network privileges, and, in some cases, civil or criminal prosecution.
Note: Laws that apply in "the real world" also apply in the "virtual" networked computer world(including MITnet).
Laws about libel, harassment, privacy, copyright, stealing, threats, etc.
are not suspended for computer users, but apply to all members of society whatever medium they happen to be using: face-to-face, phone, or computer.
Furthermore, law-enforcement officials are more computer-savvy than ever, and violations of the law in "Cyberspace" are vigorously prosecuted.
Similarly, Institute policies(as described in MIT's Policies and Procedures, for example) also apply to MITnet users.
Complying With the Intended Use of the System It is important that you understand the purpose of MITnet so that your use of the system is in compliance with that purpose.

Don't violate the intended use of MITnet.
The purpose of MITnet is to support research, education, and MIT administrative activities, by providing access to computing resources and the opportunity for collaborative work.
All use of the MIT network must be consistent with this purpose.
For example: Don't try to interfere with or alter the integrity of the system at large, by doing any of the following: permitting another individual to use your account impersonating other individuals in communication(particularly via forged email, texts, instant messages and social media postings) attempting to capture or crack passwords or encryption destroying or altering data or programs belonging to other users Don't try to restrict or deny access to the system by legitimate users.
Don't use MITnet for private financial gain.
For example, users are not permitted to run a private business on MITnet.
Commercial activity is permitted, but only for business done on behalf of MIT or its organizations.

Section 13.2.3 of MIT's Policies and Procedures: "MIT's computing and telecommunications facilities and services are to be used for Institute purposes only and not for the benefit of private individuals or other organizations without authorization.")
Don't transmit threatening or harassing materials.
Cf.
Rule 5.)
Assuring Ethical Use of the System Along with the many opportunities that MITnet provides for members of the MIT community to share information comes the responsibility to use the system in accordance with MIT standards of honesty and personal conduct.
Those standards, outlined in Section 13.2 of MIT's Policies and Procedures, call for all members of the community to act in a responsible, professional way.
Appropriate use of MITnet resources includes maintaining the security of the system, protecting privacy, and conforming to applicable laws, particularly copyright and harassment laws.

Don't let anyone know your password(s).
While you should feel free to let others know your username(this is the name by which you are known to the whole Internet user community), you should never let anyone know your account passwords.
This includes even trusted friends, and computer system administrators(e.g., IS&T staff).
Giving someone else your password is like giving them a signed blank check, or your charge card.
You should never do this, even to "lend" your account to them temporarily.
Anyone who has your password can use your account, and whatever they do that affects the system will be traced back to your username -- if your username or account is used in an abusive or otherwise inappropriate manner, you can be held responsible.
In fact, there is never any reason to tell anyone your password: every MIT student, faculty member, or on-campus staff person who wants an account of his or her own can have one.
And if your goal is permitting other users to read or write some of your files, there are always ways of doing this without giving away your password.
For information about how to manage the security of your account, including advice on how to choose a good password, see Strong Passwords.

Don't violate the privacy of other users.
as amended) and other federal laws protect the privacy of users of wire and electronic communications.
The facilities of MITnet encourage sharing of information.
Security mechanisms for protecting information from unintended access, from within the system or from the outside, are minimal.
These mechanisms, by themselves, are not sufficient for a large community in which protection of individual privacy is as important as sharing(see, for example, sections 11.2, 11.3, and 13.2 of MIT's Policies and Procedures).
Users must therefore supplement the system's security mechanisms by using the system in a manner that preserves the privacy of themselves and others.
As Section 11.1 of MIT's Policies and Procedures notes, "Invasions of privacy can take many forms, often inadvertent or well-intended."
All users of MITnet should make sure that their actions don't violate the privacy of other users, if even unintentionally.
Some specific areas to watch for include the following: Don't try to access the files or directories of another user without clear authorization from that user.
Typically, this authorization is signaled by the other user's setting file-access permissions to allow public or group reading of the files.
If you are in doubt, ask the user.
Don't try to intercept or otherwise monitor any network communications not explicitly intended for you.
These include logins, e-mail, user-to-user dialog, and any other network traffic not explicitly intended for you.
Unless you understand how to protect private information on a computer system, don't use the system to store personal information about individuals which they would not normally disseminate freely about themselves(e.g., grades, address information, etc.)
Don't make any personal information about individuals publicly available without their permission.
This includes both text and number data about the person(biographical information, phone numbers, etc.
as well as representations of the person(graphical images, video segments, sound bites, etc.)
For instance, it is not appropriate to include a picture of someone on a World Wide Web page without that person's permission.
Depending on the source of the information or image, there may also be copyright issues involved;
Don't create any shared programs that secretly collect information about their users.
Software on MITnet is subject to the same guidelines for protecting privacy as any other information-gathering project at the Institute.
This means, for example, that you may not collect information about individual users without their consent.)
Don't remotely log into(or otherwise use) any workstation or computer not designated explicitly for public logins over the network -- even if the configuration of the computer permits remote access -- unless you have explicit permission from the owner and the current user of that computer to log into that machine.

Don't misuse the intellectual property of others.
MIT faculty, students, and staff produce and consume a vast amount of intellectual property, much of it in digital form, as part of our education and research missions.
This includes materials covered by the patent, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as license or other contractual terms.
Members of the MIT community also avail themselves of a wide variety of entertainment content that is available on the Internet, most of which is protected by copyright or subject to other legal restrictions on use.
All users need to insure that their use of all these protected digital materials respects the rights of the owners.
Digital materials that may be covered by this rule, without limitation, are: Data E-books Games Journals and periodicals Logos Movies Music Photographs and other graphics Software Textbooks Television programs Other forms of video content You should assume that all materials are subject to these legal protections, and may have some restrictions on use.
Ease of access, downloading, sharing, etc., should not be interpreted as a license for use and re-distribution.
Of particular concern is the prevalence of peer-to-peer file sharing as a medium for the unauthorized exchange of copyrighted materials, including movies, music, games, and other software programs.
As required by the Higher Education Opportunity Act, MIT has developed and implemented a written plan to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials by users of MIT s network.
For more information, see Copyright at MIT.

Don't use MITnet to harass anyone in any way.
Harassment," according to MIT's Policies and Procedures(Section 9.5), is defined as: ".any conduct, verbal or physical, on or off campus, which has the intent or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual or group's educational or work performance at MIT or that creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive educational, work or living environment.
Harassment on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or age includes harassment of an individual in terms of a stereotyped group characteristic, or because of that person's identification with a particular group."
The Institute's harassment policy extends to the networked world.
For example, sending email or other electronic messages which unreasonably interfere with anyone's education or work at MIT may constitute harassment and is in violation of the intended use of the system.
Any member of the MIT community who feels harassed is encouraged to seek assistance and resolution of the complaint.
To report incidents of on-line harassment, send email to abuse@mit.edu.
If you believe you are in danger, call the Campus Police immediately at x3-1212.
Assuring Proper Use of the System MITnet's resources, as well as the resources MITnet gives you access to(e.g., computing facilities, email and calendaring services, instant messaging, wikis, the web), are powerful tools that provide maximum benefit to the entire MIT community when used reasonably and in manners consistent with the intended uses of those resources.

Don't misuse electronic communications and collaboration services.
MIT provides electronic communications and collaboration services to members of the MIT community.
These services include, but are not limited to, electronic mail, mailing lists, instant messaging, message boards, websites, wikis, blogs, social networking sites, forums, collaborative spaces, Voice over IP(VoIP) and video services.
Some members of the MIT community access similar, or additional, 3rd party services on the Internet.
Users of all such services have a responsibility to use these services properly and to respect the rights of others in their use of these services, and in accordance with published terms of service.
Users may not use these services in violation of any applicable law.
All relevant MIT policies apply to the use of these services, but in particular: Any use that might contribute to the creation of a hostile academic or work environment is prohibited, Any commercial use not required for coursework, research or the conduct of MIT business is prohibited, Any non-incidental personal use such as advertisements, solicitations or promotions is prohibited [Note: some services exist on campus that have been designed for buying, selling and exchanging items within the MIT community, and those are allowed].
MIT Senior Leadership has authorized certain individuals to send electronic mail to large groups, e.g., all faculty, all employees, all undergraduates, Class of 2022, or to the entire MIT community.

Purpose The purpose of this procedure is to establish rules for governing wireless networking at TAMUK.
This procedure limits interference with the University's network infrastructure, promotes greater security in campus networking, and supports the academic mission of the University in order to provide reliable and secure wireless network access.
Audience This procedure applies to wireless network users at TAMUK.
Management of Radio Frequencies a. TAMUK reserves the right to govern unlicensed radio frequencies within its boundaries.
iTech is responsible for managing these radio frequencies and may restrict the use of any devices that can cause interference in the unlicensed radio frequency ranges.
These include cordless phones, microwave ovens, and high voltage audio speakers.
iTech is solely responsible for providing wireless networking services on campus.
No other department may deploy wireless network access points or other wireless service on campus.
Personal or departmental wireless access points are strictly prohibited.
Page of 29.01.99.K1.290 Wireless Access Standard Administrative Procedure 1) iTech may provide temporary wireless access points to support campus events when possible.
The University will deploy a campus wireless network, based on the 802.11 standards.
iTech will work with departments to accommodate specific educational or research applications where technically feasible.

Wireless Service Considerations Wireless services may not be available in all areas of the campus.
The wireless network should be viewed as augmenting the wired network, to provide more flexible network use and not as a primary means of network access.
Applications that require large amounts of bandwidth, or are sensitive to changes in signal quality and strength may not be appropriate for wireless access.

Security Standards a. IEEE 802.1X is the authentication standard.
Additional security procedures may be applied as needed.
Wireless users will be required to authenticate with their university provided credentials.

Guest wireless access is offered in most locations on campus and provides internet service only.
Guest users can self-register their portable devices for a specific period of time set by iTech.

Guests must adhere to all university policies governing the use of information resources.
Sponsors provide guest network access on good faith that they will not engage in any illegal or abusive activities while using the TAMUK network, and are ultimately responsible for the actions of their guests.

Eduroam Wireless Access a. Eduroam wireless access is also available in most locations on campus and provides internet service only.
Contact your home campus for assistance in authentication.
Disciplinary Actions Violation of this procedure may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination for employees and temporaries;
a termination of contract relations in the case of contractors or consultants; dismissal for interns and volunteers; or suspension or expulsion in the case of students.
Additionally, individuals are subject to loss of TAMUK Information Resources access privileges, civil, and criminal prosecution.

Once your system shows that you are connected, open your favorite browser and go to a site off-campus such as http://google.com or http://yahoo.com.
The system should then redirect you to a page that says "Please click here to connect to the network" and has 10.0.8.61 in the address bar.
Step2 Click the link that says "Please click here to connect to the network."
You will be given the choice of registering your wireless device with the MSU network as either an authenticated user or a guest.
If you are a registered student or are a current MSU employee(staff or faculty), you should use the "Network Login" section of the page shown below to authenticate using your MSU credentials.
For students, this is the MSU Portal username and password but the username must be entered in the form of STUDENT\portalusername.
For staff and faculty, this will be your network credentials with which you normally log into campus systems, with ADMIN\ inserted in front of the username.
If you are visiting the campus, then you can use the "Register as a Guest" section to register your device and gain temporary access to the Internet only.
Step 2a If you selected the "Network Login" option and your credentials are correct, you will see a screen similar to the one below.
You will need to check the box for "I agree to the Acceptable Use Policy" before clicking "Complete Registration."
Step 2b If you selected "Register as Guest," you will see a screen similar to the one below.

Section 3: Definition of Hybrid and Online Course Virginia Wesleyan College offers a very small number of courses that utilize distance learning.
The College is committed to only offering those courses that conform as well as traditional classroom courses to established core principles of small classes that engage students in an active learning environment.
Such courses are categorized as either "hybrid" or "online" courses.
Hybrid courses are 30% or more instructional seat time online.
Online courses are 7S% or more instructional seat time online.
All must be approved as such by the Educational Programs Commission.
In registration materials, such courses will be identified with the following designations: OL = online, and HY = hybrid.
Section 4: The Blackboard Platform and Web-based Instruction Blackboard is a Learning Management System that is web-based to allow 24/7 access to course related materials provided by the Instructor.
An Internet connection is needed to access Blackboard but there is nothing to install or download to operate this software.
Blackboard works with both Windows and Macintosh computers.
Students can access Blackboard using most Web browsers, but it performs best with an up-to-date version of Mozilla Firefo
Every VWC student is initially enrolled in Blackboard.
For initial access to Blackboard, students use initial network username and password.
Thereafter, students are advised to change their Blackboard password to ensure security of access.
Within the framework of regular face-to-face instruction, instructors at VWC utilize Blackboard for many aspects of course delivery: course materials are posted in Bb, tests can be taken through Bb, papers can be submitted and reviewed, discussion boards tracked, etc.
Some faculty may choose to supplement their courses outside of Blackboard with third-party software, such as textbook-provided supplemental software.
This software is accessed through the Internet using a username and password provided by the third party.
Under this arrangement, the course instructor is responsible for consulting with the Director of Instructional Technology to ensure secure and private access to individual student records and grading information.
Note: the arrangement with each third-party provider is so unique that if issues arise with accessing websites, students should contact the course instructor directly to resolve any access or password issues.)
When VWC courses are offered as hybrid or online courses(defined above), instructors are likely to utilize Blackboard for course delivery.
IfVWC instructors utilize a third-party software for hybrid or online courses, they are responsible for consulting with the Director of Instructional Technology to ensure acceptable privacy and security protections.
Policy on Acceptable Use of Computer Resources | The City College of New York Skip to main content About About INTRODUCTION CUNY's computer resources are dedicated to the support of the University s mission of education, research and public service.
In furtherance of this mission, CUNY respects, upholds and endeavors to safeguard the principles of academic freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of inquiry.
CUNY recognizes that there is a concern among the University community that because information created, used, transmitted or stored in electronic form is by its nature susceptible to disclosure, invasion, loss, and similar risks, electronic communications and transactions will be particularly vulnerable to infringements of academic freedom.
CUNY s commitment to the principles of academic freedom and freedom of expression includes electronic information.
Therefore, whenever possible, CUNY will resolve doubts about the need to access CUNY Computer Resources in favor of a User s privacy interest.
However, the use of CUNY Computer Resources, including for electronic transactions and communications, like the use of other University-provided resources and activities, is subject to the requirements of legal and ethical behavior.
This policy is intended to support the free exchange of ideas among members of the CUNY community and between the CUNY community and other communities, while recognizing the responsibilities and limitations associated with such exchange.

Users should consult with the IT director at their college before installing any programs on CUNY Computer Resources that they are not sure are safe or may cause excess strain.
CUNY Computer Resources must not be used in a manner that could reasonably be expected to cause or does cause, directly or indirectly, unwarranted or unsolicited interference with the activity of other users, including: chain letters, virus hoaxes or other e-mail transmissions that potentially disrupt normal e-mail service; spamming, junk mail or other unsolicited mail that is not related to CUNY business and is sent without a reasonable expectation that the recipient would welcome receiving it; the inclusion on e-mail lists of individuals who have not requested membership on the lists, other than the inclusion of members of the CUNY community on lists related to CUNY business; and downloading of large videos, films or similar media files for personal use.
CUNY has the right to require Users to limit or refrain from other specific uses if, in the opinion of the IT director at the User s college, such use interferes with efficient operations of the system, subject to appeal to the President or, in the case of central office staff, to the Chancellor.
CUNY names, trademarks and logos belong to the University and are protected by law.
Users of CUNY Computer Resources may not state or imply that they speak on behalf of CUNY or use a CUNY name, trademark or logo without authorization to do
Affiliation with CUNY does not, by itself, imply authorization to speak on behalf of CUNY.
Notwithstanding subsection 9.a.
above, CUNY employees and students may indicate their CUNY affiliation on e-mail, other correspondence, and in academic or professionally-related research, publications or professional appearances, so long as they do not state or imply that they are speaking on behalf of the University.
CUNY employs various measures to protect the security of its computer resources and of Users accounts.
However, CUNY cannot guarantee such security.
Users are responsible for engaging in safe computing practices such as guarding and not sharing their passwords, changing passwords regularly, logging out of systems at the end of use, and protecting Non-Public University Information, as well as for following CUNY s IT Security Policies and Procedures.
Users must report incidents of non-compliance with IT Security Policies and Procedures or other security incidents to the University Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, and the Chief Information Officer at the affected User s college.
CUNY reserves the right to install spam, anti-malware, and spyware filters and similar devices if necessary in the judgment of CUNY s Office of Information Technology or a college IT director to protect the security and integrity of CUNY Computer Resources.
CUNY will not install filters that restrict access to e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms or websites based solely on content, unless such content is illegal, such as child pornography sites.
Principal investigators and others who use CUNY Computer Resources to collect, examine, analyze, transmit or store research information that is required by law or regulation to be held confidential or for which a promise of confidentiality has been given are responsible for taking steps to protect such confidential research information from unauthorized access or modification.
In general, this means storing the information on a computer or auxiliary hard drive that provides strong access controls(passwords) and encrypting files, documents, and messages for protection against inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure while in storage or in transit over data networks.
Robust encryption and passwords must be used to protect Non-Public University Information, and is strongly recommended for information stored electronically on all computers, especially portable devices such as notebook computers, Personal Digital Assistants(PDAs), and portable data storage(e.g., auxiliary hard drives, memory sticks) that are vulnerable to theft or loss, as well as for information transmitted over public networks.
Software and protocols used should be reviewed and approved by CUNY s Office of Information Technology.
In addition, the steps taken to protect such confidential research information should be included in submissions to the CUNY Institutional Review Board reviewing the research protocol.
CUNY may copy a User s account and/or hard drive on a CUNY Computer Resource, without monitoring or inspecting the contents of such account and/or hard drive, at any time for preservation of data or evidence, without notice to the User.
CUNY does not routinely monitor, inspect, or disclose individual usage of CUNY Computer Resources without the User s consent.
In most instances, if the University needs information located in a CUNY Computer Resource, it will simply request it from the author or custodian.
However, CUNY IT professionals and staff do regularly monitor general usage patterns as part of normal system operations and maintenance and might, in connection with these duties, observe the contents of web sites, e-mail or other electronic communications.
Except as provided in this policy or by law, these individuals are not permitted to seek out contents or transactional information, or disclose or otherwise use what they have observed.
Nevertheless, because of the inherent vulnerability of computer technology to unauthorized intrusions, Users have no guarantee of privacy during any use of CUNY computer resources or in any data in them, whether or not a password or other entry identification or encryption is used.
Users may expect that the privacy of their electronic communications and of any materials stored in any CUNY Computer Resource dedicated to their use will not be intruded upon by CUNY except as outlined in this policy.
CUNY may specifically monitor or inspect the activity and accounts of individual users of CUNY computer resources, including individual login sessions, e-mail and other communications, without notice, in the following circumstances: when the User has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, as by posting to Usenet or a web page; when it is reasonably necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of CUNY or other computer resources, as determined by the college chief information officer or his or her designee, after consultation with CUNY s chief information officer or his or her designee; when it is reasonably necessary to diagnose and resolve technical problems involving system hardware, software, or communications, as determined by the college chief information officer or his or her designee, after consultation with CUNY s chief information officer or his or her designee; when it is reasonably necessary to determine whether CUNY may be vulnerable to liability, or when failure to act might result in significant bodily harm, significant property loss or damage, or loss of evidence, as determined by the college president or a vice president designated by the president or, in the case of the Central Office by the Chancellor or his or her designee, after consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the Chair of the University Faculty Senate(if a current CUNY faculty member s account or activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable; when there is a reasonable basis to believe that CUNY policy or federal, state or local law has been or is being violated, as determined by the college president or a vice president designated by the president or, in the case of the Central Office by the Chancellor or his or her designee, after consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the Chair of the University Faculty Senate(if a current CUNY faculty member s account or activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable; when an account appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the monitoring of general activity and usage patterns, as determined by the college president or a vice president designated by the president and the college chief information officer or his or her designee or, in the case of the Central Office by the Chancellor or his or her designee, after consultation with CUNY s chief information officer or his or her designee, the Office of General Counsel, and the Chair of the University Faculty Senate(if a current CUNY faculty member s account or activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable; or as otherwise required by law.
In those situations in which the Chair of the University Faculty Senate is to be consulted prior to monitoring or inspecting an account or activity, the following procedures shall apply: if the monitoring or inspection of an account or activity requires physical entry into a faculty member s office, the faculty member shall be advised prior thereto and shall be permitted to be present to observe, except where specifically forbidden by law; and the college president or the Chancellor, as the case may be, shall report the completion of the monitoring or inspection to the Chair and the CUNY employee affected, who shall also be told the reason for the monitoring or inspection, except where specifically forbidden by law.
CUNY, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any general or individual monitoring or inspection to appropriate CUNY personnel or agents, or law enforcement or other agencies.
The results may be used in college disciplinary proceedings, discovery proceedings in legal actions, or otherwise as is necessary to protect the interests of the University.
In addition, users should be aware that CUNY may be required to disclose to the public under FOIL communications made by means of CUNY Computer Resources whether in conjunction with University business or as incidental personal use.
Any disclosures of activity of accounts of individual Users to persons or entities outside of CUNY, whether discretionary or required by law, shall be approved by the General Counsel and shall be conducted in accordance with any applicable law.
Except where specifically forbidden by law, CUNY employees subject to such disclosures shall be informed promptly after the disclosure of the actions taken and the reasons for them.
The Office of General Counsel shall issue an annual statement of the instances of account monitoring or inspection that fall within categories D through G above.
The statement shall indicate the number of such instances and the cause and result of each.
No personally identifiable data shall be included in this statement.
See CUNY s Web Site Privacy Policy for additional information regarding data collected by CUNY from visitors to the CUNY website at www.cuny.edu.
Waiver of Policy A CUNY employee or student may apply to the General Counsel for an exception or waiver from one or more of the provisions of this policy.
Such application may be for a single use or for periodic or continuous uses, such as in connection with a course or program.
Any application for a waiver should be made prior to using the CUNY Computer Resource for the purposes described in the application.
The written waiver application must state: the policy provision or provisions for which the User is seeking a waiver; how the User plans to use CUNY Computer Resource to be covered by the waiver and the reasons why the User believes a waiver should be approved; if the waiver involves confidential research information, what steps will be taken to protect such information; the length of time for which the waiver is being requested; and if a student, how and by whom the student will be supervised.
The General Counsel shall consult with the CUNY s chief information officer and the president of the applicant s college(or, if the applicant is a Central Office employee, the Chancellor) or their designees, prior to making a determination regarding the application.
Users should be aware that CUNY cannot waive federal, state or local law; for example, the contents of CUNY Computer Resources(including confidential research information) may be subject to a valid subpoena regardless of the terms of any waiver.
Violation of this policy may result in suspension or termination of an individual s right of access to CUNY Computer Resources, disciplinary action by appropriate CUNY authorities, referral to law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution, or other legal action, including action to recover civil damages and penalties.
Violations will normally be handled through the University disciplinary procedures applicable to the relevant User.
For example, alleged violations by students will normally be investigated, and any penalties or other discipline will normally be imposed, by the Office of Student Affairs.
CUNY has the right to temporarily suspend computer use privileges and to remove from CUNY computer resources material it believes violates this policy, pending the outcome of an investigation of misuse or finding of violation.
This power may be exercised only by the president of each college or the Chancellor.
Additional rules, policies, guidelines and/or restrictions may be in effect for specific computers, systems, or networks, or at specific computer facilities at the discretion of the directors of those facilities.
Any such rules which potentially limit the privacy or confidentiality of electronic communications or information contained in or delivered by or over CUNY Computer Resources will be subject to the substantive and procedural safeguards provided by this policy.
CUNY shall not be responsible for any damages, costs or other liabilities of any nature whatsoever with regard to the use of CUNY Computer Resources.
Thisincludes, but is not limited to, damages caused by unauthorized access to CUNY Computer Resources, data loss, or other damages resulting from delays, non- deliveries, or service interruptions, whether or not resulting from circumstances under the CUNY s control.
Users receive and use information obtained through CUNY Computer Resources at their own risk.
CUNY makes no warranties(expressed or implied) with respect to the use of CUNY Computer Resources.
CUNY accepts no responsibility for the content of web pages or graphics that are linked from CUNY web pages, for any advice or information received by a user through use of CUNY Computer Resources, or for any costs or charges incurred by a user as a result of seeking or accepting such advice or information.
CUNY reserves the right to change this policy and other related policies at any time.
CUNY reserves any rights and remedies that it may have under any applicable law, rule or regulation.
Nothing contained in this policy will in any way act as a waiver of such rights and remedies.

This policy outlines the standards for acceptable use of college computing and information technology resources that include, but are not limited to, equipment, software, networks, data, and telecommunications services, whether owned, leased, or otherwise provided by Nichols.
This policy is intended to reflect the College's commitment to the principles, goals, and ideals described in the Nichols College Mission Statement.
Coordination with Other Policies Users of information technology resources at Nichols College are advised that other college policies, including those for Human Resources, the faculty and student handbooks, and notably those policies governing copyright and intellectual property compliance, may be related to the use of information technology resources, and that those policies must be observed in conjunction with this policy.
Additionally, laws(including, but not limited to FERPA, HIPAA, etc.)
and college policies relating to disclosure of confidential information must be observed.
Access to and Expectations of Persons Using Information Technology Resources It is the policy of Nichols College to maintain access for its community to local, national and international sources of electronic information in order to provide an atmosphere that encourages the free exchange of ideas and sharing of information.
Nichols maintains a variety of information technologies for use as resources for people, catalysts for learning, increased access to technology, and an enriched quality of learning.
Access to this environment and the college's information technology resources is a privilege and must be treated with high ethical and legal standards.
Both the Nichols community as a whole and each individual user have an obligation to abide by the following standards of acceptable and ethical use: Use only those computing and information technology resources and data for which you have authorization and only in the manner and to the extent authorized.
Use computing and information technology resources only for their intended purpose.
Page of Revised: 11/20/17 Protect the access and integrity of computing and information technology resources.
Abide by applicable laws and college policies and all applicable contracts and licenses; and respect the copyright and intellectual property rights of others, including the legal use of copyrighted material.
Respect the privacy and personal rights of others.
Connecting end-user equipment to the network that has appropriately maintained software; including(but not limited to) operating systems, browsers, plug-ins, anti-virus, and other software as appropriate.
Access to Nichols information technology and computing resources is a privilege granted to students, staff, and faculty at Nichols.
The college extends access privileges to individual users of the collegelogy and computing resources.
The extension of these of and adherence to the corresponding user responsibilities detailed in this policy.
The college reserves the rights to limit, restrict, or extend access to information technology resources as it deems appropriate.
Residence Hall Network Access Restrictions No student shall turn on or connect student owned wireless access points, gateways, or routers in the residence halls or elsewhere on campus.
These wireless routers are commonly sold in retail stores and provide home private use; however when brought on campus they cause Nichols College wireless interference, network congestion, and loss of network access to other students.
Application This policy applies to all users of Nichols computing and information technology resources, including faculty, staff, students, alumni, guests, external individuals or organizations and individuals accessing external network services, such as the Internet via college facilities.
The Chief Information Officer will determine operational policies, networking standards and procedures to implement the principles outlined in this policy.
The Information Technology department(IT) has the right to protect shared information technology resources.
Ownership Nichols College assumes and reserves ownership of all data, files, messages, and programs stored in its computer systems and cloud-based services.
Users cannot claim ownership of any data stored in Nichols College computer systems.
Users can, however, expect exclusive use of all e-mail messages stored in their user accounts.
Cooperation with any system administrator requests regarding user computing activities is expected.
Only under certain unusual circumstances involving issues of system integrity, sexual harassment, or suspicion of illegal use of computer resources, and at the direction of the president of the college, Chief Information Officer, Vice President for Administration, Director of Human Resources, or Dean of Student Services, will the system administrator access email stored in user accounts.
Page of Revised: 11/20/17 In the event that any user is separated from the college, for any reason, and their access to technology resources is terminated, the college bears no responsibility to provide the user with copies of any personal data, files, messages, or programs from college resources.
The only exception to this policy is for those employees that would like to retrieve academic materials developed and used in support of their teaching and academic leadership responsibilities.
manager, or their designee, would be responsible for reviewing all files/messages in the applicable folder(s) to ensure that there is no confidential information in the files/messages being copied for the employee.
Copying Copyrighted Materials(software, music, videos) Respect for the intellectual work and property of others has traditionally been essential to the mission of academic institutions.
As members of the academic community, Nichols College values the free exchange of ideas.
Just as Nichols College does not tolerate plagiarism, it does not condone the unauthorized copying of any copyrighted materials.
The copying of these types of materials without the permission of its owner is illegal and a criminal offense.
Storage/Copying of Confidential and Proprietary Information Nichols maintains systems that store a significant amount of confidential information on faculty, staff, students, donors, prospects, vendors, etc.
Access to this information is restricted based on a need to know.
Under no circumstances is confidential information to be copied or exported off the server and stored on a laptop/portable computer, tablet, desktop computer, home computer, cloud-based storage(except for T.
provisioned storage such as the Office365 suite of storage services), smart phone, or removable storage media, including, but not limited to, CD/DVD, USB key/thumb drive, or IPOD/MP3 players.
With regard to cloud-based storage of files, the College must insure continued access to confidential information in the event that an individual severs ties to the College, whether the separation is amicable or otherwise.
Therefore, the only cloud-based storage allowed is that which is provisioned by T.
It should also be understood that e-mail messages, which have file attachments containing confidential information, run the same risk of exposure as files on removable storage media, laptops, tablets, or smart phones.
Therefore, files containing confidential information must not be attached to any e-mail messages.
The restrictions listed above for confidential information also apply to the storage of College-proprietary information.
Use of College-Assigned Usernames and Passwords Nichols College assigns usernames and passwords to individuals to provide users with access to specific information and system resources, based on the needs of their job function.
Under no circumstances are users to share usernames and passwords with anyone else, unless requested to do so by a system administrator
Page of Revised: 11/20/17 for the purpose of troubleshooting a system issue.
Sharing of this information will be expose that user to risk of disciplinary action.
Any need for system access to data or resources must be processed as a request through the appropriate channels, so that appropriate authorizations can be obtained and documented.
Right to Monitor and Access The campus computer systems linked together on a common fiber-optic network are owned by Nichols College, or, in some cases, are privately owned as personal computers brought to campus by faculty, staff, or students.
Regardless of ownership, every computer attached to the campus network for any reason(e.g., Internet connectivity, e-mail accessibility, etc.)

Definitions Definitions of capitalized terms are set forth in Appendix

Policy Statement The University s information technology Resources are a critical part of the University s teaching and research missions supporting both academic and administrative units.
In order to effectively deliver these services the University maintains this Acceptable Use policy to guide its use of Resources.
Resources are the property of the University and are to be used for only University purposes.
This policy governs the appropriate use of Resources.
These rules are intended to provide access in an open manner, and not impede the greatest use of SMU Resources, consistent with the federal, state, and local law and with the general principles that govern an academic community.

Purpose The purpose of this policy is to assure an information infrastructure that supports the University s teaching, research and service mission.
Along with the privilege of using the Resources of the University come specific responsibilities as outlined in this policy.

Applicability This policy applies to all Users and to all Resources, whether managed by the Office of Information Technology("OIT") or by another person or entity.
This policy provides a minimum standard for Resource usage at the University and does not restrict creation and enforcement of policies for individual campus administrative or academic units.
Policies existing elsewhere on campus must comply with this policy.

Questions The Chief Information Officer( CIO) or designee shall be responsible for interpretation of this policy, resolution of problems and conflicts with departmental policies, and special situations.
The CIO may grant exceptions to this policy and/or standards after a formal review as provided below.

Acceptable Use Each User may only use the computers, computer accounts, and computer files for which that User has been given specific authorization.
Users may not communicate any information concerning any personal identification number, account credentials, social security number, credit card number, financial account number, or other confidential information without the permission of its owner or the controlling authority of the Resource.
The University is bound by its contractual and license agreements respecting certain third party resources; Users must comply with all such agreements when using such resources.
Transmission of broadcast email is governed by this policy.
Users may not transmit unsolicited content, including advertising third party materials or services.
Users must not transmit content that is intimidating in nature or that is intended to harass recipients, including content that contains obscene, indecent, lewd or lascivious materials.
Users must abide by OIT policies and procedures and by all federal, state, and local laws, including copyright and other intellectual property laws, and must not conduct any activity that would jeopardize the University s tax exempt status, or that would constitute use for political purposes, for commercial purposes(unless otherwise authorized in writing by the President or a Vice President, after consultation with the Controller), for criminal purposes or for personal economic gain.
Users must protect passwords and secure Resources against unauthorized use or access.
Users must work with OIT to configure hardware and software in a way that reasonably prevents unauthorized users from accessing the University s Resources.
Users may not use another individual's account, attempt to capture or guess other Users' passwords, reverse engineer software or destroy data without authorization from the owner of the data or other appropriate University employee.
Users must not use tools that are normally used to assess security or to attack computer systems or networks(e.g., password 'crackers,' vulnerability scanners, network sniffers, etc.)
unless specifically authorized to do so by the Chief Security Officer( CSO).
The University does not assess additional charges for identity verification.
The identity credential used by the University includes an assigned eight-digit identification number(SMUID) combined with each student s unique password.
The cost of setting up and administering the SMUID/Password system is recovered through general tuition and fees.
The University does not assess additional charges for students enrolled in distance education courses to use the SMUID/Password system.

Acquisition and Deployment of Equipment and Software Any purchase of a Resource, whether stand-alone or interconnected with other Resources on campus, must take into account standards developed by OIT.
OIT will make the standards available to the SMU community.
OIT implements and maintains University site licenses for software to ensure that University users receive favorable pricing and support terms.
Business Continuity Departments responsible for critical information technology services must maintain a business continuity plan which accounts for computer facilities, equipment, staffing, and Resource needs.
Resources are subject to backup procedures and methods to ensure continuity of operations.
All backup media(e.g.
removable backup tapes) stored outside University data centers must be encrypted, both at rest and in motion, to reduce risk of interception by unauthorized parties and must be stored at a distance sufficiently far from the primary data location to ensure that a regional disaster will not disrupt access to both the primary and backup data simultaneously.
When backup media is retired, it must be destroyed according to OIT s security standards.

Email Emails sent or received by Users in the course of conducting University business are University Data.
Users must use University-provided email accounts for conducting University business, rather than personal email accounts.
Emails containing confidential information must be encrypted with tools and processes approved by the CSO.

Guest Access Access to the campus network by a guest shall be coordinated through a University sponsor.
The sponsor will take responsibility for the actions of the guest while they are using Resources.
Staff or faculty at service desks(library reference desk, computer help desk, or event support staff) shall not generally sponsor guests unless they have invited the guest to campus or are asked to sponsor the guest by an eligible sponsor.

Mobile Equipment It is the responsibility of anyone who utilizes the SMU network for the purpose of accessing or processing University Data using Mobile Equipment to take appropriate measures at all times to safeguard that information.
All University employees will ensure they are taking every reasonable precaution against accidental or intentional data compromise by implementing a pin to access the Mobile Equipment.

Remote Access and Virtual Private Network(VPN) University employees who work remotely must ensure that the computer used to access Resources meets all OIT security standards.
Users must use a VPN when accessing Resources from an insecure network or when accessing a Resource containing confidential information.

Cloud or Hosted Computing University departments and schools may only use OIT-approved cloud services for storage and/or processing of University Data.

Third Party Access The CSO must assess and approve all third-party vendors that host or access University Data.
Contracts with third parties will include provisions relating to information security as required by the CSO.
Third parties will be expected to protect Resources and University Data with security at least equal to the security described in this policy, in University Policy 8.2, Information Security, or otherwise required by the CSO.

Wireless Access All wireless access points within the University must be approved and centrally managed by OIT.
Non-sanctioned installations of wireless equipment or use of unauthorized equipment on campus premises is prohibited.
All wireless networks managed by the University will require authentication via a University ID or will provide a means for guests to register.

Broadcast Email Messages on Campus It is University policy to regulate messages broadcast to the campus via email to assure that such messages are of overall importance to the entire community.
Any community member or campus group wishing to send broadcast mail messages should review the requirements listed below.
There are two options for delivering broadcast messages: One is through the four main bulk distribution lists which include all undergraduate students, all graduate students, all faculty and all staff.
Messages distributed through these main bulk lists will be reviewed by the Vice President for Development and External Affairs or their designee prior to distribution and should contain content that is mandatory for the entire campus to know.
The second is through departmental lists created from the four main distributions lists.
All students, faculty or staff may opt out of these departmental lists on an annual basis.
All offices wishing to send broadcast email messages to campus can do so through these lists created specifically for their needs.
Messages distributed through these departmental lists are done so at the discretion of the department.

Student information must be protected whether the student is physically present on campus, enrolled in a distance education or correspondence course, or is a continuing education student.

Exceptions University employees who are unable to comply with this policy must request an exception.
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the CIO based on academic or business need.
Anyone wishing to purchase services outside of the University approved solution(s) must submit a copy of the proposed contract with the service provider, including, but not limited to the applicable privacy policy, to the University s Senior Contracts Administrator for review by OIT and other appropriate University departments prior to purchase.
A security review of the service must be conducted and meet or exceed industry standards for the use requested.
The CIO will review exceptions annually for continued application and notify the exception holder of any concerns.

Consequences of Misuse of Resources Immediate consequences of suspected or actual policy violation required to prevent or deter further misuse may include account locking, network access loss, and quota restrictions.
Suspected violations must be reported to the OIT Help Desk at 214-768-4357 or by email at help@smu.edu.
In addition, employees found to be in violation of this policy or University Policy 8.2, Information Security, may be subject to discipline in accordance with University Policies 2.1, Standards of Professional Ethics for Faculty and Academic Freedom, 2.17, Procedural Standards for Faculty Sanctions and Dismissals, 7.23, Personal Conduct, 7.24, Corrective Action for Staff, and 7.28, Dishonest, Fraudulent and Illegal Practices, as applicable, up to and including termination of employment with the University.
Third parties, including vendors and guests, in violation of University Policies may be subject to reduced service or denied service, or otherwise restricted in their ability to conduct business with the University.
Students found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to discipline in accordance with the SMU Student Code of Conduct.

The wireless network is an extension of MSUM's wired network infrastructure, which provides increased mobility and flexibility for campus network users.
The network consists of a number of 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n compatible wireless access points throughout campus.
What do the wireless networks allow me to do?
Students, faculty, and staff can use the MSUM wireless networks to access the Internet and MSUM resources, such as e-mail, without having to plug into a wired jack.
Can I use any Internet application I have on my computer?
Yes, although network bandwidth is regulated for peer-to-peer music sharing programs.
You are advised not to set up shared folders without passwords.
We also recommend having antivirus software and firewall software installed on your computer.
Who can use this service?
Any current student, faculty or staff member with an active StarID username can use the wireless network.
You must know your password.
Community patrons are not granted access.
Visiting presenters and scholars must request guest access through the help desk.
Is wireless access available in the residence halls?
Yes it
However, this access is not part of the MSUM wireless network.
Please contact the Housing office to determine the steps in getting it setup.
What are the requirements for using MSUM wireless networks?
You must be a current student, staff or faculty member with an active StarID username.
How do I set up MSUM wireless networks?
Information on requirements for use and instructions on how to set up a wireless network are provided on the MSUM Wireless web site.
What hardware is required?
To use the wireless network, a laptop computer or other portable device is needed with 802.11b or 802.11g wireless capabilities.
What kind of wireless card should I buy?
Any 802.11a or 802.11g network card should work with the MSUM wireless networks.
g cards are backward compatible and will work with 802.11b access points you may have at home and vice versa.
What operating systems are compatible?
Supported operating systems include Windows or newer, and MacOS 10.2.8 or newer.
Will my built-in wireless card work?
Some computer companies offer built-in products with laptops and handheld devices as an optional feature.
As long as the products are compatible with the 802.11b or 802.11g standards, they should work with the MSUM wireless networks, though performance may vary.
Do I still need a regular(wired) Ethernet card?
Generally, the answer is yes.
Most mobile users will want to use their computer on the wired network where available, in addition to the wireless networks.
Wireless makes a great choice when the need for flexibility and mobility is required and also for basic Internet activities, but it is not as desirable when transferring large files or performing many simultaneous network activities.
Can I set up a wireless network?

Setting up wireless access point on campus(non residence halls) is PROHIBITED.
Wireless technology is easy to deploy but is also easily misconfigured and can interfere with other MSUM provided wireless access devices.
In addition, access points can act as routers or DHCP servers if configured incorrectly, which can disrupt service to other network users.
They also can compromise security and privacy, because anyone within range of an unsecured access point could collect traffic.
Essentially, open wireless networks allow unauthorized access to the university network resources.
If wireless access is not available in an on campus area and you feel it should be, contact the MSUM IT department.
Issues of security and privacy eclipse other issues, because anyone within range of an unsecured access point could collect traffic.
Any port that is found to have an unauthorized access point attached will be shut down and disciplinary action will be sought.
How secure is the wireless network?
Wireless network security is a serious issue.
Wireless is not only a shared medium, but also a medium that is broadcast via radio waves.
Therefore, anyone with a wireless card could monitor network traffic, which could include passwords and account numbers, unless traffic is encrypted.
MSUM does use encryption via the use of a CISCO VPN Client on the DragonConnect-Employees and DragonConnect-Student options ONLY.
DragonConnect-Public is NOT encrypted and should be considered unsecured.
What are 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g?
a, 802.11b and 802.11g are standards in regard to wireless communication that have been developed by the IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers).
The IEEE is an international organization that develops standards for hundreds of electronic and electrical technologies.
The organization uses a series of numbers, like the Dewey Decimal system in libraries, to differentiate between the various technology families.
The 802 committee develops standards for local and wide area networks(LANs and WANs).
is then further divided.
b, or Wi-Fi, is a standard for wireless LANs operating in the 2.4 GHz spectrum with a maximum shared bandwidth of 11 Mbps(megabits per second).
a is a different standard for wireless LANs operating in the GHz frequency range with a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.
Another standard, 802.11g, is for WLANs operating in the 2.4 GHz frequency but with a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.
g uses the same technology as 802.11b but the bandwidth(speed) has increased.
Does wireless interfere with other devices?
Yes, any 2.4GHz device that is near the wireless access point or wireless card can affect the performance and may shut off your network connection.
These devices are usually microwave ovens in close range, cordless phones, cameras and other 2.4GHz wireless devices.
Unauthorized access points can also interfere with the MSUM wireless network.

In addition, files, e-mail, access logs, and any other electronic records may be subject to search under court order.

E-Mail Usage SMCC recognizes the utilization of electronic communications as an efficient and necessary method of conducting business and advancing its mission of education.
Electronic mail(e-mail) should be used with the same care and discretion as any other type of official college communication.
The SMCC e-mail system is not a private secure communications medium.
As such, e-mail users cannot expect privacy.
By using the SMCC e-mail system, each user acknowledges: The use of electronic mail is a privilege not a right.
E-mail is for college communication, research, or campus business.
Transmitting certain types of communications is expressly forbidden.
This includes messages containing chain letters, pyramids, urban legends, and alarming hoaxes; vulgar, obscene or sexually explicit language; threatening or offensive content; derogatory, defamatory, sexual, or other harassment; and discriminatory communication of any kind.
As with other information technology resources, the use of e-mail for commercial or political purposes is strictly prohibited.
Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, tampering with e-mail, interfering with the delivery of e-mail, and using e-mail for criminal purposes may be felony offenses, requiring the disclosure of messages to law enforcement or other third parties without notification.
E-mail messages should be transmitted only to those individuals who have a need to receive them.
Distribution lists should be constructed and used carefully.
E-mail distribution lists should be kept current and updated regularly.
Inappropriate mass mailing is forbidden.
This includes multiple mailings to newsgroups, mailing lists, or individuals(e.g.
spamming," "flooding," or "bombing").
All users of the SMCC e-mail system waive any right to privacy in e-mail messages and consent to the access and disclosure of e-mail messages by authorized college personnel.
Accordingly, the college reserves the right to access and disclose the contents of e-mail messages on a need-to-know basis.

Wireless Network Usage SMCC provides wireless network access at various points around the campus.
As such, these wireless networks are subject to the same policies and restrictions as wired networks.
Use of wireless networks constitutes an agreement by the student to abide by the SMCC Acceptable Use Policy.
It is the policy of SMCC to forbid the use of any P2P or sharing softwaredamage, or remove any of the network security measures currently in place on the campus networks.
Users who violate this policy will have their computer blocked from accessing the wireless network for days and will need to remove the software from their computer before being allowed to use the service again.
A second violation will result in the user being barred from wireless access for 30 days.
If the user violates the policy a third time, the individual computer will be permanently blocked from accessing the SMCC network.

Private Computers Connected to the SMCC Network The following apply to anyone connecting a private computer to the SMCC network, wireless LAN connection, or a regular network connection in an office or residence hall.
The owner of the computer is responsible for the behavior of all users on the computer, and all network traffic to and from the computer, whether or not the owner knowingly generates the traffic.
A private computer connected to the network may not be used to provide network access for anyone who is not authorized to use the college systems.
The private computer may not be used as a router or bridge between the SMCC network and external networks, such as those of an Internet Service Provider.
Should the SMCC IT staff have any reason to believe that a private computer connected to the SMCC network is using the resources inappropriately, network traffic to and from that computer will be monitored.
If justified, the system will be disconnected from the network, and appropriate action will be taken.
Any residential student, with an authorized network account, may use the SMCC network connection for scholarly purposes, for official college business, and for personal use, so long as the usage:
does not violate any law or this policy, b. does not involve extraordinarily high utilization of college resources or substantially interfere with the performance of the SMCC network, and c. does not result in commercial gain or profit.
Due to the possibility of a breach in the college's computer network security, students are not permitted to connect a computer to the SMCC network and an external Internet Service Provider
Students who prefer to use an external ISP must notify SMCC IT prior to connecting to the external ISP network.
Users are responsible for the security and integrity of their systems.
In cases where a computer is "hacked into," it is recommended that the system be either shut down or be removed from the campus network as soon as possible to localize any potential damage and to stop the attack from spreading.
If you suspect electronic intrusion or hacking of your system and would like assistance, contact the SMCC IT department immediately.
The following types of servers should never be connected to the SMCC network: DNS, DHCP, BOOTP, WINS, or any other server that manages network addresses.

Penalties If a user is suspected of violating this Policy, SMCC may confiscate any equipment, device, software, documents, or data that is involved.
If an individual has violated the Policy, he/she will incur the same types of disciplinary measures as violations of other SMCC policies.
Violation of state or federal free/statutes may lead to criminal or civil prosecution.
Students: Campus disciplinary measures may include, but are not limited to, failure in a class, permanent or temporary loss of information technology privileges, suspension or expulsion from SMCC, and restitution of expenses as well as charges for damages.
Faculty and Staff: Campus disciplinary measures may include, but are not limited to, reassignment of duties, transfer, censure, suspension, termination, and restitution of expenses as well as charges for damages.
Off-campus Users: The college may revoke the privileges of users who are found to be in violation and may report any serious violation to the users home campus authorities and to appropriate law enforcement officials.

Unfortunately, the use of computing resources can be used improperly, sometimes quite unintentionally and, in rare instances, deliberately.
Accordingly, for both your personal benefit and the benefit of others, you must assume responsibility for making the best possible use of your privileges and for not abusing them. Computers and networks can provide access to resources on and off campus, as well as the ability to communicate with other users worldwide.
Such open access is a privilege, and requires that individuals act responsibly.
Users must respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. You are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your account.
IT Services grants permission to members of the UCLA community to use computing resources by issuing individual computing accounts including UCLA Logon IDs.
As a condition of receiving access to BOL services, you must observe the following guidelines: Use the facility in accordance with established policies and procedures.
Although UCLA Logon IDs are intended to be used for academic purposes, these accounts may be used for incidental personal use but not as a primary connection to the network/internet for individual or business units. Make economical and wise use of the facility resources that are shared with others, thus enabling access to these resources by the greatest possible number of users.
Make judicious use of one of the scarcest resources - the dial up modems. You must assume the responsibility for backing up your data and programs.
Protect important data and programs stored on tape or disk by duplicating them on backup tapes. Misuse of computing, networking, or information resources may result in the loss of computing privileges.
Additionally, misuse of a computing account will require financial restitution to the University for funds expended and could result in University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action. Users may be held accountable for their conduct under any applicable University or campus policies, procedures, or collective bargaining agreements.
Any actions which deter other users from doing their work or which would otherwise be deemed malicious by IT Services will result in the loss of access to the system and possible University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action. Both unauthorized use of the computer and use for personal gain constitute theft under California law and will be prosecuted by the University.
Furthermore, entering the computer facility with the intent, by whatever means, of discovering another's account number for purposes of stealing computer time constitutes burglary under California law and will be prosecuted. In support of the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service, Information Technology Services provides computing, networking, and information resources to UCLA's students, faculty, and staff.
IT Services provides the UCLA community with access to local, national, and international sources of information in an atmosphere that encourages sharing of information, access to a rich collection of services, and open and free discussion for academic purposes and other University-related uses.
For both your personal benefit and the benefit of others, you must assume responsibility for making the best possible use of your privileges and for not abusing them.
All existing laws(federal and state) and University regulations and policies apply, including not only those laws and regulations that are specific to computers and networks, but also those that may apply generally to personal conduct.

Internet Bandwidth Management Stevenson University uses bandwidth management services in an attempt to make Internet usage as equitable as possible for everyone.
These safeguards ensure that an individual or small group of users cannot degrade the Internet connectivity of the campus community.
This makes it possible for large numbers of residents to be able to watch streaming services like Netflix while at the same time others can play online games, browse the web, download large files, or complete class assignments and research.
We also prioritize Internet traffic giving academic use priority over entertainment use.
Bandwidth management was necessitated because it was determined that small numbers of students were monopolizing an inordinate amount of the campus bandwidth and thus impacting other students.
Stevenson University has elaborate tools to monitor the wired and wireless networks, as well as our multiple Internet links.
If a student reports an issue regarding connectivity or throughput, we can monitor their specific traffic and diagnose the issue to bring about a quick resolution.
Remember, it is against University policy to use the SU network for illegal or offensive content, or to use the network resources in any manner that conflicts with the Acceptable Use Policy to which you have agreed.
Using the University network or Internet bandwidth to conduct non-University business is not permitted.
Students are not permitted to run a web server from their dorm room or host content for access by others, such as movies, music and games.
It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, and national or ethnic origin in the administration of its education policies, admission policies, scholarship and loan programs, and other university-administered programs.
The University is committed to providing all students with an educational environment free of bias, discrimination, intimidation, or harassment.
In this regard, Stevenson University complies with all relevant federal, state, and local laws.
The University also complies with all applicable laws and federal regulations regarding prohibition of discrimination and accessibility on the basis of age, disability, veteran status, or otherwise.

Definitions: Mobile device: any electronic device with the ability to transmit or receive data, text, and/or voice, via a University-approved cellular network.
This includes but is not limited to smartphones, cellular equipped tablets and phablets, laptops, and mi-fi cellular cards.
Communication device: Includes all mobile(cellular) devices as defined above as well as other communications devices including, but not limited to land line telephones, two- way radios, and beepers.

Policy Assigning a University Issued Mobile Device The IT Director of the College or Division will recommend who qualifies for a University issued cellular device following a University-wide standard scoring rubric.
Final determination is subject to a Dean or Division Head s review and approval.
A user who qualifies for a device may not automatically be assigned a device at the discretion of the Dean or Division Head, as individual needs and departmental resources may vary.
The IT Director, with input from the leadership within the College or Division, will determine device assignments offering users choices where possible.
Single Mobile Device Assignment Policy With proper authorization, a University employee may be issued one(1) mobile device with enabled cellular service.
Employees needing to connect multiple devices to either the Internet or a cellular service provider should work with their IT Departments, ITS or Telecommunications as appropriate for alternative solutions and technologies.
Such technologies may include smart phone tethering or a temporarily assigned Mi-Fi access point.
Employees who dual report to two or more departments and are assigned a University smart or flip phone shall be issued one(1) cellular device, with costs allocated between the two departments as mutually agreed Records Management of a University-Assigned Mobile or Communication Device All University device service usage detail records produced by assigned mobile devices are property of the University and managed by the University.
Usage summary reports( e.
number of minutes or GB of data used) are distributed to supervisors regularly and are periodically reviewed.
Detailed usage reports are available to any supervisor upon request by contacting Telecommunications.
If the Employee s college IT Director, Dean or Division Head concurs that an employee need exists, she or he may authorize a University issued communications device to be provided by the IT Director.
The University understands that some minimal amount of personal use of a University provided land line or cellular phone is inevitable.
However a University mobile device is intended for business use only.
Personal Communications Devices and University Business If a user elects to use his or her personal device for University business, he/she may do
The University does not offer per-call reimbursement or stipend a user for personal monthly cellular service usage.
The Security Standard must be adhered to by all University-Issued Mobile Devices and their Users at all times.
University-Issued Services on Personal Communication Devices: Standards If an individual elects to attach a personally owned communications device to a University IT system, such as University operated email systems, he/she is required to adhere to the Mobile Device Security Standard found on ITS website at http://its.syr.edu.
Mobile Device Upgrade Frequency and Schedule Policy University owned mobile devices may be upgraded two years from original purchase.
If a business need exists that requires the device to be upgraded sooner than two years, the employee may discuss initially with their IT Director, and then with their Dean, or Division Head.
If the device is broken or otherwise inoperable and no device that is capable of performing similar University business is available at Excess Property, the Colleges or Division s IT Director may recommend an upgrade.
A University employee wishing to upgrade their assigned cellular device may not use another employee s cellular device upgrade schedule to upgrade their assigned cellular device.
Employee-Owned Device Purchase Option According to University Service Plan Procedure, Employees wishing to upgrade their University assigned cellular device sooner than the approved two year time period are free to purchase their IT Director approved device out-of-pocket and attach such device to a University cellular service plan.
The cellular phone number becomes the property of the University and may be transferred back to the employee upon termination or resignation of the employee-based on recommendations made by Telecommunications and the Home College or Division.
The employee will retain ownership of their cellular device.
The University will not be responsible for any maintenance, 3rd party products such as Bluetooth devices or any communications options.
The employee will be required to adhere to all usage limits and policies outlined in the section labeled Personal Use of University-Provided Communications Devices including reasonable usage and usage reimbursement provisions.
Switching of a cellular carrier solely to upgrade a device before the two year cycle is not allowed.

These resources include a high-speed local area network, access to shared network software and storage space, public computing facilities, support services, on-line library databases, access to the Internet, and more.
Access to these resources is granted to all Whittier faculty, staff and currently-enrolled students.
By sharing and using these resources, users accept full responsibility for their actions and agree that they will use these resources in an ethical manner.
Because we are an academic community, the faculty, students and staff of Whittier College honor intellectual property, respect the privacy of data, and respect the rights of others.
As a carrier of information, Whittier College does not subject users' files to prior review.
However, the College does make its best effort to educate the community in responsible use and respond when violations are pointed out.
College resources are provided solely for the education and research mission of Whittier College and may not be used for commercial or for-profit purposes.
Users who express opinions and positions through the College's IT resources must make clear that these opinions and positions are those of the individual who posts them, not of the College.
Because the College is the owner of all IT resources granted to users, the College reserves the right to deny use to those who have used them in an irresponsible manner.
Offenders may also be subject to disciplinary action through existing structures for faculty, students and staff of the College, as laid out in the relevant College handbooks.
People who use both on-campus and external network media(including any communication performed on the network for any purpose) must do so responsibly, in a manner that constitutes respectful behavior as laid out in the Faculty, Student and Staff Handbooks.
It is unethical not to adhere to this type of behavior, even when communicating with people outside the Whittier community.
For example, no form of harassment, as defined in the Student, Faculty and Staff Handbooks, will be tolerated within any media.
In addition, all communications must include the sender's complete network or email address, unless the service explicitly invites anonymous communication.
If someone requests you to stop communicating electronically with him/her, you are required to do so immediately.
Students accessing "social networking services" such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and others should carefully read the terms and conditions set forth by such services.
Students are solely responsible for the content of their sites.
Anonymous" gossip sites, many of which are created for use by a specific college campus population, permit the posting of messages without identification of the sender and are not authorized or controlled by Whittier College.
We discourage all students from visiting these sites and from participating in the negative, damaging outcomes irresponsible use creates.
Neither IT Services nor Whittier College assume any responsibility for what users place there.
Each information technology resource those existing on campus as well as external ones to which we are connected has an owner.
Attempts, even unsuccessful ones, to use or access any resource without the permission of the owner are a violation of this policy.
All students and employees must respect conditions of access and use stipulated by the owner.
Although individuals are not the owners of accounts assigned to them(the College is the owner), they are the owners of the files they create, and have rights to privacy and responsibilities to control access by others you must respect others rights when you communicate with them over networks.
Anything less than adherence to the letter and spirit of copyright laws and regulations is unethical and possibly illegal.
Users must obtain permission of the creator or publisher to copy materials created by others.
Users must abide by license agreements controlling copying and use of software and data.
Network Admission Control(NAC) Before you can use the campus data network you must first install a NAC software agent.
The installation process will happen automatically when you connect your computer to the network and open a browser.
NAC has three goals: it associates your computer's electronic address with you, in case we need to contact you about network issues; it safeguards that your computer has software running on it to protect your system from outside threats, like viruses and spyware; and it ensures that your system is not a threat to other computers on campus by being vulnerable to(or even currently infected by) viruses and spyware.
To this end, NAC requires that you install all operating system updates and patches, and have up-to-date anti-virus programs.
It is extremely important to install all updates when they become available.
Whittier College provides a professional-quality virus scanner to students for free.
You can download it and other software we provide from the IT Services website.
Most game consoles and many handheld wireless devices(e.g.
iPhone, iPad, Droid) are known to work with our campus network.
You may need to manually register these devices by contacting the IT Services Help Desk.
Network Vulnerability Responses "Compromised computers" are those that have been infected by threatening worms or viruses, have been hacked, or for some other reason interfere with normal network operation.
Compromised computers cause grave threat to other computers sharing the network segment by emitting interfering data and/or retransmitting worms and viruses.
Computers can be compromised unbeknownst to the owner if left without preventative software.
Should IT Services detect a disruptive device on the College network, its network connection will be disabled until it is removed or repaired.
Wireless access devices" are units which, when plugged into our network, emit a radio signal permitting properly equipped computers to access the network.
Misconfigured access devices sometimes mimic the actions of central network control equipment and disrupt network access by other users of the network segment, possibly an entire residence hall.
Such devices are not supported and are not to be connected to the College network.
Should IT Services detect a disruptive wireless access device, its network connection will be disabled until it is removed.
Copying Code of Ethics Because we are an academic community, the faculty, students and staff of Whittier College honor intellectual property, respect the privacy of data and recognize the rights of others.
Each individual has a responsibility in turn to use copying technology in an ethical manner.
Anything less than adherence to the letter and spirit of copyright laws and regulations is unethical.
Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital to academic discourse and enterprise.
This principle applies to works of all authors and publishers in media.
It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledge, right to privacy and right to determine the form, manner and terms of publication and distribution.
Because printed and recorded information is easily reproduced, respect for the work and personal expression of others is critical.
Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism, invasion of privacy, unauthorized access and trade secret and copyright violations, may be grounds for sanctions against members of the academic community.
At Whittier College, violation of the Copying Code of Ethics may subject the offender to disciplinary action.
7, 101 and 106) grants all rights of public exhibition of a copyrighted work to the owner of the copyright.
Such rights of public exhibition include the right to show a film, videotape, or DVD to a group, whether or not admission is charged.
Congressional reports on copyright applications make clear that even "semi-public" exhibitions in residence halls, clubs and colleges are classified as public for copyright purposes.
The College has determined that public or semi-public showing of films, videotapes, or DVDs without written permission or license, is prohibited on campus.
Contact Media Services for additional information.
Organizations and individuals desiring to show videotapes, films, or DVDs must secure permission from the holder of the copyright.
Generally, this means that videotapes, films, or DVDs must be rented from companies who hold the rights.
Neighborhood video stores do not hold these rights.
Even if a tape or DVD has been purchased and is owned by a member of the community, it may not be shown outside of the student's room.
Criminal penalty for willful violation of the Copyright Act is up to one year in jail and/or a $25,000 fine.
Inadvertent or innocent violations may bring substantial civil penalties.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act(DMCA) of 1998 and the Higher Education Opportunity Act(HEOA) of 2008 demand effective response by the College when we are notified of potential copyright violations on our campus most commonly, music and movie files being distributed without the owners' permission.
Copyright owners and their agents often scan file-sharing networks, such as BitTorrent, looking for such files and their sources.
When these groups complain to the College about potential violations coming from our campus, the DMCA and HEOA require that we respond quickly and thoroughly.
We have therefore developed the following policy on how to respond to notices about potential violations: IT Services will positively identify you from the notice and you will be notified of the infraction, the infringed work and your next actions.
Your access to the College's network is suspended and the Dean of Students Office is notified.
You are required to remove the file sharing application and the infringed work before your network access is restored.
The Dean of Students Office may contact you regarding this infringement as a student conduct violation.
After your computer has ceased the sharing of copyrighted works, we can restore your network access.
Indemnification Users agree, in consideration of access to the College's technology resources and services, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Whittier College and its trustees, employees, agents, and subcontractors from and against any claims, suits, actions, and proceedings from any and all third parties arising from such access.
Additional Information Any questions regarding the ethical and legal use of Whittier College's technology resources should be directed to IT Services at(562) 907-4287.
Any modification to this policy will be posted on the college web site.
To report an accessibility issue, a website problem, or submit feedback, please submit a Website Feedback Form.

The University reserves the right to remove from its network and website any material that is an unauthorized or improper use of its resources, or in violation of or inconsistent with this policy.
The campus network, including its servers and associated software, and all pages of the University website is the property of Washington and Lee University.
Neither the network pathways nor W&L-owned computer systems are to be used: for purposes incompatible with established University policies, procedures, protocols or applicable laws; for unauthorized commercial enterprise; for harassing, fraudulent, or threatening purposes; or for pirating software, music or images.
The following activities are nonexclusive examples of those that are not permitted and that may lead to suspension or revocation of use privileges and other penalties or discipline: unauthorized access, attempts to gain unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or violation of the University's Confidentiality Policy involving the University's computing and network resources; misrepresenting or attempting to misrepresent one's identity; altering or tampering with the configuration of computers in student labs and other common areas, or installing unauthorized games or other programs on their hard disks or on the shared-files area of the file servers; any network activity that impedes the flow of network traffic, significantly diminishes the availability of resources to other users, or imposes avoidable burdens on other users(for example, sending mass e-mails instead of using the appropriate services available for communicating with the entire community or large sub-groups); or the unauthorized physical or virtual extension or re-configuration of any portion of the campus network by such means as routers(wired or wireless), wireless access points, network wiring, or other methods.
Students, faculty, staff, and volunteers with access to confidential data are reminded of the University's Confidentiality Policy.
Among other things, the policy states that electronic documents and files containing confidential information are to be accessed, used, and disclosed only with explicit authorization and only on a need to know basis for either an employee's job functions or volunteer's service.

Use of University Website and Official University Social Media Accounts The University's website(including all unit, division, department, and program pages on the University's website) is intended to facilitate the communication of information about and from Washington and Lee University, speaking as an institution, to the campus community as well as the larger world.
The website is ideally suited for static content and the presentation of consistent information for current and prospective students and employees, such as curricular and/or academic information, official University announcements(visiting speakers, symposia, etc.
and information related to University recruitment, engagement and fundraising.
All content on the University's website must be consistent with the Faculty Handbook statements on " Academic Freedom."
The University's social media accounts fall into two categories: official and unofficial.
Official university social media accounts are only those operated by the Office of Communications and Public Affairs, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, the Office of Alumni Affairs, Sports Information, and the School of Law.
Departments and organizations may have social media accounts, but these are not official University accounts and do not speak for the University in any official capacity.
All student organization accounts are considered unofficial.
The University does not manage or oversee unofficial platforms nor is the University responsible for the content of such platforms.
See Guidelines and Best Practices for Social Media Use and best practices when posting on an official or unofficial social media account.)
Revision History Revised: 12/2002; 2/2006; 12/15/2008 8/20/2018: Updated to clarify use of the University's website and official University social media accounts.
This access is granted subject to University policies, local, state, and federal laws.
Systems and resources are provided primarily for academic use.
Network usage for other activities such as personal communications, gaming or entertainment may be prioritized to ensure we meet our academic goals.
Acceptable use is always ethical, reflects academic honesty, and shows restraint in the consumption of shared resources.
It demonstrates respect for intellectual property, ownership of intellectual property, system security mechanisms, and individuals' rights to privacy and to freedom from intimidation and harassment.
Violation of this or other policies as outlined in the Student or Faculty/Employee handbooks may result in the loss of network privileges.
In addition, the obtaining or distributing of material protected under United States or international copyright laws using electronic, paper or other media without the proper permission is illegal and can result in the loss of library, network or other privileges and may also result in criminal prosecution by the responsible authorities.
Connecting a personal device to the Virginia Wesleyan University network, either by direct Ethernet connection or via our wireless(802.11) network obligates the owner/user to comply with this Acceptable Use policy.
By connecting your device(phone, computer, tablet, smart TV or gaming console) to the VWU network we will be able to monitor the usage and content of messages and web sites visited.
Although we do not routinely examine the content of this activity we are constantly monitoring the overall usage of the network to improve the services to the community.

This service allows members of the University community to access the campus-wide network from mobile or portable computers(and select personal digital assistants) where coverage is available.
Accidental or intentional disruption of a wireless network will deprive others of access to important University resources.
To provide this service, the radio frequency airspace of the University serves as the transport medium for this technology.
Wireless networks operate on the campus shared and finite airspace spectrum.
Current wireless Ethernet is based upon products that use the Federal Communications Commission radio frequency bands of 2.4 GHz and 5GHz.
Wireless transmissions within these bands conform to the IEEE 802.11b DSSS(Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g wireless LAN specifications.
Other wireless products also exist in the marketplace that use these same 2.4 GHz and 5GHz frequency bands but do not conform to these standards.
Such products can cause interference to wireless service and can prevent University users from obtaining or maintaining network connectivity.
These devices include, but are not limited to, other IEEE wireless LAN devices, bluetooth products, cordless telephones, wireless video cameras, and wireless audio speakers.
Certain wireless LAN products are also more susceptible to unauthorized access due to encryption and security flaws.]
Therefore, UMass Amherst Information Technologies(UMass Amherst IT) will regulate and manage this airspace to ensure its fair and efficient allocation and to prevent collision, interference, unauthorized intrusion and failure.
In addition, central management will facilitate the adoption of new features.
Persons using wireless devices to connect to the University network must be aware of this, and comply with the policies outlined herein.
UMass Amherst IT will approach the shared use of the wireless radio frequencies in the same way that it manages the shared use of the wired network.
All provisions of the University policies regarding computing, including the UMass Amherst IT Acceptable Use Policy, apply equally to both wired and wireless networking.
Specific issues pertaining to wireless network devices are outlined below: Only access points provided and installed by UMass Amherst IT or approved by UMass Amherst IT are permitted on the University network or the campus.
A consultation with UMass Amherst IT is available to assist with questions, and UMass Amherst IT can provide access points to departments for non-public spaces on a fee for service basis.
Contact John Doyle, Umass Amherst IT, john.doyle@umass.edu for specific information and pricing.
All access points will be installed and configured in such a way as to comply with all security features of the wireless network, including restrictions to provide connections only to those users who are entitled to access as members of the University community.
The University reserves the right to remove or disconnect any access point not installed and configured by UMass Amherst IT personnel or specifically covered by prior written agreement and/or arrangement with UMass Amherst
In cases where the device is being used for specific teaching or research applications, UMass Amherst IT will work with faculty to determine how the wireless devices may be used while maintaining required security and without causing interference.
Other devices such as portable phones, and wireless devices using "Bluetooth"(a competing wireless technology), that broadcast and receive information on the same frequency as wireless Ethernet devices may not be allowed on the network, due to the possibility of interference.
If reports of disruptions caused by such devices occur, the circumstances will be investigated and could result in removal of the device, with the determination to be made by UMass Amherst
Only users affiliated with the University of Massachusetts at Amherst are authorized to use wireless networking on campus.
To help protect these affiliated users from unauthorized access to their computer resources, UMass Amherst IT may implement data encryption and authentication security measures that must be followed by all users.
These measures require the use of specific wireless LAN product types and are designed to meet emerging wireless encryption and security standards.
GENERAL STATEMENT Goucher College honors and recognizes each person's freedom of expression and action.
With this freedom come responsibilities, including consideration of others, academic integrity, and a commitment to the value of truth.
Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital in an academic environment.
At Goucher, we respect the right to privacy, the right of attribution and acknowledgement; the rights of copyright holders and the doctrine of fair use; and the right of an author to determine the form, manner, and terms of publication and distribution of works in all media, including electronic media.
Since electronic information is so accessible and so easily reproduced, respect for personal expression is especially important in computer and electronic environments.
Violation of authorial integrity, including plagiarism, invasion of privacy, unauthorized access to computing resources or electronic information, and violations of copyright law and trade secrets, are serious matters and may be grounds for appropriate sanctions.
Consequences for violating this policy may include civil or criminal liability under federal and state laws, as well as the entire range of Goucher administrative sanctions detailed under "Penalties," below.
Goucher College acquires, develops, and maintains computers, computer and telecommunications systems, networks, and other information technology resources, including, but not limited to, computers, printers, modems, email, fax transmissions, video, multi-media, classroom technologies, telephony and administrative systems.
These resources are intended for direct and indirect support of the college's instruction, research, and service missions; of the college's administrative functions; and of student and campus life activities.
Access to these resources, whether from on-campus or from a remote location, is a privilege and is subject to the requirements of applicable laws and policies and the highest standards of ethical behavior.
Particular uses of any of these resources are not made legitimate simply because those uses may be technologically possible.

POLICY
All devices connected to the university network(regardless of media type) must support the university mission and initiatives.
The integrity, security, and proper operation of LUnet are the fundamental priorities of the CIO/VP of ITS and ITIS.
Part of that operation is the task of protecting these devices against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction.
Network access, performance, and security are put at risk when devices are introduced into the network environment without appropriate coordination and compatibility verification.]
ITIS shall manage all connections to LUnet with due consideration for accessibility, performance, privacy, compatibility, and security.
Individuals or departments are NOT permitted to deploy any device or mechanism which would allow the extension or isolation of LUnet.

Lamar University ITS with ITIS owns and operates all IP addresses for LUnet.
These include both public(internet routable) and private(non-internet routable) address spaces.
The address designation for networks shall be determined by the purpose of the network towards These addresses are commonly assigned by an ITS DHCP service, which dynamically assigns these addresses to individual user devices and network devices, when requested on LUnet.
DHCP is the standard and preferred method for assigning IP addresses to campus user devices.
Device owners or device administrators desiring a static(reserved) IP address may have to demonstrate why DHCP is inadequate for their purpose.
Those denied static IP addresses may appeal to the Director of ITIS and then to the Chief Information Officer whose decision is final.
ITIS reserves the right to change static IP addresses periodically to address new or modified university requirements.
ITIS will notify statically addressed device owners or devices administrators in advance of pending changes to those addresses.

Lamar University ITS with ITIS owns and operates all root resolvers(DNS services) for LUnet(lamar.edu domain).
These include forward and reverse resolvers.
Campus departments may obtain sub domain delegations for their departments by contacting ITIS.

Network device equipment examples include but are not limited to: routers switches hubs firewall appliances wireless access points virtual private network(VPN) servers network address translators(NAT) proxy servers dial-up servers active/passive sniffers wiretaps or surveillance equipment
ITIS will disconnect a device posing an immediate threat to LUnet in order to isolate the intrusion or problem and minimize risk to other systems.
Any user devices or network devices may be removed from LUnet if the traffic emanating from the device has been deemed a threat to the university or any of the other devices connected to LUnet.
ITIS and SOC will disconnect devices involved in repeated incidents until it has been determined they are safe for reconnection to LUnet as required to reduce security risks to an acceptable level.

ITIS may disconnect and confiscate any unauthorized network devices.
Personal software firewalls are permitted as long as these firewalls do not interfere with university services designed to assess security posture of connected devices.
Network attached peripheral equipment such as printers, scanners, and similar devices are allowed where appropriate and with approval from Lamar ITS.
ITIS reserves the right to monitor the traffic and audit state owned devices, systems, and general network traffic in accordance with Appropriate Use Policy number 10.01.01.

The use of user devices and network devices connected to the LUnet is accompanied by certain responsibilities.
Users, device administrators, and device owners are accountable for their user device or network device connected to LUnet.
Device owners are responsible for ensuring timely updates of applications, operating systems, and virus protection software to minimize risks of system compromise.
ITIS may provide non-intrusive products and services for achieving such updates for university owned equipment.]

The wired component of the LUnet is unencrypted.
Device owner and device administrators that utilize this network to transmit sensitive, restricted, or confidential information are responsible for the security of that information as it traverses the network.
Privacy of data traversing this network cannot be guaranteed.
Examples of available protections include encrypted protocols such as SSL, IPsec, SSH, etc.
Contact the SOC for assistance in implementing the necessary protective measures.

The university requires the registration of servers connected to LUnet by the device owner or device administrator.
The guidelines for this are listed in Policy 10.03.01 Server Management
All unregistered public facing servers will be considered unauthorized devices and are subject to disconnection from LUnet by ITIS or SOC.

Metadata information about all university network traffic shall be logged and used for analysis towards improving performance of network services.
Retention of these logs shall follow university retention guidelines unless superseded by state or federal laws.

Scanning, sniffing or capture of any part of network communications is strictly prohibited except for ITS personnel responsible for network and/or security operations.
Exemptions can be granted with explicit written approval from the CIO / VP of ITS or their designee.

Lamar University ITS with ITIS reserves the right to segment internal network communications to optimize network flow within the campus network.
These optimizations include but are not limited to interior segmentation, firewalls, traffic shaping and blocking of traffic.

Lamar University ITS with SOC may scan both secured and insecure network communication protocols for detection and suppression of malware for prevention and mitigation of risk from network-based malware.

Lamar University ITS with ITIS in conjunction with the office of ISO shall establish a network perimeter as mandated by TAC 202.75 and deploy technology components including but not limited to DMZ, firewall, intrusion detection or prevention system, routers, application firewalls, malware scanners, DLP systems.

SYSTEM ACCESS CONTROL End-User Passwords Texas Wesleyan has an obligation to effectively protect the intellectual property and personal and financial information entrusted to it by students, employees, partners and others.
Using passwords that are difficult to guess is key step toward effectively fulfilling that obligation.
Any password used to access information stored and/or maintained by Texas Wesleyan must be at least characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter and one number or special character.
Approved 12/14/11 last updated July 22, 2014 NETWORK PROTECTION Page Passwords will expire annually - every 365 days.
When a password expires or a change is required, users should create a new password that is not identical to the last three passwords previously employed.
Passwords stored electronically may not be stored in readable form where unauthorized persons might discover them.
Passwords may not be written down and left in a place where unauthorized persons might discover them.
Passwords may never be shared or revealed to anyone other than the authorized user.
If a password is suspected of being disclosed or known to have been disclosed to anyone other than the authorized user, it should be changed immediately.
Password System Set-Up All computers permanently or intermittently connected to Texas Wesleyan local area networks must have password access controls.
If the computers contain confidential or protected information, an extended user authentication system approved by the Information Technology department must be used.
Multi-user systems(servers) should employ user IDs and passwords unique to each user, and user privilege restriction mechanisms with privileges based on an -connected, single-user systems must employ hardware or software controls approved by Information Technology that prevent unauthorized access.
All vendor-supplied default fixed passwords must be changed before any computer or communications system is used in production.
This policy applies to passwords associated with end-user user IDs and passwords associated with privileged user IDs.
Where systems software permits, the number of consecutive attempts to enter an incorrect password must be strictly limited.
After five unsuccessful attempts to enter a password, the involved user ID must be suspended until reset by a system administrator or temporarily disabled for no less than three minutes.
The VPN and Outlook Web Mail constant connections must have a time-out period of 30 minutes and should log out upon reaching the threshold.
Whenever system security has been compromised or if there is a reason to believe that it has been compromised, the involved system administrator must immediately take measures to ensure that passwords are properly protected.
This may involve resetting all user passwords and requiring users to change them prior to next system log
Whenever system security has been compromised or if there is a reason to believe that it has been compromised, the involved system administrator must take measures to restore the system to secure operation.
This may involve reloading a trusted version of the operating system and all security-related software from trusted storage media or original source-code disks/sites.
The involved system then would be rebooted.
All changes to user privileges taking effect since the time of suspected system compromise must be reviewed by the system administrator for unauthorized modifications.
Approved 12/14/11 last updated July 22, 2014 NETWORK PROTECTION Page All users must be positively identified prior to being able to use any Texas Wesleyan multi-user computer or communications system resources.
Positive identification for internal Texas Wesleyan networks involves a user ID and password, both of which are unique to an individual user, or an extended user authentication system.
Positive identification for all Internet and remote lines involves the use of an approved extended user authentication technique.
The combination of a user ID and fixed password does not provide sufficient security for Internet or remote connections to Texas Wesleyan systems or networks.
Modems, wireless access points, routers, switches or other devices attached to network-connected workstations located in Texas Wesleyan offices are forbidden unless they meet all technical requirements and have a user authentication system approved by the Information Technology department.
The logon process for network-connected Texas Wesleyan computer systems must simply ask the user to log on, providing prompts as needed.
Specific information about the organization managing the computer, the computer operating system, the network configuration, or other internal matters may not be provided until a user has successfully provided both a valid user ID and a valid password.
If there has been no activity on a computer terminal, workstation, or personal computer for a certain period of time, the system should automatically blank the screen and suspend the session.
Re-establishment of the session must take place only after the user has provided a valid password.
The recommended period of time is 30 minutes.
An exception to this policy will be made in those cases where the immediate area surrounding a system is physically secured by locked doors, secured-room badge readers, or similar technology or if the suspended session interferes with the ability of an instructor to complete his/her classroom instructional activities.
With the exception of electronic bulletin boards or other systems where all regular users are anonymous, users are prohibited from logging into any Texas Wesleyan system or network anonymously.
If users employ systems facilities that permit them to change the active user ID to gain certain privileges, they must have initially logged on employing a user ID that clearly indicates their identity or affiliation.
SYSTEM PRIVILEGES Limiting System Access The computer and communications system privileges of all users, systems, and independently-operating programs such as agents, must be restricted based on the need to know.
This means that privileges must not be extended unless a legitimate academic/business-oriented need for such privileges exists.
Default user file permissions must not automatically permit anyone on the system to read, write, execute or delete a system file.
Although users may reset permissions on a file-by-file basis, such permissive default file permissions are prohibited.
Default file permissions granted to limited groups of people who have a genuine need to know are permitted.
Users with personally-owned computers are responsible for administering a screen saver
Approved 12/14/11 last updated July 22, 2014 NETWORK PROTECTION Page applications and systems software that provide the capability of connecting to Texas Wesleyan resources.
Texas Wesleyan computer and communications systems must restrict access to the computers that users can reach over Texas Wesleyan networks.
These restrictions can be implemented through routers, gateways, firewalls, wireless access points, and other network components.
These restrictions must be used to, for example, control the ability of a user to log on to a certain computer then move from that computer to another.
Process for Granting System Privileges Requests for new user IDs and changed privileges must be in writing and approved by the these requests must be retained for a period of at least one year.
Individuals who are not Texas Wesleyan employees, students, or partners may not be granted a user ID or be given privileges to use Texas Wesleyan computers or networks unless the written approval of a current employee has been obtained and the employee agrees to full responsibility for all activities carried out by the individual(s) she or he is sponsoring.
This can be accomplished using the Sponsored Account Request form.
Privileges granted to users who are not Texas Wesleyan employees must be granted for periods of 180 days or less.
As needed, users who are not Texas Wesleyan employees must have their privileges reauthorized by the sponsoring department head every 180 days.
Special privileges, such as the default ability to write to the files of other users, must be restricted to those responsible for systems administration or systems security.
An exception to this policy may be made if there is a justified business/academic need and permission is acquired through the exception process, using the Exception form.
Configuration changes, operating system changes, and related activities that require system privileges must be performed by system administrators.
Third-party vendors must not be given Internet or remote privileges to Texas Wesleyan computers or networks unless the system administrator determines that they have a legitimate business/academic need.
These privileges must be enabled only for the time period required to accomplish the approved tasks, such as remote maintenance.
If a perpetual or long-term connection is required, then the connection must be established by approved extended user authentication methods.
All users wishing to use Texas Wesleyan internal networks or multi-user systems that are connected to Texas Wesleyan internal networks signify their agreement to comply with all applicable policies by their logon to the network.
Process for Revoking System Access All user IDs should have the associated privileges revoked after a certain period of inactivity not exceeding 180 days.
If a computer or communication system access control subsystem is not functioning properly, it should default to denial of privileges to users.
If access control subsystems are malfunctioning, the systems should remain unavailable until such time as the problem has been rectified.
Approved 12/14/11 last updated July 22, 2014 NETWORK PROTECTION Page Users must not test or attempt to compromise computer or communication system security measures unless specifically approved in advance and in writing by the IT Infrastructure Services director.
Incidents involving unapproved system hacking, password guessing, file decryption, bootleg software copying, or similar unauthorized attempts to compromise security measures may be unlawful, and will be considered serious violations of Texas Wesleyan policy.
Customer/student requests that Texas Wesleyan security mechanisms be compromised must not be satisfied unless the IT Infrastructure Services director approves in advance or Texas Wesleyan is compelled to comply by law.
Short-cuts bypassing systems security measures, pranks, and practical jokes involving the compromise of systems security measures are absolutely prohibited.
The privileges granted to users, based on their role within the organization, should be reevaluated by administration annually.
In response to feedback from executives, department managers, the Human Resources department, or the IT Infrastructure Services director, system administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no longer needed by users.
Department heads/Directors must report all significant changes in employee duties or employment status promptly to the Information Technology department or system administrators(for non-IT managed systems) responsible for user IDs associated with the involved persons.
For all terminations, the Human Resources department must issue a notice of status change to the Information Technology department and all system administrators who might be responsible for a system on which the involved employee might have a user
ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCESS PATHS Changes to Texas Wesleyan internal networks include loading new software, changing network addresses, reconfiguring routers, and adding remote lines.
With the exception of emergency situations, all changes to Texas Wesleyan computer networks must use the formal change management process and be documented in a work order request.
In addition, the Request for Change(RFC) must be approved in advance by the Information Technology Infrastructure Services Director except as delegated Emergency changes to networks must be made by persons who are authorized by Information Technology.
This process prevents unexpected changes from leading to denial of service, unauthorized disclosure of information, and other problems.
This process applies not only to employees, but also to vendor personnel.
Employees must not establish electronic bulletin boards, local area networks, FTP servers, web servers, modem connections to existing local area networks, illegal Peer-to-Peer sharing or other multi-user systems for communicating information without the specific approval of the IT Infrastructure Services director.
New types of real-time connections between two or more in-house computer systems must not be established unless such approval is obtained.
Participation in external networks as a provider of services that external parties rely on is prohibited unless Texas Wesleyan legal counsel has identified the legal risks involved and the Chief Information Officer has expressly accepted these and other risks associated with the proposal.

Centrally located alongside Connecticut s capital city and midway between Boston and New York City, our 350-acre campus offers big opportunities, from major industry partnerships to vibrant cultural destinations.
Beyond just landing a job after graduation, we empower you to rise quickly in your field.
With more than 100 student clubs and organizations, 17 Division I sports teams, and a support system to help you succeed, you can dabble, experiment, and broaden your passions at UHart.
Students have their own high speed Ethernet connection to the Campus Network and the Internet via 10 base T(twisted pair) jacks in their rooms.
This provides 100 megabit per second(Mbs) twisted-pair Ethernet for each PC or Macintosh connected.
All residence halls are also equipped with wireless connectivity.
A WiFi signal should be available in all areas of your suite or bedroom, and in most laundry rooms and meeting rooms, and some areas outside of the buildings.
Our network is designed to work with both Windows and Macintosh computers.
While the University of Hartford makes no brand preference for students when purchasing a new computer, we do have some guidelines for performance to ensure suitable compatibility with our Ethernet network in the Residences.
Information Technology Services recommends that you use WPA, and only use WEP if your device does not support WPA, or if you do not want your computer or device to permanently store your University password.
Where to get help Need help connecting to the wireless network?
Call the ITS Computer Support Line at 860.768.5999 or bring your computer or device to the Computer Support Center in CC113.
Most computers and devices can permanently store your University username and password so that you don't have to manually log in to the network each time you turn your device on(especially convenient with phones and tablets).
No need to configure your device with a complicated security key.
Some computers or devices may also prompt for one or more of the following: Connection type: Infrastructure Security type: WPA2-Enterprise Encryption type: AES Authentication method: PEAP Note: Some computers and devices may warn you that they cannot verify the authenticity of the network's security certificate.
Windows displays a particularly ominous message!)
How to connect most computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones Most computers and WiFi-capable devices will automatically "see" the network.
Look for and select the network on your computer or device named "hawknet."
You'll need the following settings in order to configure your wireless computer to connect to the University network via WPA: Network name: hawknet Username: Your UofH email name(without the "@hartford.edu" part) Password: Your UofH email password The computer or device will ask for a Username and a Password.
Enter your University of Hartford email name(only -- without the "@hartford.edu" part) and your email password.
If your computer or device displays a message about the network's security certificate, click "Ok" or "Continue" as prompted.
The computer is now connected to the campuswide network, and the Internet.
If you have a game console, or an older computer that does not support WPA-2 Enterprise networks, try connecting to our WEP network."
Connecting via WEP UHDEVICES: Works with more computers and operating systems than WPA.
Your computer or device does not store your University password.
Must start a web browser each time you start up(or resume) your computer or device in order to log on to the network via an authentication web page.
if your computer cannot connect to hawknet) Only use the following directions for devices such as game consoles and older computers.
If it is a device that does not do web authentication, you will need to register the device.
Registering a Game Console or Streaming Player on WiFi You'll need the following settings in order to configure your wireless computer to connect to the University network via WEP.
Some operating systems and/or network card drivers may not ask some of the following.
SSID: uhdevices(must be typed in all lowercase letters!)
Password: Hartfordhawks Look for and select the network on your computer or device named "uhartford."
The computer or device may then ask for a network password, often called a "security key" The University's key for the uhdevices network(which is the same everywhere on campus) is Hartfordhawks.
It's a long password, but easy to remember and type -- notice that it's just Hartford hawks with no space and the first letter capitalized.
Most computers and devices will remember this password forever once you type it in, so you shouldn't need to memorize
Once your network card "associates" itself with the network, start your web browser, if on a device you did not register.
You will automatically be directed to the Network Authentication System where you must enter your University of Hartford email name(only -- without the "@hartford.edu" part), and your email password.
Your web browser will then automatically continue to its usual home page, and your device is now connected to the campus wide network, and the Internet.
You will have to start a web browser and log in each time you turn on your device.
Registering a Game Console or Streaming Player on WiFi Devices, such as game consoles(Playstation, Xbox, W and video streaming players(Apple TV, Roku, Blu-ray players, Smart TVs) are not designed to work in an enterprise-class, high density, authenticated WiFi environment such as that in a University.
These devices are best connected to the University network via a wired connection for best gameplay and best video streaming performance.
Information Technology Services recommends that you connect such devices to the wired network via an Ethernet cable.
However, they can be connected to the University s WiFi network by registering them to use a lower-security(less powerful encryption) that the device can support, and by storing your network credentials for the device in the WiFi system.
Registration is accomplished by entering a unique fingerprint (called a Media Control Access or MAC address) on your device into the WiFi system and associating it with your University network account.
Every networkable device has a unique MAC address.
Follow the Registering a Game Console or Streaming Player on WiFi guide to register your device to the University s WiFi network.
Limitations There are limitations to how you can use the "airspace" on campus and some devices will not work in an authenticated system such as the University's.
You may not operate your own wireless network on campus You must not operate your own wireless network "access point" devices at the University of Hartford.
These devices will interfere with the University's wireless signal and deprive others access to the network.
These are considered "Unauthorized devices" which ".interfere. with the activities of others." under the University's Responsible Technology Use Policy.
Unauthorized devices are referred to as "rogue access points."
An "access point" device is any item that acts as a "wireless infrastructure" device.
Computer Policies These devices include: Wireless routers(such as Linksys, Netgear, Belkin, Apple Airport) Wireless disk drives(such as Maxtor Central Axis, Apple Time Capsule) MiFi "hot spots"(such as offered by Sprint, Verizon) Cell phones operating as "hot spots"(such as Android, iPhone) You may only operate wireless "client" devices on the University campus.
Such devices include laptop and desktop computers with WiFi, smartphones that can connect to WiFi networks, tablets such a Apple iPad, Kindle Fire, and most Androids.
Some devices cannot connect to a WPA-2 Enterprise network such as HawkNet.
You can try connecting them to the University's WEP network as described in "Connecting via WEP."
Why can't I install my own wireless network?
Crowded airspace: To provide a robust and reliable signal to all residents, over 1,000 access points within a small confined area.
To ensure maximum network performance of(speed, signal strength, and reliability), these radios operate on one of three non-overlapping channels(WiFi channels 1, 6, and 11), and are all tuned to maximize signal strength in all locations while not interfering with each other.
When two radios are on the same channel(or within channels of each other) and are too close to each other, their signals interfere with each other, causing connected computers to communicate slowly within a network.
The University network was designed, and is continuously monitored to maintain the maximum performance and reliability possible for the thousands of people using
Introducing a new("rogue") access point into the system damages the balance of the system.
While you might be able to connect to your rogue device, it would "pollute" the airwaves for up to two hundred feet in all directions above, below, and around it, denying others access to the University network.
It continuously monitors the airwaves for "rogue" devices, triangulates their physical locations, and then "attacks" them in an attempt to render them unusable.
University Code of Conduct: Anyone found operating a device acting as an access point will be charged under the University Code of Conduct, as doing so negatively impacts other residents.
Penalties may include housing selection ineligibility.

The use of these Computer Resources is a privilege extended to members of the Belmont community, who are expected to act in a responsible, ethical, and legal manner.
PURPOSE In general, acceptable use entails behavior that respects the rights of others, does not compromise the security or integrity of computer and network resources, and complies with all applicable laws and license agreements.
This policy establishes specific requirements for the use of computing and network resources at Belmont University.
As with other university policies, violation of the Acceptable Use Policy can result in disciplinary action.
SCOPE This policy applies to all users of computer and network resources owned or managed by Belmont University.
Resources include all university owned, licensed, or managed hardware and software, as well as the university network, regardless of the ownership of the device connected to the network, the means of connecting, or the locale from which the connection is made.
Users must comply with all federal, state, and other applicable law; all applicable university rules and procedures; and all applicable licenses and contracts.
Examples include but are not limited to laws pertaining to libel, copyright, trademark, child pornography, and hacking; the Bruin Guide and other codes of conduct; the Employee and Faculty Handbooks; the universities sexual misconduct policy; and all applicable software licenses.
Users may use only those IT resources they are authorized to use, in the manner and to the extent authorized, and they must not attempt to subvert or bypass university-imposed security mechanisms.
Ability to access computers, computer accounts, computer files, or other IT resources does not, by itself, imply authorization to do
Accounts and passwords may not be shared with or used by persons other than those to whom they have been assigned by the university.
Users must make a reasonable effort to protect passwords and secure resources against unauthorized use.
Users must respect the finite capacity of the university s IT resources and limit their use so as not to consume an unreasonable amount of those resources or to interfere unreasonably with the activity of other users.
LITS may set limits on an individual s use of IT resources or require that an individual user refrain from specific uses in order to assure that these resources can be used by anyone who needs them.
Reasonableness of use will be assessed in the context of all relevant circumstances, but any use that degrades the performance of the university network or interferes with the ability of others to use IT resources or with the universities educational or business activities will be considered unacceptable.
Users may not use IT resources to campaign for or against a candidate for political office or for commercial purposes inconsistent with the university s tax-exempt status.
Personal use of university IT resources for other purposes is permitted when it does not interfere with the performance of one s job or other university responsibilities, does not compromise the functionality or degrade the performance of IT resources, does not consume a significant amount of IT resources, and is otherwise in compliance with this policy.
Further limits on personal use by university employees may be imposed in accordance with normal supervisory practices.
Since Belmont University is an educational entity rather than a commercial entity, commercial use of Belmont s computing resources is prohibited.
Users are not permitted to host commercial sites on the university s network or use Belmont s websites or other intellectual property to conduct or promote commercial interests.
Belmont reserves the right to restrict accounts and remove individual web pages that are used for commercial purposes.
Internet users at Belmont are to refrain from displaying or distributing material(text, audio or video) which is obscene, harassing, or is in any way inconsistent with Belmont s Statement of Values.
For purposes of this policy, obscenity is defined as(1) material in which a reasonable person, applying contemporary Belmont community standards, when considering the contents as a whole, would conclude that they appeal to prurient sexual/physical interests or violently subordinating behavior rather than an intellectual or communicative purpose; and(2) material that, when taking its content and particular usage or application as a whole, lacks any redeeming literary, scientific, political, artistic or social value.
Inappropriate Uses of Internet Access There are numerous appropriate uses of the Internet including email, social media, and access to information on the Internet.
Belmont encourages the educational and appropriate use of these resources.
All uses of Internet resources should be consistent with the university s Statement of Values.
Users are to refrain from deliberately performing any act that will impair the operation of any facet of the computing resources of the university or the resources of any recipient of the information.
Those who use computing resources for recreation, entertainment, personal and extracurricular work are to yield to those who have academic or university business-related need for the computer resources.
Examples of non-academic or university business-related use are playing computer games, printing personal or extracurricular materials(invitations, announcements, resumes, etc.)
and or accessing personal social media accounts such as Twitter, Snapchat or Facebook.
PRIVACY AND SECURITY The university takes various measures to protect its information resources and users accounts.
However, you should be aware that the university cannot guarantee privacy and that it is the responsibility of individual users to engage in prudent practices by establishing appropriate access restrictions for their accounts and safeguarding their passwords in accord with the Password Policy.
The normal operation of the university s IT infrastructure requires backing up data, logging activity, monitoring general usage patterns, and other such activities.
While the university does not generally review the content of information contained on a computer or transmitted over the network, exceptions are made under the following conditions: when required to preserve public health and safety; when required to preserve or restore system integrity or security; when required by federal, state, or local law; or when there are reasonable grounds to believe that IT resources are being used in violation of law or university policy.

Communications Systems User Policy The Cabrini University department of Information Technology & Resources is pleased to offer its users access to a variety of electronic communications systems.
Our goal in providing this access to University users is to promote excellence in higher education by facilitating resource sharing, innovation, and communication in support of Cabrini s mission and values.
University users are defined as students, faculty, staff and authorized guests.
Electronic communications systems managed by ITR include email, computer systems, and internet access.
The email and computer systems are the property of Cabrini and subject to acceptable use compliance.
The operation of these systems relies upon the proper conduct of Cabrini users, who must adhere to acceptable-use guidelines.
The use of Cabrini electronic communications systems is a privilege, not a right.
Cabrini reserves the right to deny or cancel communications systems at any time.
All users are expected to use these systems in an appropriate and ethical manner.
Appropriate use includes use for official instructional, educational, professionally-related business and research purposes consistent with Cabrini s mission and values.
These policies and guidelines outline the responsibilities inherent in authorized access, requiring efficient, ethical and legal utilization of system resources.
Wireless Although the FCC doesn t regulate the radio frequencies that the wireless network uses, Cabrini does.
Only by controlling this portion of the radio spectrum can we guarantee a good level of network service and data security.
This page provides information on Cabrini's 2.4 GHz radio spectrum policy.
To ensure a properly working and universally accessible wireless network, Cabrini generally prohibits the use of equipment that interferes with the wireless network.
This means that you may not operate wireless routers, access points or other similar equipment in, on or near Cabrini-owned buildings.
This includes classrooms, laboratories, private offices, and residence halls.
Any network port or device exhibiting behavior from one of these devices will be disabled.
In addition, if a device is found to be causing interference within our network in any way, the network port it is connected to will remain disabled for a period of two weeks for the first offense.
If the wireless device is found to have been reconnected, the network jack will be disabled for the remainder of the semester.
Other equipment that operates in the 2.4 GHz radio spectrum including some cordless phones may also cause problems with the wireless network.
Any device causing such interference will have to be turned off.
Cabrini assumes no responsibility to compensate you for any direct or incidental costs related to requiring that the use of the interfering equipment be terminated on University owned or managed property.
Requesting Exceptions to this Policy Specific temporary exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Office of Information Technology & Resources(ITR) to address needs in areas that are not adaquately served by the University-provided wireless network or for other reasons deemed appropriate by ITR.
Requests for temporary exceptions to the 2.4 GHz Airspace Policy must be addressed in writing(email is acceptable) to itrhelp@cabrin edu and must explain which kind of equipment would be operated, the location where it would be operated, the reason for its use, and the time period for which the exception is requested.
Requests will be considered, but there is no guarantee of approval.
All decisions about airspace policy exceptions are made by the Office of Information Technology & Resources Networking/Systems group.

The Irvin E. Houck Center for Information Technology(CIT) provides and maintains the Help Desk, campus network, administrative systems, web servers and other servers, general and departmental computer labs and facilities, and institutionally owned desktop and laptop computers.
CIT also provides audiovisual and educational technology support and resources.
The facilities of CIT are an essential resource for academic, administrative, and research processes for members of the college community.
As such, all members of the college community are encouraged to use these resources, provided they respect the rights of others, abide by the rules and regulations of the college, and assume shared responsibility for safeguarding the colleges computing environment.
Proper and fair use is essential if all are to derive maximum benefit from them.
This policy may be modified at any time.
Use of CIT resources is considered an agreement to abide by this policy.
Users found in violation may be subject to penalties of varying degree, including temporary or permanent denial of access to CIT resources and services.
Violators may also be subject to action by college, civil, or criminal judicial systems.
Guiding Principles In making information technology resources available to all members of the college community, Oberlin College affirms its commitment to a free and open educational environment, conducive to learning and governed by legal and ethical principles.
Oberlin College values the free flow of information.
The college respects individual privacy, civility, and intellectual property rights.
Because an electronic environment is easily disrupted and electronic information is readily copied, users of the colleges resources are honor-bound to promote and protect these institutional values.
Under normal circumstances, college officials will not examine personal information transmitted over the network or stored on college-owned computers.
However, the college reserves the right to monitor system resources, including activity and accounts, with or without notice, when:
It is necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of college computing resources.

An account or system is engaged in unusual or excessive activity.

It has good cause to believe that regulations, rules, or laws are being violated.

In the event of health, safety, or security emergencies, as determined by authorized college officials.

When, due to the extended absence of an employee, demise of an employee, or termination of an employee for cause, as verified by the Chief Human Resources Officer or other authorized college official, it is necessary to retrieve vital college-related material.

Additionally, the normal operation and maintenance of the colleges computing resources requires the backup of data, the logging of activity, the monitoring of general usage patterns, and other such activities as may be necessary in order to provide desired services.
Accordingly, all Oberlin College personnel are strongly urged to use college-provided resources only for college-related material and to acquire and use personal accounts and devices for any non-work-related material.
Note that any access made to an individuals account or data will be no more extensive than necessary.
The account holder/data owner will generally be notified of access, either prior to or after access has occurred, when such notification will not be deleterious to pending or potential legal or security considerations.
User Responsibilities Access to computing resources and network capacity is a privilege to which all college faculty, staff, and students are entitled.
Access may be granted to other individuals affiliated with the college or college personnel, as situations warrant and with approval from the director of information technology.)
Certain responsibilities correspond with that privilege, including those listed below.
Since no list can cover all possible circumstances, the spirit of this policy must be respected, namely; any action that hinders legitimate computer usage or invades the privacy of another person or institution is unacceptable.

All facilities of the Center for Information Technology, including those located in remote sites, are for the use of Oberlin College students, faculty, and staff.
Spouses, partners, and children of members of these groups, with qualified needs, may apply to the Chief Information Technology Officer for the privilege of using CIT facilities.
Residents of Oberlin, Lorain County, or others who have been granted library privileges are not automatically permitted to use CIT facilities.

Users must not abuse equipment and are asked to report any mistreatment or vandalism of computing or network facilities to CIT staff(Mudd Level A) or to Campus Safety at(440) 775-8444.
Food is discouraged in all CIT computer facilities, including remote sites operated by the CIT, because of potential harm to equipment.
Beverages in approved containers(sturdy, covered, reusable containers) are allowed.
Users should relinquish the computer they are using if they are doing nonessential work when others are waiting for a computer to perform course-related activities.
Equipment should not be monopolized.
Users should not use more than one computer at a time and should plan work so that the computer session is no longer than absolutely necessary.
Game playing in CIT-maintained computer facilities/labs is prohibited at all times.
Users should not install software, alter system files, or disconnect any cables on computers or other equipment.
Users are expected to respect other users and the staff of the Center for Information Technology.
Verbal or physical abuse of others, student or staff, will not be tolerated.
A user must show an Oberlin College ID card to any CIT staff member or CIT student employee who so requests.
Users must respect all notices(such as those concerning hours of operation, printing, etc.)
posted in CIT facilities.
Computers assigned to faculty and staff for the duration of their employment at Oberlin College remain the property of Oberlin College and as such, should be treated with appropriate care.
These computers may be upgraded, as warranted, and must be relinquished in order for any required maintenance to be performed.
Note that termination of employment may result in the immediate inability to access ones assigned computer.
Accordingly, users are encouraged to use personally-owned computers to store or process personal materials.

Information technology resources may not be used for illegal or harmful purposes, including:
intentional harassment of others;

intentional destruction or damage to equipment, software, or data;
intentional disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.

Software is normally distributed under three kinds of licenses: proprietary, public distribution, and shareware.
Unless otherwise indicated, users should assume all software made available by CIT is proprietary and may not be legally copied.
CIT will not knowingly provide support for software that a user possesses in violation of its license agreement.
Consultants and staff may ask for proof of ownership before helping users with their software.
CIT will not knowingly allow illegally acquired software to be used on Oberlin-owned computers.
CIT will remove any suspect software loaded onto Oberlin College-owned computers or servers.
CIT will not knowingly allow use of its resources(computers, equipment, network, etc.)
for the illegal copying of digital media or files.
Copyright Law protects copyright owners from the unauthorized reproduction, adaptation, or distribution of digital material, including the unauthorized use of copyrighted sound recordings(e.g., music files), video files, and interactive digital software( e., video games).

Users should not use information technology resources, including personally-owned computers connected to the college network, for non-college, unsanctioned, or commercial activity.

Users should make no attempt to alter the condition or status of any computing network component in any manner.
Users should make no attempt to alter software other than their own, or to copy software intended only for execution.
Users should not interfere with, interrupt, or obstruct the ability of others to use the network or other CIT resources.
Users should not attempt to connect to a host via the network without explicit permission of the owner.
Users should not provide, assist in, or gain unauthorized access to college computing or network resources.
Users should not attempt to circumvent or defeat computer or network security measures.
Users should not systematically collect and use any privately or publicly available college data or content, including users personal directory and account information, through the use of data mining, robots, or similar gathering and extraction methods.

Security
The college uses various measures to ensure the security of its computing resources.
Users should be aware that the college cannot guarantee such security and should apply appropriate safeguards for their accounts, such as guarding their passwords and changing passwords regularly(required for e-mail accounts), and logging out of computers when done.

Users should be aware that data stored and used within OCApps(online applications powered by Google) is inherently non-secure, and is also not backed
Thus, users must not place any confidential, sensitive, or personal data within any of the OCApps, and should not use OCApps as a primary storage location for vital data(alternative storage media should also be used).
Systems administrators of other departmental and individual computer systems are responsible for the security of information stored on those systems and for keeping those systems free from unauthorized access.
The default protection setting on CIT servers defines all files as belonging exclusively to their owner.
Unless the owner changes the protection level, no file may be read, executed, or modified by users other than the owner.
The only exception to this understanding is
that designated members of the CIT staff may examine accounts or files of users to investigate security problems, possible abuse of the Oberlin College computing system, or violations of regulations.

Account holders should use only their own personal accounts unless given permission by an authorized member of the faculty, administration, or professional staff to use one that is designated for a specific purpose or job.
Account holders may not allow others to use their personal accounts.
The person holding an account is responsible for its use, and all activity originating from that account, at all times.

Account holders should choose strong passwords, protect their passwords and keep them confidential.
Passwords should be changed frequently.
Any problem resulting from irresponsible use of a password(e.g., a password that can be easily guessed or oral or written dissemination of a password) may be treated as grounds for action against the account holder.
Any attempt to determine the passwords of other users is strictly prohibited.
Account holders should not abuse any electronic mail, bulletin board, or communications system, either local or remote, by sending rude, obscene, or harassing messages(including chain letters) or by using these systems for non-essential purposes during the times when the computers are in heavy demand.
Account holders should identify themselves clearly and accurately in all electronic communications, e., no anonymous postings and no spoofing of addresses.
Unofficial mass e-mailings( e., spam) are prohibited.
Account holders should use only their own files, those that have been designated as public, or those that have been made available to them with the knowledge and consent of the owner.
Individual Oberlin College accounts(@oberlin.edu mail accounts, web accounts, etc.)
are created for the express use of the individual for whom the accounts are created, but remain the property of Oberlin College.
Accounts may be viewed in circumstances such as those delineated in paragraph B. above.
Faculty and staff accounts may also be accessed to recover work-related information in the event of the termination of employment, or the incapacitation or demise of the employee.
Accordingly, faculty and staff account holders are strongly urged to use a non-Oberlin account for personal correspondence.

Network Usage The following are responsibilities that are particularly applicable to users of Oberlins campus-wide network.

Only computers that have been properly virus checked, updated, and authenticated through established procedures may be connected to the campus network, unless otherwise authorized and established by CIT.
Users must not attempt to circumvent this process.

The person recognized as the owner of that authenticated computer system is responsible for that computers use, and all activity originating from that computer, at all times.
Excessive or improper use of network resources that inhibits or interferes with use by others is prohibited and will be cause for action by CIT, which may include restricting, limiting, or disabling network access.
Users who connect computers to the network that act as servers have the additional responsibility to respond to any use of their server that is found to be in violation of this Policy.
In no case shall the following types of servers be connected to the network: DNS, DHCP, BOOTP, or any other server that manages network addresses.
f. Due to the serious negative impact on network availability created by misconfigured routers and Wireless Access Points(WAPs), all routers and WAPS, except those configured and used by CIT, or devices which function as routers or WAPs, are disallowed.

Enforcement Violations of this policy will be adjudicated, as deemed appropriate, and may include the following:
Loss of computing privileges b. Disconnection from the network c. Oberlin College Student Conduct action d. Prosecution under applicable civil or criminal laws Because of the rapid changes in technology, it is impossible to enumerate all of the circumstances that would constitute a violation of this Acceptable Use Policy.
Additional circumstances that violate the spirit of the policy may be subject to the above penalties.
Computer users should view the Center for Information Technology website for any updates to these policies(new.oberlin.edu/office/cit/).
Additional pertinent information and details may also be found there.

Copyright Copyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act(Title 17 of the United States Code).
These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work.
In the file-sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement.
Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties.
In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or "statutory" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed.
For "willful" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed.
A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees.
See also Hofstra's policy regarding Reporting Copyright Infringements for more information about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and penalties thereunder.
Peer-to-peer(P2P) file-sharing technology allows users to make files available for other users to download and use.
File sharers store files on their computers and the file-sharing software enables other users to download the files onto their computers.
Examples of P2P file sharing networks include BitTorrent, Gnutella, and LimeWire, among others.
Even if you do not intend to engage in infringing activity, installing P2P software on a computer can easily result in you unintentionally sharing files(copyrighted music or even sensitive documents) with other P2P users, and you may then be personally responsible for the legal and financial consequences.
Moreover, any file sharing and file scanning software(e.g., P2P software) creates significant risks of compromise to your computer and your privacy, as well as to other computers on the HOFSTRA NETWORK.
There is no way to tell what malicious functions may be performed by the software automatically downloaded or what modifications may have been made to the files themselves.
Distributing copyrighted works without permission of the copyright holder is both contrary to Hofstra's policy on appropriate-use, and is a violation of federal law governing copyright.
If you are serving any data, in any medium, that is not your own intellectual property, and is protected by copyright, you must either obtain the permission of the owner of the material or remove the copyrighted material from distribution immediately.
Please note that FTP or web servers for the intention of distributing copyrighted or pirated software on the HOFSTRA NETWORK or the internet are illegal and not permitted on the HOFSTRA NETWORK.
Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.

Network Account Specific Policies and Information Network accounts are intended to provide members of the Hofstra University community with basic access to Hofstra University Network academic and administrative software applications and internet services, including electronic mail, Google Applications, the my.hofstra.edu portal, and other information services via World Wide Web.
Users agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the services, servers or networks provided.
Password Each user of the system is assigned a unique login
The system automatically prompts users to change their passwords every six months to maintain high security on the system.
It is the account holders' responsibility to maintain the secrecy of their passwords.
Passwords must conform to Hofstra University's strong password policy.
Limitations of the Hofstra Network Account To provide the best possible service to the large community of Hofstra University Network users, the following limitations have been placed on the configuration and use of each Hofstra Network account: Network accounts are intended solely for the account holder's access to resources on the Hofstra University Network and related services.
Users of the network must therefore agree that, under no circumstance, will they allow other individuals to access these resources via their accounts.
Furthermore, you will not provide to others Hofstra University Network access to information services via your computer system.
For students, network accounts will be deactivated and removed upon graduation, or if affiliation with Hofstra University ends.
For employees, access to the employee network and email accounts will be revoked upon termination.
A residential student's wired Hofstra Network connection is to be used only by the individuals residing in the room where the port is located.
Under no circumstance may students allow other individuals to access the HOFSTRA NETWORK through the wired network connection in their rooms.
Users are not to run any type of unauthorized server( e., web/HTTP servers, file servers, DNS servers, DHCP servers, FTP servers, list servers, media sharing server, etc.)
via this HOFSTRA NETWORK connection.
This connection is not for commercial use(including, but not limited to nonprofit services that are not University sponsored).
Users may not use wireless routers or Wi-Fi access points on the Hofstra University campus as these devices interfere with Hofstra-provided wireless network services and potentially allow unauthorized access to Hofstra's network.
Software that uses SNMP or ICMP to automatically discover or identify entities on a network is prohibited.
Only IT may run any type of network analysis or network scanning equipment or software on the HOFSTRA NETWORK at large.
Such devices can be used to manipulate the network, impact connectivity at large, and damage individual machines.
Any such activity detected on the HOFSTRA NETWORK will be considered a security breach warranting investigation and possible revocation of network privileges during the investigation.
Only IT may run redundant BOOTP, DHCP and DNS servers on behalf of the HOFSTRA NETWORK.
Individual departments may not run such servers of their own.
IT sets the standards for all network services in DNS services and servers.
IT runs an HTTP proxy server on behalf of the University and no other HTTP proxy servers may be run on the network.
Restrictions on use of Bandwidth In order to ensure that the Hofstra network availability is sufficient for academic work and Hofstra business, the University has taken steps to restrict traffic related to unauthorized outside services that enable distribution of music files, streaming video, or audio over the internet.
High-bandwidth projects or activities, including streaming video and videoconferencing, should also be conducted in coordination with
Electronic Mail Faculty, Administrators, and Staff Hofstra provides email services for legitimate University-related activities and personal use should remain incidental.
University email accounts, as Computing Resources, are subject to the provisions of this Acceptable Use Policy.
As with all Computing Resources, email accounts are not completely private, and users should have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their use of email services.
Access to Accounts of Terminated or Otherwise Unavailable Employees It is not a standard practice to provide access to the email accounts of former or otherwise unavailable employees.
In general, and subject to the provisions of this Acceptable Use Policy, access to employee email accounts should be with employee's consent.
When employees are not available to provide such consent, for example, when an employee is on leave; unexpectedly goes on a prolonged absence; is terminated for cause; or is otherwise incapacitated; no access will be granted to their email accounts without the prior written approval of the Chief Human Resources Officer or her designee for nonfaculty employees and, for faculty, of the Provost or her designee.
Any requests for access directed to the ITS Service Desk will be redirected to the Human Resources department or Provost's Office, as appropriate.
Deceased Employees University email accounts are for legitimate University-related activities and are digital assets belonging to the University and not to the employees.
Upon notice of an employee's death, the University's IT department will coordinate with the Human Resources department to disable the deceased employee's network account, including email accounts.
No direct access to the University email accounts of deceased employees will be provided to third parties.
Timely requests for access to email accounts of deceased employees by the employees' former department for University business shall be subject to the same approval process set forth above.
Student Email Hofstra University students are provided with a Hofstra Gmail account sponsored by Google.
While a student at Hofstra, student use of the Hofstra Gmail account is subject to this Acceptable Use Policy.
The Hofstra Gmail account will remain with the student once the student has graduated or is no longer a Hofstra student and is then subject to the terms and conditions set forth by Google.
Upon a student's death, the University's IT department disables a student's University Google/Gmail account and deletes the account and its contents 30 days later.
Any rights to the deceased student's University Gmail account are subject to this limited retention, to the terms and conditions of the Google account, and to applicable law.
No Warranties or Assurances The University makes no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, with respect to the Computing Resources it provides.
Hofstra University is not responsible for any damage resulting from use of Computing Resources, including service interruptions, loss of data or damage to hardware or software on your personal systems at home, in the residence halls or public access computer labs on campus.
Hempstead, N.Y. 11549-1000(516) 463-6600 Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube Flickr Hofstra University is an EO/AA/ADA educator and employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin, or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, physical or mental disability, marital or veteran status in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.
Hofstra University admits students of any race, color, national, and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded or made available to its students.
Purpose The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information assets owned by Ithaca College.
Ithaca College provides computer devices, networks, and other electronic information systems to meet its mission, goals, and objectives.
Ithaca College grants access to these resources confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets.
This policy specifies the conditions that wireless infrastructure devices must satisfy in order to connect to the Ithaca College network.
Only those wireless infrastructure devices that meet the standards specified in this policy or are granted an exception by Information Technology Services are approved for connection to the Ithaca College network.

Scope This policy addresses the requirements of Wireless deployments, Wireless usage, and Wireless airspace usage.
All employees, students, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and others who use the Ithaca College network, including all personnel affiliated with third parties that maintain a wireless infrastructure device on behalf of Ithaca College, must adhere to this policy.
This policy applies to all wireless infrastructure devices that connect to the Ithaca College network or reside at an Ithaca College owned, leased or rented site that provide wireless connectivity to endpoint devices including, but not limited to, laptops, desktops, cellular phones, and personal digital assistants(PDAs).
This includes any form of wireless communication device capable of transmitting packet data.

Policy Wireless Deployments Standards supported: IEEE 802.11n is the preferred wireless networking standard.
g, 802.11b, and 802.11a will be available, where necessary.
IEEE 802.1X is the authentication standard.
Additional security procedures may be applied as needed.
WPA2 with AES encryption will be the only secure standard used.
Service Set Identifier(SSID) There shall be two SSIDs broadcast by the wireless deployment.
ICAirnet For visitor Internet access and access to installation instructions and tools needed to access ICAirnet-Secure(see below).
ICAirnet-Secure For roles-based access to the network.
Only devices authenticated via Ithaca College account credentials may access this SSID.
Wireless Service Considerations: Wireless networking has bandwidth limitations compared to the wired network.
The wireless network should be viewed as augmenting the wired network, to provide more flexible network use.
Applications that require large amounts of bandwidth, or are sensitive to changes in signal quality and strength may not be appropriate for wireless access.
Wireless technology is and will for the foreseeable future be a shared bandwidth technology.
Some protocols and services will not effectively work in, or may be inappropriate for, a wireless environment.
Wireless IP Addresses DHCP is the standard addressing method for the IC wireless networks, and is expected to meet the majority of customer requirements.
Wireless is a dynamic service.
Due to the dynamic nature of wireless, IP space serving the campus will change over time due to capacity re-engineering.
Restrictions Ithaca College policy requires that all deployments of wireless infrastructure be installed and maintained by ITS.
Installing departmental or do-it-yourself wireless access points is prohibited to avoid possible interference with the IC wireless network, unnecessary impact to the wired network and to minimize undue security risks to the College.
Additionally, in areas where centrally-managed wireless networking is available any pre-existing locally managed access points must be removed.
Use of the wireless network is subject to the established policies for use of IC campus network services.
e.g.
All College Computer and Network Use Policy) Only devices authenticated via Ithaca College account credentials may access network resources on the IC network that are not Internet facing.
Unauthenticated visitors will be able to access only the Internet by accepting the policy restrictions on usage and providing their email address.
All data transactions shall be encrypted and secured by the protocols listed in the Supported Standards section above.
Services allowed through the wireless network should be substantially identical to those for wired access.
Role based users will be limited to those same services they are permitted to access via wired network controls.
Visitors shall have free access to the Internet only.
They shall be limited to only those TCP/IP protocols listed in Table
In general, standard Web access, Secure Shell access, Instant Messenger access, email access, sending email via secure methods, and Remote VPN access are permitted by these protocols.
Wireless Airspace To provide wireless access, the radio frequency airspace of the campus serves as the transport medium for this technology.
Wireless networks operate on the campus shared and finite airspace spectrum.
Therefore, Information Technology Services(ITS) will regulate and manage this airspace centrally to ensure its fair and efficient allocation and to prevent collision, interference, unauthorized intrusion and failure.
In addition, central management will facilitate the adoption of new features.
Persons using wireless devices to connect to the College network must be aware of this, and comply with this policy and any other related policies.
ITS will approach the shared use of the wireless radio frequencies in the same way that it manages the shared use of the wired network.
Specific issues pertaining to wireless network devices are outlined below:
All access points will be installed and configured in such a way as to comply with all security features of the wireless network, including restrictions to provide connections only to those users who are entitled to access.
The College reserves the right to remove, disconnect or electronically limit any access point not installed and configured by ITS personnel or specifically covered by prior written agreement and/or arrangement with ITS.
Other devices such as portable phones, and wireless devices using "Bluetooth"(a competing wireless technology), that broadcast and receive information on the same frequency as wireless Ethernet devices may cause interference with wireless network operation.
If disruptions in wireless service are reported, ITS will investigate and can remove any devices it deems, in its sole discretion, to be interfering with proper network operation.
Only users affiliated with Ithaca College are authorized to use wireless networking on campus.
To help protect these affiliated users from unauthorized access to their computer resources, ITS may implement data encryption and authentication security measures that must be followed by all users.
These measures require the use of specific wireless LAN product types and are designed to meet emerging wireless encryption and security standards.

Continuation pages Network Reliability and Interference In a wireless environment, network reliability is a function both of the level of user congestion(traffic loads) and service availability(interference and coverage).
In an effort to provide an acceptable level of reliability, this policy establishes a method for resolving conflicts that may arise from the use of the wireless spectrum.
Wireless networking technology uses unlicensed frequency bands to create small local area network cells.
Since unrelated devices such as cordless telephones, wireless audio speakers, and even microwave ovens may also use these same frequency bands, the potential for disruption of service exists when multiple devices are placed in close proximity to one another.
While OIT does not actively monitor use of the frequency spectrum for potential interfering devices, it responds to reports of specific devices that are suspected of causing interference and disruption of the campus network.
Where interference between the campus network and other devices cannot be resolved, OIT reserves the right to restrict the use of all wireless devices in University-owned buildings and all outdoor spaces.
Interference or disruption of other authorized communications that result from the intentional or incidental misuse or misapplication of wireless network radio frequency spectrum is prohibited.
In the event that a wireless device interferes with other equipment, OIT will work with the affected departments to resolve the interference.
The Office of Information Technology is responsible for: Creating, maintaining and updating wireless plans, wireless policy and wireless security standards Maintaining a registration of all wireless access points on campus Resolving wireless communication interference problems Managing and deploying wireless communications systems Approving wireless communication hardware, software and installation services used by University schools/departments Informing wireless users of security and privacy policies and procedures related to the use of wireless communications in common areas Providing assistance to the campus community for the development, management and deployment of wireless networks Monitoring performance and security of all wireless networks and maintaining network statistics as required for preventing unauthorized access to the campus network
Monitoring the development of wireless network technologies, evaluating wireless network technology enhancements and, as appropriate, incorporating new wireless network technologies within the University network infrastructure The campus community, including Colleges, divisions and/or departments are responsible for: Adhering to Wireless Network Policy Informing wireless users of security and privacy policies and procedures related to the use of wireless communications Security Awareness: Instructional materials will be made available to all wireless users via the University web site.
The instructional material will include, but not be limited to the following topics: Authentication for wireless network access and protection of passwords Authorized use of wireless network technology Wireless interference issues Procedures for reporting wireless network service problems Procedures for responding to a suspected privacy or security violation Procedures for revoking user accounts due to termination of an affiliation with the University Monitoring and Reporting: The use of wireless network technology is to be monitored by the OIT on a regular basis for security and performance.
Any unusual wireless network event that may reflect unauthorized use of wireless network services should be immediately reported through the OIT for review and, if appropriate, investigation.
Such reportable events include the discovery of unauthorized Wireless Access Points on any MSU properties.
POLICY Responsibility for Wireless Access Points: Campus responsibility for electronic communication resources reside with the Office of Information Technology, who must approve all installations of wireless access points used on all campus sites.
Wireless services are subject to the same rules and policies that govern other electronic communications services at the University.
Abuse or interference with other activities is a violation of acceptable use.
Interference or disruption of other authorized communications or unauthorized interception of other traffic is a violation of policy.
Radio communication, due to its dependence on a scarce and shared resource, is subject to additional rules concerning interference and shared use.

Wireless access points must meet all applicable rules of regulatory agencies, such as, the Federal Communications Commission and Public Utilities Commission.

Wireless access points must be installed so as to minimize interference with other RF activities particularly as described below.
Only hardware and software approved by the Office of Information Technology or designee shall be used for wireless access points.
Security: General access to the network infrastructure, including wireless infrastructure, is limited to individuals authorized to use campus and Internet resources.
Physical security of wireless access points is maintained to protect the access point from theft or access to the data port.
Access points shall enforce user authentication at the access point before granting access to secured campus or Internet services.
Wireless network interfaces shall support authentication to access the secured campus wireless network.
Network Reliability and Interference In a wireless environment, network reliability is a function both of the level of user congestion(traffic loads) and service availability(interference and coverage).
In an effort to provide an acceptable level of reliability, this policy establishes a method for resolving conflicts that may arise from the use of the wireless spectrum.
Wireless networking technology uses unlicensed frequency bands to create small local area network cells.
Since unrelated devices such as cordless telephones, wireless audio speakers, and even microwave ovens may also use these same frequency bands, the potential for disruption of service exists when multiple devices are placed in close proximity to one another.
While OIT does not actively monitor use of the frequency spectrum for potential interfering devices, it responds to reports of specific devices that are suspected of causing interference and disruption of the campus network.
Where interference between the campus network and other devices cannot be resolved, OIT reserves the right to restrict the use of all wireless devices in University-owned buildings and all outdoor spaces.
Interference or disruption of other authorized communications that result from the intentional or incidental misuse or misapplication of wireless network radio frequency spectrum is prohibited.
In the event that a wireless device interferes with other equipment, the OIT or designee shall resolve the interference as determined by use priority.
If other equipment interferes with a wireless device, the OIT or designee shall resolve the interference as determined by use priority.

A wireless network allows those without access to wired network ports access to online resources such as the Internet as well as the campus network.
It does so using the 802.11b or 802.11g wireless network standard which allows communication between a device such as a laptop or smartphone and a wireless access point connected to the campus network.
What constitutes acceptable use of the wireless network?
See the UGA Policies on Use of Computers on the University Network at https://infosec.uga.edu/policies/aup.php.
Although you may be on your laptop you are still using the University network.
This means that you are bound by the acceptable use guidelines mentioned in the above link.
Where is the wireless network available?
Wireless access is available through the Law School's classrooms, common areas, and surrounding grounds.
How do I configure my wireless card to use the wireless network?
Most wireless cards will automatically detect the "PAWS Secure" wireless network.
If your card must be set manually you should set your SSID to "PAWS Secure".
If you are having trouble accessing the network, you can call or visit our help desk in the Law Library Annex(706-542-0895) or contact the UGA help desk directly(706-542-3106) How do I print to law library printers from my laptop?

See the Solutions Center for easy and safe ways to properly send sensitive files/data.
Privacy and Property The campus network is maintained and provided to assist in the pursuit of the mission of Colorado College and to conduct the College's day-to-day operational activities.
The network is College property thus all data composed and created by employees and transmitted and/or stored on the network, is and will remain College property, not the private property of any individual.
Colorado College will make every reasonable effort to respect a user's privacy.
Users should have no expectation of privacy for communications, documents, or other data transmitted or stored on the organization s resources.
In addition, in response to a judicial order or any other action required by law or permitted by official Colorado College policy or as otherwise considered reasonably necessary to protect or promote the legitimate interests of the organization, the College reserves the right to access, review, intercept, monitor, and/or disclose all data created, transmitted, accessed, and/or stored on the College s network and/or technology.
Examples of situations where the exercise of this authority would be warranted include, but are not limited to, the investigation of violations of law or the organization s rules, regulations, or policy, or when access is considered necessary to conduct Colorado College business due to the unexpected absence of an employee or to respond to health or safety emergencies.
Any personal or college-owned data created, transmitted, accessed, and/or stored on the campus network by users on personally-owned devices is subject to the same policies, procedures, guidelines and constraints as data created, transmitted, accessed, and/or stored through the use of College-owned devices.
Exceptions to the data ownership clause described includes: student works developed as a part of their academic or co-curricular pursuits; and scholarly work by faculty and staff such as articles, books, music composition, research data, and the like.
Violation of Privacy Respect the privacy of other users.
Information, data files, external devices, email, and programs owned by individual people are considered private, whether or not the information is accessible by others.
Access to private, financial, or personally identifiable information is restricted to authorized users, even in the case when users are accidentally granted permissions to files or folders they should not see.
Tampering with email, interfering with or intercepting its delivery, and using email for criminal purposes may be felony offenses.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act places electronic mail in the same category as messages delivered by the US Postal Service.
Appropriate Connection Methods Devices may only be connected to the college s network at appropriate connectivity points via authorized methods.

Users should consult ITS if they discover a need to modify or extend the network.
Network Registration Those using the college s network may be required to authenticate when connecting a device.
ITS maintains a database containing machine identification, network addresses, and ownership information.
This data is used to contact the registered users of the equipment in the event their devices are compromised.
Protection of the Network ITS uses multiple methods to protect the college s network.
These include monitoring for external attacks, scanning the network for anomalies, and proactively blocking harmful traffic.
There may be times where more extensive procedures are required to address potential security exposures or to contain actual security exposures.
By connecting to the college s network, users acknowledge that network traffic to and from their devices may be scanned.
By connecting to the college s network, users acknowledge that if a device exhibits behaviors that ITS believes to be a risk, the device will be removed from the network.
Suspicious device behaviors include(1) using substantial network resources,(2) sending disruptive network traffic, or(3) exhibiting a pattern associated with scans or attacks.

Mount St. Mary s University computing and network resources are to be used only for University-related research, instruction, learning, enrichment, dissemination of scholarly information, and administrative activities.
The computing and network facilities of the University are limited and should be used wisely and carefully with consideration for the needs of others.
Computers and network systems offer powerful tools for communications among members of the community and of communities outside the University.
When used appropriately, these tools can enhance dialog and communications.
When used unlawfully or inappropriately, however, these tools can infringe on the work, rights or beliefs of others.
Responsibilities The following are some examples of the responsibilities that accompany computer use at Mount St. Mary s and/or on networks to which Mount St. Mary s is connected.

Users are responsible for all use of their computer account(s).
They should make appropriate use of the system and network-provided protection features and take precautions against others obtaining access to their computer resources.

Users may use only their own computer accounts.
Users may not supply false or misleading information nor improperly obtain another's password in order to gain access to computers or network systems or data.
The negligence or naivet of another user in revealing an account name or password is not considered authorized use.

Users may not attempt to modify the University system or network facilities or attempt to crash systems.
They should not tamper with any software protections or restrictions placed on computer applications or files.
Users may not intercept network traffic without authorization.

Users may not encroach on others' use of computer resources.
Such activities would include, but are not limited to, tying up computer resources for excessive game playing or other trivial applications; sending harassing messages; sending frivolous or excessive messages, including chain letters, junk mail, and other types of broadcast messages, either locally or over the Internet; using excessive amounts of storage; intentionally introducing any computer viruses; physically damaging systems; or running grossly inefficient programs when efficient ones are available.

Users must remember that information distributed through the University's computing and networking facilities is a form of publishing, and some of the same standards apply.
For example, anything generated at MSMU that is available on the Internet may be seen as representing MSMU and not just an individual.
Even with disclaimers, the University is represented by its students, faculty and staff, and appropriate language, behavior and style is warranted.
If an individual misuses computer resources, then the appropriate procedures that exist in University student, faculty, and staff policy handbooks will apply.
Penalties may include the loss of all computer use privileges.

Users are prohibited from installing or using network devices that are not owned by MSMU.
This includes personal wireless access points, servers, hubs, switches, or any other networking equipment.
Disclaimer The University cannot protect individuals against the existence or receipt of text or images that may be offensive to them.
As such, those who make use of electronic communications are warned that they may come across or be recipients of material they find offensive.
Those who make information about themselves available on the Internet(through e-mail or some other means) should be forewarned that the University cannot protect them from invasions of privacy and other possible dangers that could result from the individual's distribution of personal information.
Finally, while the University provides computer resources in its buildings and on its campuses this should not be interpreted as the University sanctioning the materials developed or propagated by the individuals using those resources.
General Security Principles Users are expected to be aware of the security policies of the computers and networks which they access and to adhere to these policies.
Users are individually accountable for their own actions and for all use of the resources assigned to them.

A weakness in the security of any particular system or network is not a license to penetrate or abuse that system or network.
The exploitation of software weaknesses to assume a false identity is not allowed.
The unauthorized use of a computer or network is a violation of both our own campus computing policies and also Internet rules of conduct.
Users have the responsibility to employ the security mechanisms and procedures which have been made available to them in order to protect their own data as well as the systems and network they use.
For systems which rely on password protection this means selecting good passwords, not sharing passwords, and changing passwords immediately upon suspicion that they have been compromised.
Password Security Guidelines Do not set your password equal to your Username or any variation of your Username.
Do not use a password consisting of all the same letter.
Avoid passwords that would be easy to guess.
Do not use your initials or first, middle, or last name or the name of any family member.
Do not use as a password any information easily obtained about yourself such as license number, telephone number, address, social security number, etc.
Do not write your password down; memorize it instead.
Never store your password in a file or document on the computer or send it in a Mail message.
Do not tell anyone your password and do not let other people use your account.

E-mail Brevard College provides an email accounts and is an official means of communication for the College.
In recognition that certain communications may be time-critical, each member of the Brevard College community is expected to check their official email address on a frequent and consistent basis in order to stay current with college and course communications.
E-mail(electronic mail) is designed for direct communications between specific individuals or specified groups.
It may also be used for communication to a wider general audience when appropriate.
The Campus Network and E-Mail system is not to be used for "junk mail"(unsolicited mail that is of little interest or use to the majority of users receiving it) personal announcements, advertisements or other promotions.
E-mail is considered a formal written record that carries the same legal weight as a formal memorandum.
Users of e-mail should remember that e-mail messages become the possession of the receiver and can be easily duplicated and redistributed by recipients.
College policy prohibits certain types of e-mail, including mail that may be perceived as harassment, political campaigning or commercial solicitation.
Chain mail is also prohibited.
Use of a Brevard College email address is to be limited to college business only.
Faculty, staff and students are assigned a quota of space for storage of their e-mail.
The e-mail server will automatically notify you when you are getting close to your storage quota.
When an account reaches or surpasses the quota limit, the user account will not be able to send or receive e-mail until stored messages are deleted.
Mass e-mail Mass E-mail at Brevard College is defined as an E-mail message sent to all members of one or more of the three principal groups on campus: BC Faculty, BC Staff, or BC Students.
In recent years, both the number of messages and the size of individual E-mail messages sent to large groups on campus have grown tremendously, which collectively have the effect of putting undue stress on our E-mail server and quickly filling users E-mail inboxes, requiring users to spend more time removing messages to be able to send new messages.
The large number of mass E-mails sent also makes it more difficult for users to discern messages of genuine necessity or urgency to the entire campus from those of lesser or more marginal interest to smaller groups of faculty, staff, or students.
In order to cut down on both the size and frequency of mass E-mail, all users on campus should take note of the following policies concerning mass E-mail: Mass E-mail sent by a faculty or staff member to all faculty(BC Faculty) and/or staff(BC Staff) as part of the business or academic mission of the College does not require prior approval, but it must adhere to all other standards pertaining to mass E-mail.
Mass E-mail is generally limited to one of the following types of information and must be approved and sent by an office or person responsible for that kind of information.

The Irvin E. Houck Center for Information Technology(CIT) provides and maintains the Help Desk, campus network, administrative systems, web servers and other servers, general and departmental computer labs and facilities, and institutionally owned desktop and laptop computers.
CIT also provides audiovisual and educational technology support and resources.
The facilities of CIT are an essential resource for academic, administrative, and research processes for members of the college community.
As such, all members of the college community are encouraged to use these resources, provided they respect the rights of others, abide by the rules and regulations of the college, and assume shared responsibility for safeguarding the college s computing environment.
Proper and fair use is essential if all are to derive maximum benefit from them.
This policy may be modified at any time.
Use of CIT resources is considered an agreement to abide by this policy.
Users found in violation may be subject to penalties of varying degree, including temporary or permanent denial of access to CIT resources and services.
Violators may also be subject to action by college, civil, or criminal judicial systems.
Guiding Principles In making information technology resources available to all members of the college community, Oberlin College affirms its commitment to a free and open educational environment, conducive to learning and governed by legal and ethical principles.
Oberlin College values the free flow of information.
The college respects individual privacy, civility, and intellectual property rights.
Because an electronic environment is easily disrupted and electronic information is readily copied, users of the college s resources are honor-bound to promote and protect these institutional values.
Under normal circumstances, college officials will not examine personal information transmitted over the network or stored on college-owned computers.
However, the college reserves the right to monitor system resources, including activity and accounts, with or without notice, when: It is necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of college computing resources.
An account or system is engaged in unusual or excessive activity.
It has good cause to believe that regulations, rules, or laws are being violated.
In the event of health, safety, or security emergencies, as determined by authorized college officials.
When, due to the extended absence of an employee, demise of an employee, or termination of an employee for cause, as verified by the director of Human Resources or other authorized college official, it is necessary to retrieve vital college-related material.
Additionally, the normal operation and maintenance of the college s computing resources requires the backup of data, the logging of activity, the monitoring of general usage patterns, and other such activities as may be necessary in order to provide desired services.
Accordingly, all Oberlin College personnel are urged to use college-provided resources onl y for college-related material and to acquire and use personal accounts and devices for any non-work-related material.
Note that any access made to an individual s account or data will be no more extensive than necessary.
The account holder/data owner will generally be notified of access, either prior to or after access has occurred, when such notification will not be deleterious to pending or potential legal or security considerations.
User Responsibilities Access to computing resources and network capacity is a privilege to which all college faculty, staff, and students are entitled.
Access may be granted to other individuals affiliated with the college or college personnel, as situations warrant and with approval from the director of information technology.)
Certain responsibilities correspond with that privilege, including those listed below.
Since no list can cover all possible circumstances, the spirit of this policy must be respected, namely; any action that hinders legitimate computer usage or invades the privacy of another person or institution is unacceptable.

All facilities of the Center for Information Technology, including those located in remote sites, are for the use of Oberlin College students, faculty, and staff.
Spouses, partners, and children of members of these groups, with qualified needs, may apply to the director of Information Technology for the privilege of using CIT facilities.
Residents of Oberlin, Lorain County, or others, who have been granted library privileges are not automatically permitted to use CIT facilities.

Users must not abuse equipment and are asked to report any mistreatment or vandalism of computing or network facilities to CIT staff(Mudd Level A) or to the Office of Safety and Security at(440) 775-8444.
Food is discouraged in all CIT computer facilities, including remote sites operated by the CIT, because of potential harm to equipment.
Beverages in approved containers(sturdy, covered, reusable containers) are allowed.
Users should relinquish the computer they are using if they are doing nonessential work when others are waiting for a computer to perform course-related activities.
Equipment should not be monopolized.
Users should not use more than one computer at a time and should plan work so that the computer session is no longer than absolutely necessary.
Game playing in CIT-maintained computer facilities/labs is prohibited at all times.
Users should not install software, alter system files, or disconnect any cables on computers or other equipment.
Users are expected to respect other users and the staff of the Center for Information Technology.
Verbal or physical abuse of others, student or staff, will not be tolerated.
A user must show an Oberlin College ID card to any CIT staff member or CIT student employee who so requests.
Users must respect all notices(such as those concerning hours of operation, printing, etc.)
posted in CIT facilities.
Computers assigned to faculty and staff for the duration of their employment at Oberlin College remain the property of Oberlin College and should be treated as such.
These computers may be upgraded, as warranted, and must be relinquished in order for any required repairs to be performed.
Note that termination of employment could result in the immediate inability to access one s assigned computer.
Accordingly, users are encouraged to use personally-owned computers to store or process personal materials.

Information technology resources may not be used for illegal or harmful purposes, including:
intentional harassment of others;
intentional destruction or damage to equipment, software, or data;
intentional disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.

Software is normally distributed under three kinds of licenses: proprietary, public distribution, and shareware.
Unless otherwise indicated, users should assume all software made available by CIT is proprietary and may not be legally copied.
CIT will not knowingly provide support for software that a user possesses in violation of its license agreement.
Consultants and staff may ask for proof of ownership before helping users with their software.
CIT will not knowingly allow illegally acquired software to be used on Oberlin-owned computers.
CIT will remove any suspect software loaded onto Oberlin College-owned computers or servers.
CIT will not knowingly allow use of its resources(computers, equipment, network, etc.)
for the illegal copying of digital media or files.
Copyright Law protects copyright owners from the unauthorized reproduction, adaptation, or distribution of digital material, including the unauthorized use of copyrighted sound recordings(e.g., music files), video files, and interactive digital software( e., video games).

Users should not use information technology resources, including personally-owned computers connected to the college network, for noncollege, unsanctioned, commercial activity.

Users should make no attempt to alter the condition or status of any computing network component in any manner.
Users should make no attempt to alter software other than their own, or to copy software intended only for execution.
Users should not interfere with, interrupt, or obstruct the ability of others to use the network or other CIT resources.
Users should not attempt to connect to a host via the network without explicit permission of the owner.
Users should not provide, assist in, or gain unauthorized access to college computing or network resources.
Users should not attempt to circumvent or defeat computer or network security measures.
Users should not systematically collect and use any privately or publicly available college data or content, including users personal directory and account information, through the use of data mining, robots, or similar gathering and extraction methods.

Security
The college uses various measures to ensure the security of its computing resources.
Users should be aware that the college cannot guarantee such security and should apply appropriate safeguards for their accounts, such as guarding their passwords and changing passwords regularly(required for e-mail accounts), and logging out of computers when done.

Users should be aware that data stored and used within OCApps(online applications powered by Google) is inherently non-secure, and is also not backed
Thus, users must not place any confidential, sensitive, or personal data within any of the OCApps, and should not use OCApps as a primary storage location for vital data(alternative storage media should also be used).
Systems administrators of other departmental and individual computer systems are responsible for the security of information stored on those systems and for keeping those systems free from unauthorized access.
The default protection setting on CIT servers defines all files as belonging exclusively to their owner.
Unless the owner changes the protection level, no file may be read, executed, or modified by users other than the owner.
The only exception to this understanding is that designated members of the CIT staff may examine accounts or files of users to investigate security problems, possible abuse of the Oberlin College computing system, or violations of regulations.

Account holders should use only their own personal accounts unless given permission by an authorized member of the faculty, administration, or professional staff to use one that is designated for a specific purpose or job.
Account holders may not allow others to use their personal accounts.
The person holding an account is responsible for its use, and all activity originating from that account, at all times.

Account holders should protect their passwords and keep them confidential.
Passwords should be changed frequently.
Any problem resulting from irresponsible use of a password(e.g., a password that can be easily guessed or oral or written dissemination of a password) may be treated as grounds for action against the account holder.
Any attempt to determine the passwords of other users is strictly prohibited.
Account holders should not abuse any electronic mail, bulletin board, or communications system, either local or remote, by sending rude, obscene, or harassing messages(including chain letters) or by using these systems for non-essential purposes during the times when the computers are in heavy demand.
Account holders should identify themselves clearly and accurately in all electronic communications, e., no anonymous postings and no spoofing of addresses.
Unofficial mass e-mailings( e., spam) are prohibited.
Account holders should use only their own files, those that have been designated as public, or those that have been made available to them with the knowledge and consent of the owner.
Individual Oberlin College accounts(@oberlin.edu mail accounts, web accounts, etc.)
are created for the express use of the individual for whom the accounts are created, but remain the property of Oberlin College.
Accounts may be viewed in circumstances such as those delineated in paragraph B. above.
Faculty and staff accounts may also be accessed to recover work-related information in the event of the termination of employment, or the incapacitation or demise of the employee.
Accordingly, faculty and staff account holders may wish to consider acquiring a non-Oberlin account for personal correspondence.

Network Usage The following are responsibilities that are particularly applicable to users of Oberlin s campus-wide network.

Only computers that have been properly virus checked, updated, and authenticated through established procedures may be connected to the campus network, unless otherwise authorized and established by CIT.
Users must not attempt to circumvent this process.

The person recognized as the owner of that authenticated computer system is responsible for that computer s use, and all activity originating from that computer, at all times.
Excessive or improper use of network resources that inhibits or interferes with use by others is prohibited and will be cause for action by CIT, which may include restricting, limiting, or disabling network access.
Users who connect computers to the network that act as servers have the additional responsibility to respond to any use of their server that is found to be in violation of this Policy.
In no case shall the following types of servers be connected to the network: DNS, DHCP, BOOTP, or any other server that manages network addresses.
Due the serious negative impact on network availability created by misconfigured routers and Wireless Access Points(WAPs), all routers and WAPS, except those configured and used by CIT, or devices which function as routers or WAPs, are disallowed.

Enforcement Violations of this policy will be adjudicated, as deemed appropriate, and may include the following:

Introduction Clinton Community College provides its students and employees wide access to information resources and technologies.
With the advent of new forms of technology, the College has recognized that making technological resources more accessible furthers the free exchange of opinions and ideas essential to academic freedom.
Technological resources are shared by all users; misuse of these resources by some users infringes upon the opportunities of all the rest.
As Clinton Community College is a public institution of higher education, the proper use of those resources is all the more important.
That the College makes its technology available for educational purposes requires users to observe state, federal, and other legal regulations the aims of which are to safeguard privacy( e.
HIPAA, etc) equipment, networks, data and software acquired and maintained with public funds.

General responsibilities Computing resources(including, but not limited to, desktop computers, printers, central computing facilities, the local-area network, access to the Internet, electronic mail and similar electronic information) of Clinton Community College are available only to authorized users, and any use of those resources is subject to these standards.
These standards do not supercede or replace existing College policies, which will be applied as the situation warrants.
All users of the College's computing resources are presumed to have read and understood the following standards.
The College's information technology is provided to support College operations and for educational and academic research purposes, professional development, communication and publication consistent with the College's mission and goals.
The College's information technology acceptable use standards require that each user(anyone using these resources): Accept responsibility for learning how to use information technology effectively and responsibly.
The College provides training on the use of information technology.
All users are encouraged to learn the proper use of information technology through individual learning or by attending training sessions or classes.
Each user is responsible for checking computer software and data files he/she introduces to any computer on the college network for computer viruses.
Accept responsibility for backup and security of your own work.
Each user should learn how to make backup copies of important work and learn and properly use software features for securing or sharing access to their information.
Use resources efficiently.

Communication under a false name or designation or a name or designation which the user is not authorized to use, including instances in conjunction with representing that the user is somehow acting on behalf of or under the auspices of Clinton Community College is prohibited.
Recognize limitations to privacy in electronic communications.
Users may have an expectation that the contents of what they write or otherwise create, store and send be seen only by those to whom they intend or give permission to view; however, the security of electronic information on shared systems and networks is approximately that of paper documents in an unsealed or sealed envelope generally respected, but breachable by someone determined to do
E-mail should be used for college business.
Also note that, as part of their responsibilities, technical managers or other persons may need to view the contents of documents or messages to diagnose or correct problems.
Cooperate as necessary.
When necessary in the College's discretion to maintain continued reasonable services, or in cases of irresponsible use, the college may suspend user privileges or take or recommend other action deemed necessary or appropriate.
All users are expected to cooperate with investigations by resource managers or others at the College, either of technical problems or of possible unauthorized or irresponsible use as defined in these standards, College guidelines, other College policies or procedures.

Introduction The Hiram Campus Network is provided as a service to students, faculty, staff, and other members of the Hiram community.
Maintained by Hiram College Computer Center, the Network supports the instruction and strategic plan of the College.
This document outlines the policy of acceptable use of Hiram Campus Network resources, the effective protection of individual users, equitable access, and proper management of those resources.

Individual Responsibilities Hiram College strives to provide fair and distributed access to computing and network facilities for the entire community of users.
It is the intent of Hiram College to make information on the Internet available to the College community.
Members are responsible for selecting, viewing, and utilizing resources.
To foster trust and intellectual freedom, it is necessary to practice courtesy, common sense, and restraint in the use of shared resources.
Improper use of Hiram facilities may prevent others from gaining fair access to those facilities.
Furthermore, users must keep in mind that networks or systems outside of Hiram College(including those in other countries) may have their own distinctive policies and procedures.
Users are advised to learn and abide by the policies and procedures of these external networks.
Insofar as a secure and reliable computer system is necessary to the academic mission of the College, all members of the College community should contribute to the security of the system by conscientiously protecting their access privileges.
For example, users need to select a secure password andshould change their passwords every 90 days.
Users should never share their username and password with anybody nor should they ever use another person s login credentials.
Likewise, the computer system administrators will act promptly when evidence of serious compromises to the security of the system is detected.
The Hiram College computing network must work within finite limitations of bandwidth and disk space.
Users are reminded that online file storage exists on a space shared by other members of the community, and users are responsible for maintenance of their files.
Therefore users are encouraged to keep only pertinent materials in their network file share accounts.
The user should: Conserve disk space: delete unneeded files as soon as possible.
Be aware that email cannot be guaranteed to be perfectly private: others may intentionally or unintentionally forward or print your message, making it publicly available.
Like electronic mail the maintenance of a user s own storage area is the user s responsibility.
The user should: conserve server disk space; not maintain anything that the user considers to be private in the network storage area.
Files in network storage may be accessible by persons with system privileges.)

Conduct All users of the Hiram College Network must comply with all state and federals laws.
Activities that violate the Acceptable Use Policy include, but are not limited to, those in the following list: Using a computer account that does not rightfully belong to you.

Use of the College s network to download or store inappropriate materials(example: pornographic or illegally obtained copyright materials)
Authorization Personal use of Hiram College computing resources by staff employees during working hours is an issue that will be determined by the employee s supervisor.
Use of College computing and network facilities for non-academic commercial monetary gain requires the approval of the College and may require a written contract that gives full details of any financial obligation and/or charge for use, if any.
Connecting network devices, such as network hubs to the campus system will require authorization from the Director of Computing Services or his/her designee.
Setting up a domain on a computer located on the Hiram College network will require authorization from the Director of Computing Services or his/her designee.

Enforcement of Policies Failure to comply with any of the above policies may result in termination of network privileges, College disciplinary action, and/or criminal prosecution.
It is understood that users may unwittingly create problems for others by, for example, employing programs that monopolize the network bandwidth.
In such cases the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) will contact the user and explain why and how the user needs to modify his or her electronic behavior.
A policy clarification letter may be written.
In cases of repeated problematic behavior, the Director of Computing Services may recommend to the appropriate Dean or supervisor that a formal warning be placed in the user s College record.
Access to computing resources may be suspended temporarily at any time by the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) if there is clear evidence to suggest that the resource(s) are being used in a manner that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.
In such a case, the owner of the account will be sent notification of this action.
Upon suspension, a user can appeal the issue with the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) in order to reestablish an account.
The Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) may also choose to refer the case for disciplinary action in accordance with established procedures.
For students, it is as described in the Hiram College Student Handbook.

The wireless network connects to Towson University s wired network and to the Internet.
The wireless network is a supplementary adjunct to the wired network.
Whenever possible a wall port connection to the network should be used.
Acceptable uses of the wireless network at Towson University are subject to compliance with the following: All use of the wireless access points, wireless devices and adapters must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and university policies including FCC regulations and Towson University Guidelines for Responsible Computing. No user is authorized to attempt to utilize a wireless enabled device as an intermediary to providing other users access to Towson University s network.
Please refer to the policy on, Management of Wireless Networks and Access Points for more information.
Colleges and administrative units may implement additional operating policies to regulate use of wireless devices within the physical areas of their offices and classrooms.
Such policies should be made available on the department web site, must refer to this policy, and must be consistent with this policy.
Use of the wireless network is limited to portable devices.
Stationary devices(e.g., PC towers and printers) must be connected to the network via wall port access.
Wireless devices listed on the Towson Unplugged site( Recommended Hardware) are supported by OTS.
Users of these devices can request assistance in connecting to the Towson University network via OTS support services, training and documentation.
Reason for Policy: This policy is intended to assist in regulating use of the wireless network and associated radio frequencies.
The benefits include prevention of security breaches by use of unapproved hardware, avoiding monetary losses due to investigation of radio interference, and legal actions against the university due to allowing unauthorized access to the Towson University secured network and the information contained within.
Definitions: Access point is a small radio transmitter physically connected to a wired data network, which broadcasts signals for a wireless network.
OTS maintains more than 400 access points for its wireless network.
Occupied space is a place on campus where the density and frequency of people occupying the space warrants use of the wireless network.
Low occupation areas are determined by infrequent occupation or lack of programmatic occupation of a large space.
These spaces include the 12-acre wooded tract known as the Glen and some areas of the Towson University parking lots.
Residence halls are also not included in the wireless coverage.
Residence facilities obtain their Internet connectivity through vendors who are contracted to provide connectivity in those areas.
Office of Technology Services(OTS) provides technology support for the campus community and manages the university s wired and wireless networks; server hardware and software; information security services; data, telephone and video communication systems; and PeopleSoft and other related information systems.

Introduction This document constitutes a university-wide policy designed to ensure the availability of computers, data networks, services, and other computer-related resources to students, faculty, University, Los Angeles community and indicates in general, what privileges and responsibilities are characteristic of the University computing environment.
Because some networks operate in environments in which certain specific items in this policy do not apply, system administrators are free to create policies that are at a variance(although not inconsistent) to this one.
In such cases, the departmental system administrators should make relevant variances known to their users.
The following policy, rules, and conditions apply to all users of MSMU computing resources and services.
Violations of this policy are possibly unlawful.
Violations may result in disciplinary action that could result in expulsion from the University, dismissal from a position, and/or legal action.

We define them as: Networked Computer:
A computer system that is connected to any MSMU data network.
A networked computer and its peripherals that can be used by more than one person(for example, a server).
Central Facilities: Refers to networked computers and peripherals purchased, maintained, and operated by the Office of Information Technology and made available to the entire University community.
Departmental: Refers to networked computers and peripherals purchased by University departments or other administrative units, primarily for the use of the unit's personnel.
Individual: Refers to networked computers purchased for use by an individual member of the University community.
System Manager: The person or group responsible for the operation and security of one or more networked computers(the person or group with system privileges).
System Administrator: The person having executive authority over one or more networked computers or computing resources.
Electronic Communications: For the purpose of this policy statement, electronic communications includes but is not limited to email, digital files, internet services, voice mail, audio and video recordings that have been sent or received by faculty, staff, students, or other authorized users of University computing resources
General Policies Computer use has become an essential part of many University activities.
While much computing is now done on departmental or individual computers(personal computers, workstations, and mobile devices) most information sources, software, and data-networking systems reside on shared, central computers or use shared networks.
The Office of Information Technology(OIT) has responsibility for providing and maintaining shared computing tools.
Mount students, faculty, and staff may feel free to create and collaborate with colleagues both on and off campus without fear that the products of these intellectual efforts will be violated by misrepresentation, tampering, illegal access, destruction, or theft.
General policies regarding the resources the University provides are outlined in this document.
Indemnification of Liability Users of University computing resources agree that neither the University nor OIT will be responsible for any direct, indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages or losses users may incur in connection with University computing resources, data or other materials transmitted through or residing on University systems, even if the University has been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss.
In addition, users agree to defend and indemnify the University and hold the University harmless from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses(including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to any acts by user or materials or information transmitted by such user in connection with the University's systems leading wholly or partially to claims against the University and its systems by other users or third parties.
Video MSMU makes use of film, photography, video, and audio recordings to advertise, express, and share experiences on our campuses both in and out of the classroom.

Computer users may not use MSMU's computer resources in any way that may be seen as insulting, defamatory, obscene, harassing, discriminatory, threatening, disruptive, nd policies, the mission of the University, as well as all federal, California, and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances.
Availability MSMU will make its computing resources and networks available to users with the fewest interruptions as possible.

Specific Policies Specific applications, such as email, and special circumstances require policies to regulate usage.
Email Attachment Policy In an attempt to reduce problems caused by virus and malware, all inbound and outbound email is automatically scanned.
The following file types are not allowed to be sent or received through the email system or stored in a University mailbo *.SCR *.PIF *.COM *.EXE *.CMD *.BAT.
These file types are often used in phishing attempts, are not typically associated with any word processing, spreadsheet or database application, and do not represent any type of image or graphic file.
If an attachment is found, the email will be quarantined and the file deleted based solely on the attachment having one of these six extensions.
If you need to send or receive a legitimate file with one of these six extensions, you will need to rename the file to a different extension or have the sender rename the file and provide instructions on returning it to its original type/extension after downloading it to your desktop.
Music/Video File Downloading Policy Downloading and streaming music from sites authorized by the owners of the copyrighted music, whether or not such sites charge a fee, is permitted on the Mount Network.
Downloading unauthorized music from pirate sites(web or FTP) or peer-to-peer systems or making unauthorized copies of music available to others(that is, uploading music) on peer-to-peer systems is not allowed and may be a violation of copyright and intellectual property laws.
OIT will blacklist pirate sites and attempt to block downloads of music and video files.

Connecting to the Internet from Residence Halls High-speed access to the Mount campus network is provided to students residing on campus.
Each dormitory room is configured with an Ethernet connection and wireless network access.
The Ethernet connection can be used to physically connect a computer or other devices to the University's Internet and email services.
In order to use the Ethernet connection, a network cable is required, and a computer must be equipped with a 100/1000mb network interface card.
The main Wireless network is MSMU Wireless, which should be used by students for the best experience.
The MSMULA Guest wireless network has limited speed and requires MSMU sponsorship.
Students may sponsor their guest on campus.
Guest access must be renewed after 24 hours.
Residents may not set up wireless access points in residence hall rooms.
Personal routers and wireless hotspots are prohibited and will be disabled by OIT.

Security of Shared Resources MSMU will assist users of its central computing resources to protect the information that is stored on those resources from accidental loss, tampering, or other unauthorized access.
Security measures implemented on each central or campus resource can be requested from the system administrator.
In the event of data loss or damage due to inadvertent or non-malicious actions, OIT will make a reasonable effort to restore the data.
The ultimate responsibility for protecting digital information and data rests with the data owners and individual computer users.
All computer system users are to assume there is no privacy of files stored in public volumes on shared or personal computer resources accessible by the campus community as a whole.
Users may request that arrangements be made to provide additional protection for information stored on such resources.
These requests will be honored within limitations of the systems administrator managing the resource.
The system administrators of shared and individual computing resources are responsible for the security of information stored on those resources, for making appropriate information on security procedures available to users of those systems, and for keeping those systems free from unauthorized access.
Although it may be possible to connect to other systems through the network, this ability does not imply the right to make use of these systems without proper authorization.
All users of any networking resources should be cautious when downloading files to protect one's confidentiality and security and to guard against viruses and malware.

Confidentiality OIT will attempt to maintain the security, privacy, and appropriate confidentiality of all information stored on University computing resources.
However, there are legitimate reasons for persons other than the account holder to access files, computers, or network traffic: including ensuring the continued integrity, security, or effective operation of University computing systems; to protect user or system data; to ensure continued effective departmental operations; to ensure appropriate use of University computing systems; or to satisfy a lawful court order.
Users should not expect information stored on central computing resources to remain confidential from those who need to know for reasons of operational necessity, or in instances where the University has reason to believe the resources are being used in a way that is inconsistent with the University's institutional purposes or mission or in violation of University policies.
On the computer network, every user is assigned an individual account, which is for the exclusive use of the owner.
Messages and email transmitted to other users should always identify the sender.
Obscenities should not be transmitted.
The University reserves the right to access and disclose as necessary, all messages sent over its systems, without regard to content and without permission from faculty, staff, and students.
However, it will do so only to prevent or correct improper use, satisfy a legal obligation, or ensure proper use of the email system.
If any computing resource user has evidence that his or her privacy or other rights have been infringed upon by another user, the affected party may ask for monitoring or inspection through the appropriate University office or legal authority.
All individuals involved in authorizing the monitoring must keep permanent copies of requests.

Censorship Free expression of ideas is central to the academic process.
MSMU computer system administrators will not remove any information from individual accounts or applications unless the appropriate system administrator discovers that:
The presence of the information is illegal(e.g., copyrighted material, software used in violation of a license agreement, etc.
or in violation of federal, California, and other applicable laws, regulations and ordinances(e.g.
policies, laws and regulations prohibiting harassment, discrimination, retaliation; and/or violation of privacy rights);
The information in some way endangers computing resources or the information of other users(e.g., a computer worm, virus, malware, or other destructive or malicious program)
The information is inappropriate because it is unrelated to or is inconsistent with rules and policies, the mission of the University; or d. The information is not in compliance with the Restrictions on Usage listed in the section, "Responsibilities of the User."
OIT may remove from shared computers or applications any information that is inappropriate, as defined above.
Specific guidelines for appropriate use of each MSMU application will be available on that system.
Users whose information is removed will be notified by the system administrator of the removal as soon as is feasible.
Users who wish to appeal such removal of information may do so through an appeal board made up of the governing body appropriate to the system and status of the user.
If no appeal board exists, then in such cases, the appeal may be made to the Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and Strategic Initiatives & Chief Technology Officer(CTO)
Responsibilities of the User Access to computing resources is a privilege made available to all University faculty, staff, and students, not a right.
Certain responsibilities accompany that privilege, and understanding them is important for all computer users.
Institutional Purposes Use of MSMU computing-related resources is for purposes related to the University's mission.
All members of the community must be responsible stewards of these resources.
Each user may use computing resources only for purposes related to their studies, their instruction, the discharge of their duties as employees, their official business with the University, and other University-sanctioned activities.
The use of MSMU computing resources for academically related but commercial purposes is permitted only with approval of the Provost and the VP of Strategic Initiatives & Chief Technology Officer(CTO).
When faculty or staff utilize computing and technical resources not owned, managed or maintained by the University to conduct University business such as teaching and/or other administrative tasks, using the University network, they will abide by the terms and conditions contained within this Acceptable Use Policy.
Security Each computer user is responsible for the correct use of the applications and tools provided for maintaining the security and confidentiality of stored digital information.
For example: Computer accounts, passwords and other types of authorization belong to individual users and must not be shared with others.
Each user is responsible for making authorized use of resources only for intended purposes, and is responsible for all transactions made under their assigned account.
The user must select an obscure account password and change it frequently.
The user must understand the level of protection each computer system automatically provides for files and supplement it, if necessary, for sensitive information.
The computer user must be aware of computer viruses, malware, and phishing schemes, and take steps to avoid being their victim.

The University expects individuals to be careful, honest, responsible, and civil in the use of the University network, computers and information technology.
Computer, technology and network facilities are primarily for educational and administrative use.
These facilities have tangible value.
Attempts to circumvent accounting/information systems or to use the accounts of others will be treated as forms of attempted theft and prosecuted accordingly.
Individuals must not attempt to damage or degrade the performance of Lindenwood's computers and/or network and must not disrupt the work of other users.
Individuals must not attempt to circumvent security systems or to exploit/probe for security holes in any Lindenwood network or system.
In addition, individuals must not attempt any such activity against other public or private systems accessed through Lindenwood's facilities.

Moreover the possession or collection of others passwords is prohibited.
Physical theft, rearrangement, or damage to any University computer, technology, network equipment, facilities, or property is strictly prohibited, and will be prosecuted according to applicable laws and enforcement methods.
This includes all public computer labs, network equipment, wiring and links.
Users with personal computers on the Lindenwood network are expected to take reasonable precautions to ensure the security of their systems.
All computers require a valid, up-to-date virus-scanning program.
Individuals may be held responsible for any misuse that occur on their systems.
Users are not permitted to register external domain names that reference systems on the Lindenwood network.
Using the Lindenwood network for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.
Connecting any secondary physical network to the Lindenwood network without authorization is strictly prohibited.
Providing services or running applications that consume excessive bandwidth on the Lindenwood network is prohibited.
No Lindenwood system is to be used for any illegal or criminal purpose.

Because the Lindenwood network and Internet connections are shared by many university services(the University Library, Lindenwood University website, Electronic Mail, etc.
the Lindenwood Information Technology departments actively monitors network traffic to ensure reliable service for everyone.
File sharing software can account for a large portion of traffic on our network.
As such, network traffic shaping may be used to address instances of misuse or policy violation.
Streaming media(such as streaming video, streaming audio programs, etc.)
are permitted as they use significantly less bandwidth.
However, during peak hours, any bandwidth-intensive application may be terminated to ensure continued services to the rest of the university.
If you have file sharing applications on your computer, you must remove them.
Simply disabling these applications may not mitigate their effect on the Lindenwood network as these applications share your computer with the entire Internet in the background, generating an enormous amount of traffic.
If you have any questions, please contact the Information Technology Help Desk at x5100.
Copyright Compliance As a part of its compliance with federal copyright law, Lindenwood University deploys a procedure to respond to bona fide notices of copyright violation by copyright holders.
This procedure operates as follows: The Digital Millennium Copyright Agent for the university requests that the Network Operations Center block the Internet Protocol(IP) address alleged by the notice to be in violation of federal law and provide the agent with the identity of the user or party responsible for the computer(responsible party).
The agent then notifies the user or responsible party of the notice and requests a cease and desist statement.
Upon receipt of that statement, the agent then requests that the Network Operations Center unblock the IP address.
Because intentional file sharing of material for which the user does not have the copyright holder's permission is a violation of the University policy, the user shall be reported to the Provosts Office for disciplinary processing.
In the case where the copyright notice is the result of a computer compromise(electronic activities that cause damage to a computer), or a "hacking," and not the intentional activity of file sharing on the part of the computers user, the agent shall instruct the user to fix the computer or to make an appointment with the Helpdesk(helpdesk@Lindenwood.edu) to have it fixed.
The agent will request the block be lifted upon receipt of information that the machine has been repaired.
Obscene or Harassing Electronic Communications Obscene or harassing electronic communication is prohibited, as are messages that target individuals in a threatening manner.
Individuals who send such communications will be reported to the proper authorities.
Lindenwood Department of Information Technology reserves the right to monitor any computer activity on a Lindenwood computer or any computer connected to the Lindenwood network.

Examples of misuse include using a computer account and/or obtaining a password that you are not authorized to use, using the campus network to gain unauthorized access to any computer system and using a "sniffer" or other methods in an attempt to "crack" passwords.
Clearly and accurately identify one s self in electronic communications.
Do not forge or misrepresent one s identity.
Concealing or masking the identity of electronic communications such as altering the source of an email message by making it appear as if the message was sent by someone else is a violation of this policy.
Use computer and network resources efficiently.
Computing resources are finite and must be shared.
Users may use the University s computer and network resources for incidental personal purposes, provided that such use does not(A) unreasonably interfere with the use of computing and network resources by other users, or with the University s operation of computing and network resources;(B) interfere with the user s employment or other obligations to the University; or(C) violate this policy or other applicable policy or law.
The university retains the right to set priorities on use of the system, and to limit recreational or personal uses when such uses could reasonably be expected to cause, directly or indirectly, strain on any computing facilities, or to interfere with research, instructional or administrative computing requirements, or to violate applicable policies or laws.
Examples of inappropriate use include sending unsolicited e-mails, newsgroups, or other means(SPAM), sending chain letters or engaging in pyramid schemes, large downloads of illegal material(music or movies) etc. Do not harass or intimidate or use computer and network resources for unlawful acts.
The University, in general, cannot and does not wish to be the arbiter of content maintained, distributed or displayed by users of the University s computing and network resources.
For example, the University, in general, cannot protect users from receiving e-mail they may find offensive.
Using the University s computer or network resources for illegal activities, however, is strictly prohibited.
Unlawful use of University computer and network resources can expose the individual user and the University to damage claims, or potential criminal liability.

Any form of original expression fixed in a tangible medium is subject to copyright, even if there is no copyright notice.
Examples include music, movies, graphics, text, photographs, artwork and software, distributed in any media -- including online.
The use of a copyrighted work(such as copying, downloading, file sharing, distribution, public performance, etc.)
requires either(A) the copyright owner s permission, or(B) an exemption under the Copyright Act.
The law also makes it unlawful to circumvent technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.
Copyright infringement exposes the user, and possibly the University, to heavy fines and potential criminal liability.
Therefore, without limitation of other possible sanctions, the University may refuse, suspend and/or terminate computer and network access, with respect to any user who violates the copyright law, or who uses the University s computer or network resources contrary to the terms of the University s software or database license agreements.

Authorized university personnel(e.g.
system, network and database administrators, among others) may have access to data beyond what is generally available.
Privileged access to data may only be used in a way consistent with applicable laws, University policies, and accepted standards of professional conduct.
Those who have access to databases that include personal information shall respect individual privacy and confidentiality, consistent with applicable laws and University policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
Users should be aware however that state laws and university policies, guidelines and regulations may prevent the protection of certain aspects of individual privacy.
Both the nature of electronic communications, and the public character of the University s business make certain uses less private than users may anticipate.
For example,, in certain circumstances, the University may permit the inspection, monitoring or disclosure of e-mail, consistent with applicable laws and with the University s Electronic Mail Policy.
Respect and adhere to other departmental/college/Internet Service Provider's acceptable use policies.
When using a university computer system and/or network to connect to a non Concordia University Wisconsin system or network, adhere to the prevailing policies governing that system or network.
This does not in any way release your obligation to abide by the established policies governing the use of Concordia University Wisconsin computer systems and networks.
Consequences of Misuse and/or Non-Compliance Users who misuse University computing and network resources or who fail to comply with the University s written usage policies, regulations and guidelines are subject to one or more of the following consequences: Temporary deactivation of computer/network access Permanent deactivation of computer/network access Disciplinary actions taken by the Office of the Vice President of Student Life up to and including expulsion from school or termination of employment Subpoena of data files Legal prosecution under applicable Federal and State laws Possible penalties under the law, including fines and imprisonment Violations, complaints and questions should be reported to the Director of Computing Operations at 262.243.4526.

Do's and Don'ts of Using WiFi There are two types of Public WiF Secured and unsecured.
When in range, you can connect to an unsecured network without any type of security features like a password or login.
Conversely, a secured network requires a user to agree to legal terms, register an account, or type in a password before connecting to the network.
It may also have an associated fee or store purchase to gain access to the password or network.
Regardless of the connection type, you should always use public WiFi with caution.
Here are some do s and don'ts: Do connect to secured public networks whenever possible.
If you are unable to connect to a secured network, using an unsecured network would be permissible if the connection requires some sort of login or registration.
Don't access personal bank accounts, or sensitive personal data, on unsecured public networks.
Even secured networks can be risky.
Use your best judgment if you must access these accounts on public WiF
Don't leave your laptop, tablet, or smartphone unattended in a public place.
Even if you are working on a secure WiFi network, that will not stop someone from taking your property or sneaking a peek at your device.
Don't shop online when using public WiF
Sure, shopping may not seem like it involves sensitive data, but making purchases online requires personal information that could include bank account and retailer login credentials.
Shopping is not something you want to do on an unsecured WiFi network.
Do turn off automatic connectivity.
Most smartphones, laptops, and tablets have automatic connectivity settings, which allow you to connect from one hotspot to the next seamlessly.
This is a convenient feature, but it can also connect your devices to networks you ordinarily would not use.
Keep these settings turned off, especially when you are traveling to unfamiliar places.
Do monitor your Bluetooth connectivity.
Bluetooth in the home is a fantastic feature on many smart devices.
However, leaving Bluetooth on while in public places can pose a considerable risk to your cybersecurity.
Bluetooth connectivity allows various devices to communicate with each other, and a hacker can look for open Bluetooth signals to gain access to your devices.
Keep this function on your phone, and other devices locked down when you leave your home, office, or similar secured area.
If you require additional assistance, please contact the IT Service Center at itservicecenter@tsu.edu, http://itservicecenter.tsu.edu or 713-313-4357 with any questions.

Use of the wireless network should be in conformance with the college s Policy on the Policy on the Acceptable Use of Computer Resources.
Wireless networking is a broadcast and shared form of communication, and as such presents a variety of additional issues and security risks that are not present with a wired connection.
Wireless data protocols also use the shared 2.4 GHz frequency airspace which is open and used by a variety of other technologies, including cordless phones, microwave ovens, and BlueTooth devices; this also presents reliability and performance issues for wireless networking.
Therefore, Smith College has adopted the following policies and recommendations relating to the deployment and use of wireless networking on the college s network.
Smith Guest network access is offered for temporary use to guests of the Smith College community; it offers limited bandwidth and restricted access to Smith services.
Smith Guest access should not be used by Smith students, faculty or staff, except as needed for short term Internet access while resolving authenticated network access problems.
Only wireless access points provided and installed by ITS, or authorized and approved by ITS, are permitted on the college s campus LAN.
Personal access points are not permitted; where such devices are found connected to the network, data access to that location will be disabled until the access point is removed.
Client computers with wireless network interface cards(NICs) are not permitted to be configured to act as access points.
When conflicts arise between devices using the 2.4 Ghz airspace and Smith's wireless LAN, precedence will be granted to the wireless data network.
Exceptions can be granted; requests for an exemption to this policy should be directed to the college CIO.
Departments may request wireless network access in specific locations not currently covered by submitting an application to the Director of Network Operations or to designated alternates.
Smith does not currently require all wireless communications to be encrypted, but use of the Smith Secure wireless mode is very strongly encouraged.
Use of other secure communications options, such as SSH and HTTPS, is also highly recommended when such options are available.
Access to Banner data or other Smith business systems via wireless access, regardless of location on or off campus, is strongly discouraged, even when using encrypted protocols.

Your Rights and Responsibilities As a member of the College community, the College provides you with the use of scholarly and/or work-related tools, including access to the Library, to certain computer systems, servers, software and databases, to the campus telephone and voice mail systems, and to the Internet.
You have a reasonable expectation of unobstructed use of these tools, of certain degrees of privacy(which may vary depending on whether you are a College employee or a matriculated student), and of protection from abuse and intrusion by others sharing these resources.
You can expect your right to access information and to express your opinion to be protected as it is for paper and other forms of non-electronic communication.
In turn, you are responsible for knowing the regulations and policies of the College that apply to appropriate use of the College's technologies and resources.
You are responsible for exercising good judgment in the use of the College's technological and information resources.
Just because an action is technically possible does not mean that it is appropriate to perform that action.
As a representative of the Keuka College community, you are expected to respect the College's good name in your electronic dealings with those outside the College.
Policy Acceptable Use You may use only the computers, computer accounts, and computer files for which you have authorization.
You may not use another individual's account, or attempt to capture or guess other users' passwords.
You are individually responsible for appropriate use of all resources assigned to you, including the computer, the network address or port, software and hardware.
Therefore, you are accountable to the College for all use of such resources.
As an authorized Keuka College user of resources, you may not enable unauthorized users to access the network by using a Keuka College computer or a personal computer that is connected to the Keuka College network.
The College is bound by its contractual and license agreements respecting certain third party resources; you are expected to comply with all such agreements when using such resources.
You should make a reasonable effort to protect your passwords and to secure resources against unauthorized use or access.
You must configure hardware and software in a way that reasonably prevents unauthorized users from accessing Keuka College's network and computing resources.
You must not attempt to access restricted portions of the network, an operating system, security software or other administrative applications without appropriate authorization by the system owner or administrator.
You must comply with the policies and guidelines for any specific set of resources to which you have been granted access.
When other policies are more restrictive than this policy, the more restrictive policy takes precedence.
You must not use Keuka College computing and/or network resources in conjunction with the execution of programs, software, processes, or automated transaction-based commands that are intended to disrupt(or that could reasonably be expected to disrupt) other computer or network users, or damage or degrade performance, software or hardware components of a system.
On Keuka College network and/or computing systems, do not use tools that are normally used to assess security or to attack computer systems or networks(e.g., password 'crackers,' vulnerability scanners, network sniffers, etc.)
unless you have been specifically authorized to do so by the KC Information Systems & Security Group.
Fair Share of Resources Computing and Information Services, and other College departments which operate and maintain computers, network systems and servers, expect to maintain an acceptable level of performance and must assure that frivolous, excessive, or inappropriate use of the resources by one person or a few people does not degrade performance for others.
The campus network, computer clusters, mail servers and other central computing resources are shared widely and are limited, requiring that resources be utilized with consideration for others who also use them.
Therefore, the use of any automated processes to gain technical advantage over others in the Keuka College community is explicitly forbidden.
The College may choose to set limits on an individual's use of a resource through quotas, time limits, and other mechanisms to ensure that these resources can be used by anyone who needs them.
Please review the Fair Share of Resources section of the "Acceptable Use Examples" for further clarification.
AH1] Adherence with Federal, State, and Local Laws As a member of the Keuka College community, you are expected to uphold local ordinances and state and federal law.
Some Keuka College guidelines related to use of technologies derive from that concern, including laws regarding license and copyright, and the protection of intellectual property.
As a user of Keuka College's computing and network resources you must: Abide by all federal, state, and local laws.
Abide by all applicable copyright laws and licenses.
Keuka College has entered into legal agreements or contracts for many of our software and network resources which require each individual using them to comply with those agreements.
Observe the copyright law as it applies to music, videos, games, images, texts and other media in both personal use and in production of electronic information.
The ease with which electronic materials can be copied, modified and sent over the Internet makes electronic materials extremely vulnerable to unauthorized access, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.
Do not use, copy, or distribute copyrighted works(including but not limited to Web page graphics, sound files, film clips, trademarks, software and logos) unless you have a legal right to use, copy, distribute, or otherwise exploit the copyrighted work.
Doing so may provide the basis for disciplinary action, civil litigation and criminal prosecution.
Other Inappropriate Activities Use Keuka College s computing facilities and services for those activities that are consistent with the educational, research and public service mission of the College.
Other prohibited activities include: Activities that would jeopardize the College's tax-exempt status Use of Keuka College s computing services and facilities for political purposes Use of Keuka College's computing services and facilities for personal economic gain Privacy and Personal Rights All users of the College s network and computing resources are expected to respect the privacy and personal rights of others.
Do not access or copy another user's email, data, programs, or other files without the written permission of Keuka College s Director of Information Systems & Security/Chief Information Officer.
Be professional and respectful when using computing systems to communicate with others; the use of computing resources to libel, slander, or harass any other person is not allowed and could lead to College discipline as well as legal action by those who are the recipient of these actions.
While the College does not generally monitor or limit content of information transmitted on the campus network, it reserves the right to access and review such information under certain conditions.
These include: investigating performance deviations and system problems(with reasonable cause), determining if an individual is in violation of this policy, or, as may be necessary, to ensure that Keuka College is not subject to claims of institutional misconduct.
Access to files on College-owned equipment or information will only be approved by specific personnel when there is a valid reason to access those files.
Authority to access user files can only come from the Director of Information Systems & Security/Chief Information Officer in conjunction with requests and/or approvals from senior members of the College.
External law enforcement agencies and Keuka College Human Resources/Campus Safety may request access to files through valid subpoenas and other legally binding requests.
All such requests must be approved by the General Counsel.
Information obtained in this manner can be admissible in legal proceedings or in a College hearing.
Privacy in Email While every effort is made to insure the privacy of Keuka College email users, this may not always be possible.
In addition, since employees are granted use of electronic information systems and network services to conduct College business, there may be instances when the College, based on approval from authorized officers, reserves and retains the right to access and inspect stored information without the consent of the user.
User Compliance When you use College computing services, and accept any College issued computing accounts, you agree to comply with this and all other computing related policies.
You have the responsibility to keep up-to-date on changes in the computing environment, as published, using College electronic and print publication mechanisms, and to adapt to those changes as necessary.

ELECTRONIC MAIL(EMAIL) 3.1 This policy establishes the applicability of law and other Bluefield State College policies relating to electronic mail.
The College recognizes that principles of academic freedom and shared governance, freedom of speech, and privacy of information hold important implications for electronic mail and electronic mail services.
The College affords electronic mail privacy protections comparable to that which it traditionally affords paper mail and telephone communications.
The College encourages the use of electronic mail and respects the privacy of users.
It consent.
Nonetheless, subject to the requirements for authorization, notification, and other conditions specified in this policy, the College may deny access to its electronic mail services and may inspect, monitor, or disclose electronic mail when required by and electronic mail and accepts no responsibility for the content of electronic mail.
Although it is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic message stored or communicated through the computing facilities, this policy articulates the procedures adopted to provide users with a secure mail environment.
Electronic mail is a privileged communication between the parties involved and will be subjected to the same protection afforded traditional paper mail.
The purpose of this section is to describe(1) Qualifications for Email,(2) Postmaster Responsibilities,(3) Undelivered Email,(4)
1 Qualification for Email: All Bluefield State College faculty, staff, students, and alumni qualify to receive an email account.
Email accounts will be automatically created for any person who is an entering student or for any faculty or staff personnel upon employment.
As of August 19, 2013, all Bluefield State College business related communications among students, staff, and faculty members will be conducted via the official Bluefield State College email system.
Students must utilize the official Bluefield State College email account that is assigned upon admission to the institution.
Staff and faculty members must utilize the official Bluefield State College email account that is furnished upon initial employment.
Other Email domains such as @hotmail.com, @yahoo.com, @msn.com, @gmail.com, etc.
will not be recognized as official communication from Bluefield State College.
Information about these accounts is attainable through the College Computing Services department in Suite 123 of Dickason Hall.
2 Postmaster Responsibilities: The postmaster is the person assigned responsibility for dealing with email related issues at Bluefield State College.
It may be necessary at times for the postmaster to read an electronic mail header which has failed to reach its destination to determine, if possible, the intended addressee and redirect the message to the correct address.
However, it is not the practice of the postmaster to read or to discuss the content of any message.
The postmaster is a staff member of the Bluefield State College technology area and is assigned by the Director of Computer Services.
The postmaster will read the mail only to the extent necessary to assist in proper mail delivery.
Copies of the messages will not be retained after successful redirection, nor will the postmaster discuss the contents of the messages with others.
3 Undeliverable Email: The computer system automatically forwards all undeliverable mail to the designated postmaster and/or returns it to the sender.
This is a standard feature of many mail systems.
Typically, the postmaster checks the address and, where appropriate, re- sends the message to the correct address.
In general, incorrectly addressed outgoing mail is ignored, while incoming email is redirected to its intended recipient.
4 Email Violations: In general, policies and restrictions outlined in state(Electronic Mail Protection Act, West Virginia Statute, House Bill 2627) and federal laws and the Faculty, Classified Staff or Student Handbooks are applicable when using electronic mail.
Specific examples include, but are not limited to the following: Forged Mail- It is a violation of this policy to forge an electronic mail signature or to make it appear as though it originated from a different person.
Intimidation- It is a violation of this policy to send electronic mail that is abusive or threatens an individual's safety.
The use of electronic mail for sexual, ethnic, religious, or other minority harassment is also prohibited.
Known threats to personal safety will be reported to Campus Police.
Harassment- It is a violation of this policy to use electronic mail to harass an individual.
This includes sending or forwarding chain letters, deliberately flooding a user's mailbox with automatically generated mail, inappropriate email messages, and sending mail that is deliberately designed to interfere with proper mail delivery or access.
Unauthorized Access- It is a violation of this policy to attempt to gain access to another person's mail files regardless of whether the access was successful or whether or not the messages accessed involved personal information.
Illegal Use of Mail Services- It is not only a violation of this policy to send copyrighted materials electronically - it is a federal offense.
All violations will be dealt with accordingly and/or reported to the proper authorities.
Chain Letters/Junk Email It is a violation of College policy to send chain letters and junk email.
A chain letter is a letter sent originally through national and international mail services and now through networks such as the Internet.
The original intent was for young people, mostly students, to meet peers of the world.
Writers shared such things as their community environment, their schools, their friends, and many times about their family life.
Junk email is email sent as commercial transactions, personal business, and other non-College activities.
The negative side to chain letters and junk email on the Internet, or any other network, is that it fills the net and the mail servers with useless junk at the expense of the subscribers who use the Internet mail legitimately.
Spam servers.
Spam is exploiting servers or similar broadcast systems for purposes beyond their intended scope.
Hoaxes It is a violation of College policy to distribute an email hoax with the intention to mislead or trick others into believing or accepting or doing something, so as to bring about the belief in or acceptance of what is actually false.
Attachments Attachments are any items added in addition to the original email being created.
Attachments must adhere to the section on illegal use of the mail services above.
Attachments have a direct effect on all mail servers and recipients, so an attachment should not exceed 10
Large attachments should never be sent in mass mailing.
5 Discovery of Illegal Activity: Any messages whose content is clearly illegal should mpus official(s) or to the Campus Police Office.
Such items might be discovered as part of normal Postmaster activity, dead letter processing, contact from local/state/government agencies or other tasks.
Examples might include messages containing illegally obtained credit card numbers, telephone authorization codes, grade reports, criminal conspiracy, illegal transmission of copyrighted materials, or similar items.
Users will be held accountable for all actions performed with their email account, including those actions performed by other individuals as a result of user negligence.
6 File Backup: Mail files are copied as a routine aspect of system backups.
This is an automatic process that does not involve any human reading of the files copied.
Such practices are not considered a violation of privacy.
letters in order to re-read them in the future.
Storage of electronic email requires disk storage on a server or tcomputer, but email stored on the College server is subject to the Email Postmaster, and the Postmaster retains the right to delete items from any mailbox and/or the trash folder that are older than months.
8 Email Violations Procedure: The College reserves the right to authorize disconnecting a user's account if the user represents a threat to system or mail integrity.
As part of an investigation, the College may examine mail files, logs, and any other appropriate documents or testimony.
The appropriate Faculty, Staff or Student Handbook, local, state or federal law, shall determine any necessary disciplinary action.
SECTION
PORNOGRAPHY 4.1 The College aims to prevent its staff, students, visitors and contractors from having unnecessary contact with pornographic material accessed through the Information Technology Environment(ITE).
Contact with such material may not only be offensive but could also be construed as a form of harassment.
All types of harassment are unacceptable, discriminatory and, in certain circumstances, unlawful.
This Code aims, in particular, to prevent and address harassment arising from the use of College ITE facilities, or ITE facilities used on College premises, to access, display, generate, distribute, forward or store pornographic material.
The College seeks to maximize the opportunities afforded by ITE for teaching, research, and administration; however these facilities must be used acceptably, responsibly, and legally.
In particular, using ITE facilities to access, display, generate, distribute, forward or store material which may be offensive, pornographic, obscene or abusive is unacceptable and, in many cases, illegal.
All such incidents will be treated seriously and could provide grounds for disciplinary action leading to dismissal or expulsion from the College.
The College takes breaches of this Code seriously and will co-operate with efforts to prosecute anyone using its ITE facilities unlawfully.
If College ITE facilities are used in connection with pornographic material, a complaint should be made to the Chief Technology Officer the Director of Human Resources, or the head of department/division who will decide if the matter should be reported to Campus Police Office or if it can be dealt with by the College procedures outlined below.
1 Reasons for this Policy: Using ITE facilities in connection with pornographic material is unacceptable to the College and may also be contrary to federal or state law.
Furthermore, using ITE facilities in connection with pornographic material also ment has legal implications in
various types of legislation, including Health and Safety law.
If such activities are not reaching negative implications.
2 Definitions: ITE pornography is understood by the College to be material of an explicit sexual nature which is made available, displayed, generated, distributed, forwarded or stored using ITE facilities such as the internet, software packages, email, storage devices, mobile devices or computer hardware.
The pornographic material may be in the form of visual texts, including photographs or moving images, such as video files including mpg, avi, and ram files, or written texts and may depict, for example, bestiality, pedophilia, sexual torture, incest, lewd display of genitalia, or depictions of lewd sexual activity.
The College acknowledges two exceptions to the Code outlined here.
Firstly, the College is mindful that there is legitimate study and research into ITE pornography and associated issues and this is the only reason for deliberately accessing such material.
Individuals must be able to show that the access is necessary to their work or studies and they are expected to exercise discretion to ensure that the spirit of the should take great care also that the material is not stored or displayed in a way that would offend others who may come into contact with
Secondly, there may be incidents involving the unsolicited receipt of ITE pornography and the College would NOT discipline an individual in such circumstances.
3 ITE Pornography Complaints Procedure: Action may be taken at two levels to address complaints of ITE pornography and these are outlined below.
In less serious cases, it may be sufficient that disciplinary action is taken by the appropriate College authorities, such as systems managers.
Other cases will be referred to Campus Police.
A member of the Campus Police will decide on the severity of the offence.
In general, the College will hand to the police incidents in which there is: pornographic material involving moving images; pornographic text or images with personal reference to the recipient; pornographic material circulated from Bluefield State College to other organizations; pornographic material of a pedophile nature or containing references to bestiality.
Advice on dealing with complaints about ITE pornography can also be obtained from the Chief Technology Officer or the Director of Human Resources.
4 Faculty/Staff: Any member of the faculty or staff found to have transgressed this policy with regard to ITE pornography will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with their conditions of service.
Disciplinary action may take the form of a verbal or written warning and, for serious misconduct, demotion, transfer or dismissal.
Incidents of a more serious nature will also be referred to the Campus Police and the College authorities will be informed.
5 Students: Any student found to have transgressed this Policy with regard to ITE pornography will be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the Student Handbook.
6 Monitoring: Incidents of ITE pornography dealt with by the College including those referred to the Campus Police will be tracked on an annual basis by Computing Services.
7 Responsibilities: The cooperation of all College staff, students, contractors and visitors is essential to ensure the success of this policy.
The College is committed to acting positively to prevent and address incidents involving pornography and is involved in programs of staff training to heighten awareness about this important matter as needed.
SECTION
WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS(WLAN) OR WIFI 5.1 uncontrolled or unauthorized access that could result in intellectual property loss or data destruction and to provide a consistent interface and procedure for use by the Bluefield State community.
Wireless Local Area Networks(WLAN) or WiFi networks are by nature an open transport technology that can be inherently insecure and therefore any authorized by Computer Services prior to procurement and implementation.
1 General Principles and Guidelines: Security and access control will be implemented and any visitor to Bluefield State College requiring wireless access may be required to register with Computer Services prior to date needed allowing 24 hours for the request to be processed.
Computer Services will work to maintain internet access as open as possible consistent with security requirements.
Radio propagation and channel management will be controlled by Computer Services to prevent interference and unintentional spill.
All wireless access nodes added must be approved and configured by Computer Services to ensure appropriate security is enabled and correct operation with existing equipment.
No wireless device can be used to provide private network services for downstream unregistered user equipment or services.
Commercial propagation of -approved by Computer Services.
Computer Services will monitor the network for rogue wireless implementations and has the authority to disable and disconnect immediately upon detection.
Any breach of this policy may result in network privileges being revoked.
Computer Services will work with departments to accommodate special needs, where technically feasible and cost justifiable.
Computer Services will collaborate with academic departments where devices used for specific educational or research applications may require specific solutions.
Wireless networking has the potential to make it very easy to gain unauthorized access to the College network based resources.
However, the Privacy Act 1993 places an onus on organizations to protect information from inappropriate access by unauthorized parties.
There is a significant amount of only authorized people have access to this resource.
SECTION
Surveys and inquiries which are addressed to Bluefield State College faculty, staff, and/or students must be approved and administered by an official unit of the College.
The survey instrument may also require approval by the Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness.
Surveys conducted on or off campus in the name of the College by an official unit of the College should be relevant to the surveyed constituency.
Procedures and survey request and requirements document can be found on the Institutional Research and Effectiveness website.
SECTION
COMMENTARY: INTRODUCTION AND ANALOGIES 7.1 The Information Technology Environment discussed above consists, not only, of the superficial wires, equipment and devices of the data, voice, video, and more conventional information networks on our campuses(and the world) but also the more subtle milieu created by the integration of these technologies into our everyday life situations.
In this respect the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts and thus the effect of inappropriate use of this resource can be much greater than might be imagined.
This should not be a cause for hesitation about its use but merely a call for thoughtful consideration of action.
In describing the responsibilities and acceptable behaviors related to the Information Technology Environment, certain analogies can be drawn.
Social norms, behaviors, and responsibilities associated with the use of electronic communication, publication, media, and access authorization are no different than the conventional mediums with which we are all familiar, e.
Email or electronic mail is just another form of mail or communications, Posting to a news group is the same as posting a notice or comment on a bulletin board, newsletter, letter to the editor, call to a talk show, etc., Participating in a chat group is the same as participating in discussions anywhere a group might congregate face-to-face e.g.
in a class, the student center, recreation room, lounge, church group, etc., Creating a WWW or World Wide Web presence is publishing( e., making public) a Consequently, the person is not only, typically, the author but also, perhaps more importantly, the person becomes the editor and publisher and is responsible for their publication from a legal standpoint.
Even though Bluefield State College is not the publisher, editor, or author it is the provider of the resource and, as such, is associated with the publication.
Therefore, Bluefield State College maintains the right to restrict or deny use of this resource when usage does not promote or support the mission of the College or the State of West Virginia.
User ID and password combinations are a perimpersonation by another individual is not acceptable behavior.
The computing systems used for mail, WWW, and other technologically augmented services are similar to an assigned work or office space.
The space(and some of the
content) belongs to Bluefield State College and the State of West Virginia but other personal items may exist in the room.
In this sense BSC has an obligation to provide a assume full responsibility for it nor guarantee full privacy.
Similarly, as the ITE, certain information may be seen by those attending to the maintenance.
All employees of Information Technology are instructed that the disclosure of this information is a punishable offense(as is the willful intrusion without cause).
Also, in a similar manner, a person is allowed the use of certain space and accouterments and is expected to utilize them in a responsible manner by taking proper care, providing reasonable security, and respecting the property and privacy rights of others occupying similar spaces and their assigned, and private resources.
SECTION
COMMON FORMS OF VIOLATIONS 8.1 Although most users strive for acceptable and responsible use of the ITE, inexperienced users may unwittingly engage in behaviors that violate the principles and guidelines of responsible and acceptable use.
To that end, this section outlines some of the more common forms of violations that occur.
These examples should not be interpreted as an exhaustive list of violations.
Questions regarding the appropriateness of specific behaviors should be directed to Computing Services.
Furnishing false or misleading information or identification in order to access another user's account Using another person's username/password or permitting someone else to use your username/password Investigating, reading or attempting to access another user's files without permission Attempts to access or manipulate certain components of the information technology environment without authorization Alteration of software, data, or other files without authorization Disruption or destruction of equipment or resources Using subterfuge to avoid being charged for computer resources or deliberate, unauthorized use of another user's account to avoid being billed for services Copying or attempting to copy data or software without authorization Interfering with legitimate work of another user Sending abusive, harassing, or obscene messages Viewing or listening to objectionable, obscene, pornographic, or harassing material in public areas Excessive recreational use of resources Any activity or action that violates the Student Code of Conduct or Policies, faculty/staff policies and regulations, or federal, state, or local laws.
SECTION
Violation of these guidelines constitutes unacceptable use of information resources, and may violate other College policies and/or state and federal law.
Suspected or known violations should be reported to the appropriate ITE computing unit.
The appropriate College authorities and/or law enforcement agencies will process violations.
Violations may result in revocation of computing resource privileges, academic dishonesty proceedings, faculty, staff or student disciplinary action, or legal action.
The maintenance, operation, and security of computing resources require responsible College personnel to monitor and access the system.
To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a user's privacy will be preserved.
Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to the West Virginia Access to Public Records Act, other applicable state and federal laws, and the needs of the College to meet its administrative, business, and legal obligations.
The office of Computer Services is authorized to engage in investigations and apply certain penalties to enforce this policy.
These penalties include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of access privileges to any or all of the components of the ITE.
If, in the opinion of Computing Services, it is necessary to preserve the integrity of facilities, services, or data, Computing Services may suspend any access, whether or not the account owner is suspected of a violation.
In such a case, Computing Services will attempt to notify the user of any such action after the potential threat to the facilities, services, or data is contained.
If such an investigation is required it will be done only under the direct authorization of the Director of Computing Services and all effort will be made not to disclose any content to anyone other than those with a need to know during the investigation or adjudication of the alleged offense.
Consequences of the discovery and investigation process or normal maintenance might include the inspection of files contained in an individual's storage space or monitoring selected traffic on the networks.
Again, all effort will be made not to disclose any content to anyone other than those with a need to know.
However, where there are moral, ethical, or legal implications of the nondisclosure of such information Computing Services personnel are similarly instructed to contact the Director of Computing Services, who, may authorize its disclosure to appropriate authorities if deemed warranted.
In most cases an individual accused of a violation of this policy will be notified and have an opportunity to respond before a final determination of a penalty is made.
The Director of Computing Services or their designee, in conjunction with other responsible parties(e.g., College Council, Student Judicial Affairs, Academic Affairs, or Human Resources) will examine the available evidence and circumstances.
If a penalty is levied, the decision may be appealed through the appropriate channels.

University Use of Electronic Mail Electronic mail(e-mail) is a mechanism for official communication for Fredonia.
The university expects that such communications will be received and read in a timely fashion.

Official University E-mail Accounts An official university e-mail account is one in which the address ends with fredonia.edu. All students, faculty, staff, and departments are assigned an e-mail address and account.
The e-mail address is directory information.
As with other directory information, in compliance with federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act(FERPA) regulations, any student may request that his or her official e-mail address be restricted in its access.
Departmental account forwarding to individuals or groups is the responsibiliity of each department.

Expectations For Use of E-mail Students, faculty, and staff have the responsibility to use this e-mail in an efficient, effective, respectful, ethical and lawful manner.
Students, faculty, and staff are expected to check their e-mail on a frequent and consistent basis in order to stay current with university-related communications.
Unit heads that have exempted employees from the requirement of having an official e-mail account must make arrangements for alternative methods of access to official communications.
Students have the responsibility to recognize that certain communications may be time-critical.
I didn t check my e-mail, error in forwarding mail, or e-mail returned to the university with Mailbox Full or User Unknown, are not acceptable excuses for missing official university communications via e-mail.

Redirecting of E-mail If a student, faculty, or staff member wishes to redirect e-mail from their official @ fredonia.edu address to another e-mail address(e.g., @ aol.com, @ hotmail.com), they may do so, but at their own initiative and risk.
The university will not be responsible for the handling of e-mail by non-Fredonia providers.
Redirecting e-mail does not absolve students, faculty, or staff from the responsibilities associated with official communication sent to their @ fredonia.edu account.

Authentication for Confidential Information It is a violation of university policies, including the Student Code of Conduct, for any user of official e-mail addresses to impersonate a university office, faculty/staff member, or student.
To minimize this risk, some confidential information may be made available only through Your Connection which is password protected.
In these cases, students will receive e-mail correspondence directing them to Your Connection, where they can access the confidential information by supplying their FredoniaID and PIN.
The confidential information will not be available in the e-mail message.

Privacy Users should exercise extreme caution in using e-mail to communicate confidential or sensitive matters, and should not assume that e-mail is private and confidential.
It is especially important that users are careful to send messages only to the intended recipient(s).
Particular care should be taken when using the reply command during e-mail correspondence.

Educational and Administrative Uses of E-mail Faculty will determine how electronic forms of communication(e.g., e-mail, discussion boards, etc.)
will be used in their classes, and will specify their requirements in the course syllabus.
The official e-mail policy ensures that all students will be able to comply with e-mail-based course requirements specified by faculty.
Faculty can therefore make the assumption that students official @ fredonia.edu accounts are being accessed and faculty can use e-mail for their classes accordingly.
Administrative offices will determine how e-mail communications will be used for administrative purposes.

University Announcements Approval and transmission of e-mail containing essential university announcements to students, faculty and staff must be obtained from the appropriate authority.
Only the offices of vice presidents or the university president can authorize the sending of broadcast messages to a wide audience of students, faculty, and staff.
Mass mailing communications to external Fredonia.edu audiences must be accomplished utilizing an appropriately identified third-party service to mitigate the placement of fredonia.edu e-mail servers on spam blacklists.

Ownership/Administration Fredonia owns all e-mail accounts run on its domain.
Under certain circumstances it may be necessary for the Information Technology Services staff or other appropriate university officials to access e-mail files to maintain the system, and to investigate security or abuse incidents or violations of other institutional policies.
Such access will be on an as-needed basis and any e-mail accessed will be disclosed only to those individuals with a need to know or as required by law.
While incidental non-business personal use of e-mail is acceptable, conducting business for profit using university resources is forbidden.
Quota, maximum message size, message retention settings, time-out settings, maintenance times, and other e-mail guidelines will be set as appropriate for the anticipated volume and platform scaling.
The need to revise settings will be monitored with recommended changes as appropriate.
See e-mail guidelines at http://www.fredonia.edu/its/servicecenter/email.)

Termination E-mail accounts are provided to students and continued when they reach alumni status.
Email accounts are provided to faculty and staff as a component of electronic services while employed.
In certain cases, employee e-mail accounts may be continued for a longer period or forwarded for appropriate business conclusions.

Violations/Abuses Violation or abuse of the policy may result in restriction of access to Fredonia s e-mail system and/or other appropriate disciplinary action.
LISTSERVs

PAGE OF PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to establish and promote the ethical, legal, and secure use of computing and electronic communications for all members of the Creighton University(referred to in the document as either CU or the University) community.
This document complements the CU student handbook and is meant to establish our community policy for FAIR, RESPONSIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE USE OF ELECTRONIC RESOURCES.
Creighton University cherishes freedom of expression, the diversity of values and perspectives inherent in an academic institution, and the value of privacy for all members of the CU community.
At the same time, CU may find it necessary to access and disclose information from computer and network users' accounts to the extent required by law, to uphold contractual obligations or other applicable CU policies, or to diagnose and correct technical problems.
For these reasons, among others, the ultimate privacy of messages and files cannot be ensured.
In addition, system failures may lead to loss of data, so users should not assume that their messages and files are secure.
Although CU does not typically block access to online content, it reserves the right to do so in cases where online content or activity diminishes the capacity of our network or threatens the welfare of Creighton University or its core academic mission.
While CU does not position itself as a censor, it reserves the right to limit access to its networks or to remove material stored or posted on campus computers when applicable CU policies, contractual obligations, or state or federal laws are violated.
Alleged violations will be treated with the same fundamental fairness as any other alleged violation of CU policy, contractual obligations, or state or federal laws.
SCOPE This policy applies to all users of computer resources owned or managed by Creighton University, including, but not limited to, CU faculty and visiting faculty, staff, students, external persons or organizations and individuals using CU resources to access network services, such as the Internet and Intranet.
POLICY Introduction Creighton University(CU) values technology as a means of communicating information and ideas to the CU community and the world.
In keeping with Creighton s commitment to utilize technology in teaching and learning, this policy provides direction in the appropriate use of all forms of electronic resources on campus.
This document articulates Creighton University Policy on Fair, Responsible and Acceptable Use of Electronic Resources, provides examples of violations and outlines procedures for reporting, and addressing policy violations.

The -BW-04 at http://bw.edu/ITPolicies Though there are a number of reasons to provide user access to BW IT resources, by far the most common is granting access to students for educational/research purposes or employees for performance of their job functions.
This access carries certain responsibilities and obligations as to what constitutes acceptable use of the BW IT resources.
This policy explains how BW Information Technology resources are to be used and specifies what actions are prohibited.
While this policy is as complete as possible, no policy can cover every situation, and thus the user is asked additionally to use common sense when using BW IT resources.
Questions on what constitutes acceptable use should be directed to the HelpDesk, faculty advisor or if an employee, the user's supervisor.
Purpose Information Technology, and other University departments which operate and maintain computers, network systems, and servers, expect to maintain an acceptable level of performance and must assure that frivolous, excessive, or inappropriate use of the resources by one person or a few people does not degrade performance for others.
The campus network, computer clusters, mail servers, and other central computing resources are shared widely and are limited, requiring that resources be utilized with consideration for others who also use them.
Additionally, inappropriate use of BW systems can expose BW to legal, financial or other types of risk.
Therefore, it is important to specify what is permitted and what is prohibited.
The purpose of this policy is to detail the acceptable use of BW Information Technology resources for the protection of all parties involved.
Scope The scope of this policy includes any and all use of BW information resources, owned, managed or provided by
These IT resources include, but are not limited to, computer systems, cloud services, email, the network, and the BW Internet connection.
Also included are personally-owned devices, including student and contractor devices, that are attached to a BW network.
Policies 4.1 Network Access As the user will be given access to the BW network, Internet, and other IT resources, BW expects the user to use these resources in a responsible manner.
The user must make a concerted effort to avoid accessing network data, files, and information that are not directly related to his or her job function if employed by BW or role as a student attending
The existence of access capabilities does not imply permission to use this access.
Web Browsing and Internet Usage The Internet is a network of interconnected computers of which BW has very little control.
The user must recognize this when using the Internet, and understand that it is a public domain and he or she can come into contact with information, even inadvertently, that he or she may find offensive, sexually explicit, or inappropriate, or that may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
The user must use the Internet at his or her own risk.
BW is specifically not responsible for any information that the user views, reads, or downloads from the Internet.
1.
Personal Use BW recognizes that the Internet can be a tool that is useful for both personal and professional purposes.
Personal usage of BW computer systems to access the Internet is permitted as long as such usage follows pertinent guidelines elsewhere in this document and does not have a detrimental effect on BW operations or on the user's job performance.
2 Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Peer-to-Peer(P2P) file-sharing/networking applications(examples include but are not limited to Ares Galaxy, Vuze, Limewire, uTorrent, BitTorrent, eMule, Shareaza, Frostwire) are not allowed on the BW business network under any circumstance.
Students may use this technology on the student network provided by BW so long as it does not violate any other part of this policy such as prohibiting illegal activities.
3 Streaming Media Streaming media can use a lot of network resources and thus must be used carefully.
Reasonable use of streaming media for research or educational purposes is permitted on both the student and business network as long as it does not negatively impact the computer network or, if employed by BW, the user's job performance.
4 Blogging Blogging by BW's employees is subject to the terms of this policy, whether performed from the BW network, personal systems, or other external systems.
The user is asked to recognize that information posted on a blog immediately becomes public information and thus to exercise extreme discretion in the type of information posted.
In no blog or website, including blogs or sites published from personal or public systems, shall internal BW business matters be discussed, confidential or sensitive data be released, or material detrimental to BW be published.
additional guidance.
As long as BW policies, as specified herein, are followed, BW allows the publishing and use of blogs.
However, when done from the BW network or during business hours, blogging by employees of BW must either A) be business- resources.
The user assumes all risks associated with blogging.
5 Messaging The user should recognize that messaging technologies, such as and not limited to email, instant messaging, social media platforms, and SMS(text) messages, unless specific encryption measures are taken, are not considered secure methods of communication.
The user must follow all policies to prevent
the disclosure of confidential data, specifically that unencrypted confidential data, such as Credit Card Primary Account(PANs), student data or other sensitive data as defined by ITP-BW-04 Data Classification Policy and its supporting standards must never be sent via messaging technologies in an unencrypted form.
6 Bandwidth Usage Network bandwidth is a shared resource that must be used as such.
Excessive use of BW bandwidth or other computer resources, where not required by job function or role as a student, is not permitted.
Large file downloads or other bandwidth-intensive tasks that may degrade network capacity or performance must be performed during times of low BW-wide usage.
Students in the Residence halls may not monopolize internet bandwidth resources.
Examples of this include but are not limited to streaming services or gaming applications that generate an obsessive amount of network traffic.
BW may restrict bandwidth for certain services deemed non-critical to BW operations, or as it sees fit to preserve network functionality.
7 Social Networking/Social Media Social networking creates risks for BW in two ways:
in the potential sharing of BW confidential, private, or embarrassing information, and 2) the potential for an attacker to use posted information to craft a social engineering attack on
The user is asked to recognize that information posted on social networking sites is public information and to exercise extreme discretion in the type of information posted.
No confidential information or sensitive is to be posted on social networking sites.
Further, the user should restrict his or her privacy settings to the fullest extent possible.
The user must not publish any information detrimental to BW, its students, or employees that would cause embarrassment to BW on social networking sites.
As long as BW policies, as specified herein, are followed, BW allows reasonable use of social networking sites from its network and/or during business hours.
This use must either A) be business-related, or B) e and network resources.
The user assumes all risks associated with social networking.

Which wireless network should I use for my computer?
Current students, faculty, and staff should use Wellesley Secure.
Most devices can connect directly to the Wellesley Secure wireless network by selecting in their list of available networks when on campus.
When prompted to login, use your Wellesley Domain Account username and password.
On some devices you may need to accept, save, or trust a certificate from *.wellesley.edu to connect.
Visitors, guests, and non-computer devices may need to connect to Wellesley Guest for WiFi access.
If you do not have an active Wellesley domain account, you should connect to Wellesley Guest.
Also, if your device does not support WPA2-Enterprise encryption, such as many internet-of-things devices, try connecting the device to Wellesley Guest.
How do College-owned computers connect to the wired network?
Most faculty and staff College-owned computers now use WiFi rather than an ethernet cable, and in either case will authenticate to the network when you log into the computer with your Domain Account.
You will not need to login a second time, and you should not see a popup window.
Non-standard College-owned computers may prompt for your domain username and password the first time you connect to the network.
For details of what the prompt looks like and how to enter your Domain Account information, please see the links below: Windows Mac OS X Linux OS Chrome OS How do mobile devices connect to wireless?

Can Alumnae use the wireless network?
Connect to the eduroam WiFi network and enter your Wellesley domain username and password.
How do I connect other devices(e.g.
game consoles, internet TVs)?
Some devices are not capable of connecting to Wellesley Secure due to the type of encryption used(WPA2 Enterprise), or they require broadcast traffic to communicate with other devices.
If your device does not support WPA2 Enterprise encryption or requires broadcast traffic, try the Wellesley Guest WiFi network.
If that doesn't work, contact the Help Desk.
What devices work or don't work on the network?
Most internet enabled devices are designed to work on small home networks.
Since Wellesley's wireless network is much more complex, some devices may not work properly or at all.
If you device doesn't work on Wellesley Secure, you can contact the Help Desk and we will provide best effort support to try and get the device working.
At this time we don't have a list of what devices work or do not work on the network, except for wireless printers.
Wireless printers work by creating their own wireless network, which can interfere with the already very busy wireless signal of our access points and all the wireless devices in use in the residence halls.
They also tend to require static internet addresses so computers can always find them, which our network doesn't provide.
Because of these issues, we strongly recommend you disable wireless on your printer and use a USB cable to connect to your printer.
Why aren't wireless printers or personal routers allowed on campus?
Faculty, staff, and students are not allowed to set up personal wireless printers or routers(including Time Capsule and other backup systems that use WiF because they may interfere with the campus wireless network performance.
LTS may disable the device and attempt to contact the owner if needed.
As of May 2014, Wellesley also participates in eduroam.
If you are a visitor from an eduroam institution, you may connect to the eduroam WiFi network on campus.

Last Modified: 10/20/15 Wireless Network Standard Purpose The standard and guidelines described in this document will ensure the uniformity of wireless network access points at the University of Georgia.
These apply to all wireless networks at the University.
Development of the Wireless Network Standard Wireless networking equipment is available that supports varying levels of industry communication standards.
At present, the IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac standard is widely accepted throughout the industry and provides the necessary balance of range, network throughput, and support for device mobility to effectively serve most needs of the University community.
As newer standards emerge, such as IEEE 802.11enhancements, they will be evaluated and deployed should they offer security and throughput improvements over 802.11b/g/n/ac.
It is the University's goal to offer and maintain stable and reliable services for the benefit of the University community in the most cost effective manner for the institution.
EITS will continue to evaluate available wireless network industry standards and equipment to ensure the University meets this goal.
Definitions Wireless Access Point A wireless communications hardware device that creates a central point of wireless connectivity.
A wireless access point behaves much like a "hub" in that the total bandwidth is shared among all users for which the device is maintaining an active network connection.
Wireless Port A network port that has been installed for the purpose of connecting a wireless access point to the University's wired network.
Wireless ports provide both data and power service to the wireless access point.
Wireless client software or built in 802.1x supplicant EITS provides client software client that allows for a computer to utilize 802.1x authentication to the University s wireless networks.
Some operating systems have built-in support for 802.1x and

Page of can be used for accessing the University s networks.
The University provided client software will be preconfigured to support the specific setup for paws-secure.
Coverage Area The geographical area in which an acceptable level of wireless connection service quality is attainable.
Coverage areas for similar devices can vary significantly due to the presence of building materials, interference, obstructions, and access point placement.
Interference Degradation of a wireless communication radio signal caused by electromagnetic radiation from another source, including other wireless access points, cellular telephones, microwave ovens, medical and research equipment, and other devices that generate radio signals.
Interference can either degrade a wireless transmission or completely eliminate it entirely depending on the strength of the signal generated by the offending device.
Privacy The condition that is achieved by successfully maintaining the confidentiality of personal, student, employee, and or patient information transmitted over a wireless network.
Security Security is particularly important in wireless networks because data is transmitted using radio signals that, without implementation of specific data encryption mechanisms, can easily be intercepted.
Wireless Network Infrastructure The collection of all wireless access points, antennas, network cabling, power, ports, hardware, and software associated with the deployment of a wireless communication network.
Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP) A security protocol for wireless networks defined within the 802.11b standard.
WEP is designed to provide the same level of security as that of a wired network.
Recent reports indicate that the use of WEP alone is insufficient to ensure privacy unless used in conjunction with other mechanisms for data encryption.
WPA Short for Wi-Fi Protected Access, a Wi-Fi standard that was designed to improve upon the security features of WEP.
This technology features improved data encryption through the temporal key integrity protocol(TKIP) and user authentication through the extensible authentication protocol(EAP), PEAP MSChapV2.

Page of 802.1x This standard enhances the security of local area networks by providing an authentication framework allowing users to authenticate to a central authority, such as LDAP or Active Directory.
In conjunction with 802.11 access technologies, it provides an effective mechanism for controlling access to the wireless local area network.
Infrastructure Mode The operating mode for wireless networks in which each end user device is configured to associate with a wireless network access point through which network services are accessed.
Ad hoc Mode The operating mode for wireless service in which end user devices interact with each other in a "peer- to-peer" configuration.
Ad hoc mode does not require the use of a wireless network access point.
Utilization Prior to the installation of any wireless devices, EITS will review the usage requirements for the area in question to determine the optimum number of wireless access points needed to efficiently support all users in the area simultaneously.
Space configuration, construction materials, anticipated number of end users devices to be served, and potential sources of RF interference will be taken into consideration when conducting a site survey.
EITS will provide support for infrastructure mode installations only.
These installations require at least one wireless access point.
Ad hoc wireless mode will not be supported.
In order to prevent problems caused by radio interference, to ensure the integrity of University resources, and to ensure the widest availability of reliable wireless networking services, the University shall remain the sole owner of all unlicensed spectrums of radio frequencies available for use on any of its campuses and related properties.
Wireless Networking Guidelines Equipment Integration of wireless network access points or other wireless communications equipment to University of Georgia network will only be performed by EITS.
University students, faculty, staff, and units may purchase the Wi-Fi certified wireless network interface adapters of their choice to connect end user devices to the University's wireless networks.

Page of University units will be required to remove any wireless network infrastructure equipment(Wi-Fi routers, and bridges) not originally installed by EITS, and/or which were installed as a non-standard solution without written permission by the Chief Technology Officer.
Wireless network access points will be connected to the University's wired network by means of a specially designated wireless port that will be installed specifically for this purpose.
University units and individuals may not disconnect a wireless access point from its associated wireless port or interfere with any components of the wireless AP assembly including antennas, antenna cables, or management cables.
Wireless ports are specially configured to supply electrical power to the wireless access point and may cause permanent damage to an improperly connected end user device.
Wireless network installations at University locations consist of the necessary Wi-Fi certified wireless access point devices.
The minimum number of access points required will be determined by initial estimates of demand for users and the size of the area to be covered.
If the number of users to be served exceeds the practical number of users that can connect to single access point with sufficient bandwidth available to each user, additional access points may be installed contingent on budgetary approval.
In areas with a high density of users, such as classrooms and lecture halls, additional access points will be installed to satisfy the usage requirements.
All wireless access point devices will be installed, and maintained by EITS.
The primary funding source for initial and replacement purchases of wireless access point devices and services will be Student Technology Fee funds for academic areas and college/departmental budget funds for administrative/employee areas.
Network Reliability In order to ensure the reliable performance of the University's network, EITS will investigate reports of specific wireless devices that are suspected of causing interference and performance problems in the same manner in which EITS investigates reports of specific devices connected to wired ports that are suspected of causing disruption.
Although EITS will not actively monitor content carried on the University's wireless network radio frequencies when investigating reports of potentially interfering devices, wireless network detection equipment will be used to detect unauthorized wireless network equipment.
Units will be required to remove any such equipment found in unit- controlled University space.
Wireless access service is provided on the basis of anticipated utilization data gathered during initial site surveys conducted by EITS.
As the number of users increases, effective wireless network performance may be diminished.
Current industry standards for wireless network service do not provide sufficient throughput to effectively support bandwidth-intensive applications and network services.
EITS prohibits the use of server-based applications(file, web, media servers) on the University s wireless networks.

Page of EITS will address problems encountered in the use of wireless network services according to the following priority list: academic, research, administrative, and staff use.
Security Access to the University's wireless networks will require all authorized users in all areas to authenticate to the network using their assigned MyID username and password combinations or other approved authentication methods through the use of University provided wireless client software or 802.1x supplicant.
Network access logs will be maintained containing the username, time of access, and duration of use for all users who access the network using wireless connections and this information and will be provided to authorized governmental authorities if the University is required to release such information, such as in the cases of criminal investigations.
Wireless technology deployed at the University of Georgia includes the use of WPA(Wi-Fi Protected Access), which provides improved data encryption through the temporal key integrity protocol(TKIP) and user authentication through the extensible authentication protocol(EAP).
To provide additional security, all University wireless networks will require authentication of end users to the network upon connection of any wireless end user device using an 802.1x supplicant or provided wireless client software.
Each user will be required to authenticate to the network using a valid MyID and password.
The University's Central Directory Service will be used as the basis for authentication to services, including wireless network access.
University students, faculty, staff, and units must follow the terms of all applicable University acceptable use policies, network usage guidelines, and all applicable local, state, and federal regulations when using equipment connected to the University's network whether or not the individual is using wireless or wired network connections.
Violations of such guidelines will be reported to the University's Office of Information Security and may be forwarded to the appropriate University or governmental authorities.
University students, faculty, staff, and units are reminded that the use of wireless network connections may increase the risk that confidential information can be intercepted by unauthorized or unintended parties and that this risk in inherent in wireless network technology irrespective of security measures that can be implemented by the University.
Users should avoid sending or receiving confidential or other sensitive data via wireless connections whenever possible.
Wireless Usage Some services can have a negative impact on a wireless network because they generate a high level of activity on the network.
Such services can negatively affect your wireless network performance and the network performance of other wireless users.
The wireless network is a shared resource, which means the bandwidth available to each user of an access point will decline as high-bandwidth services are used.
If a student, faculty member, or staff member has a need for a service that requires high bandwidth, a wired network connection is recommended.

Page of The following list provides examples of high bandwidth usage.
Please note that this list is not all inclusive.
You cannot use the computer you have connected to the wireless network as a server of any kind, such as: Web servers Peer-to-peer file sharing servers FTP servers Multiplayer game servers An unsecured computer may have problems that will also result in high bandwidth usage.
Following are examples of possible problems: Infections by worms or viruses Compromised systems running ftp, IRC, or other services or malicious spyware programs Some activities may also use excessive wireless bandwidth.
Following are some examples of user activities that consume high amounts of bandwidth: Reinstalling an operating system Downloading and installing applications Performing system backups Transferring large files(images, video, music, databases) to other system Airspace Problems can occur if other devices use the same radio frequency range(2.4 GHz and GHz) as the wireless network.
Because of the potential for conflicts, it is important for all users to understand which technologies are permitted in our environment and which are not permitted.
In order to provide wireless network service at the highest level of quality, all non-client devices that use the 2.4 GHz and GHz ranges should be removed from service in any University building.
Only devices that are part of the University s wireless networks will be permitted to use the 2.4 and/or GHz ranges.
This includes any device that is used as a wireless base station or router, such as the Apple Airport Base Station, or any other wireless router.
Cordless phones, cameras, and audio speakers that use the frequency band of 2.4 GHz or GHz should also not be used in areas with wireless coverage.
If you think you have an existing system that may use 2.4 and/or GHz radios for transmission, please contact the EITS Help Desk at(706) 542-3106 to determine if such devices will interfere with wireless network service in your area.

In this document are the responsibilities and accepted behavior specific to people who use ResNet.
Policy Statement ResNet users are responsible for all network traffic originating from their computers, including email, Internet browsing, file transfers, peer-to-peer file sharing, instant messaging, video conferencing, social networking, and connections to other machines.
ResNet users are required to follow all University at Buffalo, Computing & Information Technology and Campus Living rules and policies.
ResNet residents must ensure that their computers present no identifiable risk to the network, e.
the computer has anti-virus software installed and up-to-date critical operating system updates applied.
ResNet users must be aware that: ResNet must be used in accordance with all copyright laws.
This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from using your computer in a way that would violate those laws such as operating unlicensed software or media distribution servers.
ResNet communication services, wiring and other hardware may not be modified or tampered with in any way, e.g.
installing an unauthorized wireless access point.
ResNet may not be used to post advertisements for personal business, or for the sale of products or services for commercial gain.
Harassment of other users, by any method, is a violation of the law and will not be tolerated.
ResNet cannot be used to misrepresent or hide your personal identity, e.g.
email sent from a fake or unauthorized address.
Return to Top Background To provide the highest quality access to information technologies, Campus Living and Computing & Information Technology(CIT) maintain computing networks that can connect each resident's personal computers and entertainment devices to the Internet.
The wired network(not wireless) is called ResNet.
Return to Top Procedure To initially connect to ResNet, users must insure that each computer presents no identifiable risk to the network, e.
has anti-virus software installed and up-to-date and operating system patches applied to date.
At any time that there is credible evidence that a ResNet user's computer has become a risk to the network, the user will be required to re-certify the computer's safe operation at his/her expense.
ResNet users are also expected to be responsible network citizens.
ResNet is a shared resource and as such, users should refrain from using any application that may interfere with the legitimate use of the network by others.
Think of your personal computer as your computing home.
It is advisable to "lock the front door" so that people cannot use your machine without your supervision.
Using a power-on password, or a screen saver password are good ways to control physical access to both the information on your computer, and your computer's access to ResNet.
Compliance At any time that there is credible evidence that a ResNet attached computer has become a risk to the network, ResNet access will be denied and the resident will be required to re-certify the computer's safe operation at his/her expense.
Violating any of these conditions of use may result in suspension or loss of ResNet usage privilege, expulsion from university residence halls or apartments, discipline from other university bodies such as the Student Judiciary, or criminal charges.
Damage or theft of ResNet wiring or hardware is the financial responsibility of the residence members.
If responsibility is traced to any individual or particular group of individuals, then they will be held personally responsible for the theft or damage.
Policy Review and Update The Chief Information Officer or his designee will periodically review and update this policy as needed.
Questions concerning this policy should be directed to the Office of the Associate VP for Information Technology.

Introduction The Hiram Campus Network is provided as a service to students, faculty, staff, and other members of the Hiram community.
Maintained by Hiram College Computer Center, the Network supports the instruction and strategic plan of the College.
This document outlines the policy of acceptable use of Hiram Campus Network resources, the effective protection of individual users, equitable access, and proper management of those resources.

Individual Responsibilities Hiram College strives to provide fair and distributed access to computing and network facilities for the entire community of users.
It is the intent of Hiram College to make information on the Internet available to the College community.
Members are responsible for selecting, viewing, and utilizing resources.
To foster trust and intellectual freedom, it is necessary to practice courtesy, common sense, and restraint in the use of shared resources.
Improper use of Hiram facilities may prevent others from gaining fair access to those facilities.
Furthermore, users must keep in mind that networks or systems outside of Hiram College(including those in other countries) may have their own distinctive policies and procedures.
Users are advised to learn and abide by the policies and procedures of these external networks.
Insofar as a secure and reliable computer system is necessary to the academic mission of the College, all members of the College community should contribute to the security of the system by conscientiously protecting their access privileges.
For example, users need to select a secure password andshould change their passwords every 90 days.
Users should never share their username and password with anybody nor should they ever use another person s login credentials.
Likewise, the computer system administrators will act promptly when evidence of serious compromises to the security of the system is detected.
The Hiram College computing network must work within finite limitations of bandwidth and disk space.
Users are reminded that online file storage exists on a space shared by other members of the community, and users are responsible for maintenance of their files.
Therefore users are encouraged to keep only pertinent materials in their network file share accounts.
The user should: Conserve disk space: delete unneeded files as soon as possible.
Be aware that email cannot be guaranteed to be perfectly private: others may intentionally or unintentionally forward or print your message, making it publicly available.
Like electronic mail the maintenance of a user s own storage area is the user s responsibility.
The user should: conserve server disk space; not maintain anything that the user considers to be private in the network storage area.
Files in network storage may be accessible by persons with system privileges.)

Conduct All users of the Hiram College Network must comply with all state and federals laws.
Activities that violate the Acceptable Use Policy include, but are not limited to, those in the following list: Using a computer account that does not rightfully belong to you.
Violating copyright laws and their fair use provisions through inappropriate reproduction, distribution, or peer-to-peer file sharing of copyrighted files(including movies, music, computer software, text, and images).
Using the Campus Information Technology(IT) infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems.
Unauthorized connecting of equipment to the campus network(this includes personal hubs /switches/routers and wireless routers in rooms).
Attempting to break into the system by circumventing data protection schemes or uncovering security loopholes.
This includes the wrongful use of programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or decrypt intentionally secure data.
Knowingly or negligently performing an act that will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, or networks.
Attempting to damage or to place excessive load on a computer system or network by using programs, such as(but not limited to) computer viruses, Trojan Horses, and worms.
Deliberately wasting or overloading computing or printing resources, or deliberately using excessive bandwidth on the network.
Violating terms of software licensing agreements.
Using College resources for non-academic commercial activity such as creating products or services for sale, without express College approval.
Using electronic mail or other Information Technology resources to abuse, harass, or intimidate members of the College community on any basis including race, ethnic origin, creed, gender or sexual orientation.
Users are reminded that sexually suggestive materials displayed inappropriately in public places, the classroom, or the workplace may constitute sexual harassment.
Propagating mass mailings with the intent of flooding( spamming or bombing) the accounts of others.
Forging the identity of a user or machine in an electronic communication.
Transmitting or reproducing materials that are slanderous or defamatory, or that otherwise violate existing laws or College regulations.
Attempting to wrongfully monitor or tamper with another user s use of the College s Information Technology infrastructure(such as reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user s files or software) without the knowledge and agreement of the owner.
Use of the College s network to download or store inappropriate materials(example: pornographic or illegally obtained copyright materials)
Authorization Personal use of Hiram College computing resources by staff employees during working hours is an issue that will be determined by the employee s supervisor.
Use of College computing and network facilities for non-academic commercial monetary gain requires the approval of the College and may require a written contract that gives full details of any financial obligation and/or charge for use, if any.
Connecting network devices, such as network hubs to the campus system will require authorization from the Director of Computing Services or his/her designee.
Setting up a domain on a computer located on the Hiram College network will require authorization from the Director of Computing Services or his/her designee.

Enforcement of Policies Failure to comply with any of the above policies may result in termination of network privileges, College disciplinary action, and/or criminal prosecution.
It is understood that users may unwittingly create problems for others by, for example, employing programs that monopolize the network bandwidth.
In such cases the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) will contact the user and explain why and how the user needs to modify his or her electronic behavior.
A policy clarification letter may be written.
In cases of repeated problematic behavior, the Director of Computing Services may recommend to the appropriate Dean or supervisor that a formal warning be placed in the user s College record.
Access to computing resources may be suspended temporarily at any time by the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) if there is clear evidence to suggest that the resource(s) are being used in a manner that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.
In such a case, the owner of the account will be sent notification of this action.
Upon suspension, a user can appeal the issue with the Director of Computing Services(or his/her designate) in order to reestablish an account.
