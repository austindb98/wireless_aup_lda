Unfortunately, the use of computing resources can be used improperly, sometimes quite unintentionally and, in rare instances, deliberately.
Accordingly, for both your personal benefit and the benefit of others, you must assume responsibility for making the best possible use of your privileges and for not abusing them. Computers and networks can provide access to resources on and off campus, as well as the ability to communicate with other users worldwide.
Such open access is a privilege, and requires that individuals act responsibly.
Users must respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. You are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your account.
IT Services grants permission to members of the UCLA community to use computing resources by issuing individual computing accounts including UCLA Logon IDs.
As a condition of receiving access to BOL services, you must observe the following guidelines: Use the facility in accordance with established policies and procedures.
Although UCLA Logon IDs are intended to be used for academic purposes, these accounts may be used for incidental personal use but not as a primary connection to the network/internet for individual or business units. Make economical and wise use of the facility resources that are shared with others, thus enabling access to these resources by the greatest possible number of users.
Make judicious use of one of the scarcest resources - the dial up modems. You must assume the responsibility for backing up your data and programs.
Protect important data and programs stored on tape or disk by duplicating them on backup tapes. Misuse of computing, networking, or information resources may result in the loss of computing privileges.
Additionally, misuse of a computing account will require financial restitution to the University for funds expended and could result in University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action. Users may be held accountable for their conduct under any applicable University or campus policies, procedures, or collective bargaining agreements.
Any actions which deter other users from doing their work or which would otherwise be deemed malicious by IT Services will result in the loss of access to the system and possible University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action. Both unauthorized use of the computer and use for personal gain constitute theft under California law and will be prosecuted by the University.
Furthermore, entering the computer facility with the intent, by whatever means, of discovering another's account number for purposes of stealing computer time constitutes burglary under California law and will be prosecuted. In support of the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service, Information Technology Services provides computing, networking, and information resources to UCLA's students, faculty, and staff.
IT Services provides the UCLA community with access to local, national, and international sources of information in an atmosphere that encourages sharing of information, access to a rich collection of services, and open and free discussion for academic purposes and other University-related uses.
For both your personal benefit and the benefit of others, you must assume responsibility for making the best possible use of your privileges and for not abusing them.
All existing laws(federal and state) and University regulations and policies apply, including not only those laws and regulations that are specific to computers and networks, but also those that may apply generally to personal conduct.
