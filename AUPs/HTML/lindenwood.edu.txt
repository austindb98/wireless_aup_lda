File Sharing software including(but not limited to), Aimster Ares(All versions) BearShare Bitorrent Bulbster Gnutella Hotline Imesh Kazaa(All versions LimeWire Madster Monolito Napster NeoNapster WinMX are prohibited on the Lindenwood University network(including residence halls, apartments, classrooms, public spaces, and faculty/staff offices).
Because the Lindenwood network and Internet connections are shared by many university services(the University Library, Lindenwood University website, Electronic Mail, etc.
the Lindenwood Information Technology departments actively monitors network traffic to ensure reliable service for everyone.
File sharing software can account for a large portion of traffic on our network.
As such, network traffic shaping may be used to address instances of misuse or policy violation.
Streaming media(such as streaming video, streaming audio programs, etc.)
are permitted as they use significantly less bandwidth.
However, during peak hours, any bandwidth-intensive application may be terminated to ensure continued services to the rest of the university.
If you have file sharing applications on your computer, you must remove them.
Simply disabling these applications may not mitigate their effect on the Lindenwood network as these applications share your computer with the entire Internet in the background, generating an enormous amount of traffic.
If you have any questions, please contact the Information Technology Help Desk at x5100.
Copyright Compliance As a part of its compliance with federal copyright law, Lindenwood University deploys a procedure to respond to bona fide notices of copyright violation by copyright holders.
This procedure operates as follows: The Digital Millennium Copyright Agent for the university requests that the Network Operations Center block the Internet Protocol(IP) address alleged by the notice to be in violation of federal law and provide the agent with the identity of the user or party responsible for the computer(responsible party).
The agent then notifies the user or responsible party of the notice and requests a cease and desist statement.
Upon receipt of that statement, the agent then requests that the Network Operations Center unblock the IP address.
Because intentional file sharing of material for which the user does not have the copyright holder's permission is a violation of the University policy, the user shall be reported to the Provosts Office for disciplinary processing.
In the case where the copyright notice is the result of a computer compromise(electronic activities that cause damage to a computer), or a "hacking," and not the intentional activity of file sharing on the part of the computers user, the agent shall instruct the user to fix the computer or to make an appointment with the Helpdesk(helpdesk@Lindenwood.edu) to have it fixed.
The agent will request the block be lifted upon receipt of information that the machine has been repaired.
