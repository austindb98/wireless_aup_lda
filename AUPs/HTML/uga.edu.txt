What is a wireless network?
A wireless network allows those without access to wired network ports access to online resources such as the Internet as well as the campus network.
It does so using the 802.11b or 802.11g wireless network standard which allows communication between a device such as a laptop or smartphone and a wireless access point connected to the campus network.
What constitutes acceptable use of the wireless network?
