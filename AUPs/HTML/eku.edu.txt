Section General The residential network(ResNet) is a shared resource and is just a small part of the entire EKU network system.
It exists to support the educational mission of our students and its use should be limited to this purpose.
Network use or applications that inhibit or interfere with the use of the network by others are not permitted.
For example, using an IP address not registered to you or applications which use an unusually high portion of the bandwidth(e.g., KaZaa, BitTorrent, Limewire) for extended periods of time, thus inhibiting the use of the network by others, are not permitted).
Section Privacy a. EKU respects legitimate privacy interests of students within appropriate limits for educational, ethical, and legal reason.

Networking routinely monitor the volume of ResNet traffic for system management purposes, but not the content of packets.
ResNet does not use sniffing, key stroke tracking, data mining, decryption, or other technologies to examine ResNet traffic unless there are compelling reasons to do
Reasons that privacy may be limited include, but are not limited to:
They perform monitoring in order to try to protect the network and users from viruses, hackers, and other malicious attempts to compromise the security of EKU s computing infrastructure.
Malfunctioning equipment or other situations, such as unusually large, sustained usage which threatens others ability to access shared resources.
Clear evidence of fraud, harassment, violation of copyright, threats, or other violations of EKU s Code of Ethics for Computing and Communication, university rules, or state or federal laws.
A valid subpoena or search warrant.
Section Authorized Use An authorized user is any person who has been granted authority by the University to access its computing and network systems and whose usage complies with this policy.
Authority to use a particular University computing or network resource should come from the campus unit responsible for operating the resource.
Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
The term authorized user, user, and student user are hereinafter used interchangeably.
University supplied E-keys(usernames and passwords) are the property of the University.
The University may revoke these identifiers or sign-ons at any time.
Default passwords should be changed immediately.
Passwords associated with an individual s E-key should not be shared without authorization.

A lot of the malware(viruses and spyware) contracted today are a result of these three common issues from emails, instant messengers, chat programs, and social networking websites such as Facebook or MySpace.
Unless you re waiting on and expecting an attachment or a link from someone DO NOT OPEN OR CLICK ON
This is a very common way for malware to spread.
Another common spreading tool involves pop-ups even if you aren t actually on the Internet.
These programs usually masquerade as legitimate software such as spyware or virus removal programs, registry cleaners, or codecs.
They make exaggerated claims about your computer safety so you will install them.
But they are, in fact, viruses and spyware!
Section Private Computers Connected to the University Network Prohibited Activities To maintain network performance, the conditions listed below are strictly prohibited.
