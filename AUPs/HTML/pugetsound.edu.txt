To ensure all network users are able to access academic resources, the university employs a network traffic shaping system.
Specific network activities generating heavy traffic, usually caused by uploading and downloading large files, are monitored and controlled to keep Internet traffic flowing smoothly for the campus.
Excessive Use Individual computers identified by the monitoring software as transferring data in excess of acceptable limits will have their Internet connections limited automatically by the network.
This may happen at any time without notice.
Please keep in mind that computers infected with spyware or a virus may increase network traffic without the user's knowledge.
Taking appropriate precautions and performing periodic computer maintenance are encouraged.
Network Equipment Setting up wireless access points, switches, hubs, routers, and other wireless network equipment without approval by Technology Services is strictly prohibited.
Technology Services appreciates responsible use of the university s network resources.
