This may be done only with the understanding that, should a conflict exist, the University Acceptable Use Policy(AUP) takes precedence over all local policies developed within the department for the explicit purpose of exercising responsible controls at the local level.

The threat is real, as each month, DSU intercepts tens of thousands of viruses and suspicious messages containing executable files trying to bypass our security systems.
These controls also help minimize the potential risks of misuse.
This misuse includes unnecessary Internet usage causing network and server congestion.
