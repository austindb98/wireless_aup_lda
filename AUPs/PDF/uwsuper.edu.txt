Background and Purpose Wireless service has increased mobility and flexibility for many campus departments.
As the use of cellular phones and wireless devices grows, so does the cost to the campus.
In the interest of insuring that the best quality service for the most economical cost is obtained, this policy covers the acquisition and use of cellular phones, blackberry devices and laptop/other equipment that utilizes wireless communication to transfer data.
Employees must consider other viable options such as a landline phone, university calling cards, university internet access, pagers or other less expensive communication devices before approving the costs for electronic mobile devices and services.

Definitions Wireless communication is the transfer of information over a distance without the use of electrical conductors or wires.
The distances involved may be short(a few meters as in television remote control) or very long(thousands or even millions of kilometers for radio communications).
When the context is clear the term is often simply shortened to "wireless".
Wireless communication is generally considered to be a branch of telecommunications.
It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and cellular telephones, personal digital using either analog or digital signal to a network of transmitters to make connections to regular or other mobile telephone lines.
